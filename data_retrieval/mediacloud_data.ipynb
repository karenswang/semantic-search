According to LPD, officers responded to the 1600 block of Massachusetts Avenue at 11:19 p.m. for reports of a domestic violence situation where a person was armed and someone was shot. LPD added that once police arrived at the scene, an officer encountered an armed suspect and said this was when the police shooting took place. Law enforcement secured the suspect and attempted first aid. The Lansing Fire Department then took the man to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. LPD officials said a handgun was recovered at the scene and there were no other injuries. 6 News spoke to neighbors Saturday afternoon who claimed that the shooting had taken place in the space between two houses on the street. They also said that they had heard two sets of gunshots, and what had appeared to be two different guns. When 6 News made contact with a person at the house where the incident had occurred, they said they were not ready for an interview. They did say, however, that they had lost a loved one at the hands of the Lansing Police Department. Per department policy, the investigation has been turned over to the Michigan State Police.\",\n",

The video was taken at about 4:26 p.m., but a time stamp on the video is an hour ahead, Barker said.\\u00c2 Police placed spike strips at Highway P and Royal Oaks, one of the entrances to the neighborhood, but Phipps instead turned the opposite direction on Royal Oaks and accelerated farther into the neighborhood and out of sight, Barker said. Barker, who has lived in the neighborhood for 24 years, said he didn't recognize Phipps. He often hears sirens on Highway P, but they're usually ambulances or firetrucks, he said. \\\"To hear sirens and then see this unusually slow pursuit was very unusual,\\\" Barker said. \\\"It was nothing like you would see on TV. \\\"This is going to be talked about in our subdivision for quite a long time.\\\" The clock tower had visible damage on Monday.\\u00c2 Sunday's shooting was the third\\u00c2 fatal police shooting in O'Fallon since January 2019, when an officer shot and killed an armed 64-year-old man during a mental health check\\u00c2 at the man's home. O\\u00e2Fallon police said at the time that the officer feared for his and a mental health worker's life. The man's family sued the police department in August of this year claiming wrongful death. And in January 2022, police officers shot and killed a teen in a car on a cul-de-sac while responding to a call for a \\\"suspicious vehicle.\\\" Police said they loudly knocked on the car window and spotted a handgun in the front seat before the driver reversed the car into a police vehicle and tried to drive off. The teen's family said he and a friend were sleeping in the car after visiting another friend in the area. The St. Charles County Prosecutor's office later declined to press charges against the officers, releasing video of the incident and saying the officers believed their lives were at risk.\\u00c2 The incident Sunday is being investigated by the county's\\u00c2 Critical Incident Response team, a group formed in 2022 that includes lieutenant commanders and detectives from the St. Charles County, Cottleville, Lake St. Louis, O\\u00e2Fallon, St. Charles, St. Peters and Wentzville police departments. The investigators eventually turn over their findings to the St. Charles County prosecutor. Phipps' family could not be reached Monday. O'Fallon police released a mugshot of Phipps but did not provide information about whether he was previously known to the department. Court records show Phipps had a lengthy criminal history in St. Charles, Lincoln and Warren counties including domestic assault, burglary, theft, trespassing and driving while intoxicated. Phipps also had several restraining orders filed against him, including two in 2022.\\u00c2 The shooting in O'Fallon happened hours before a man was\\u00c2 killed by a police officer in Lake St. Louis\\u00c2 after a struggle over a gun. In that case, police said they were investigating a report of a shooting when a man walked toward them with two handguns and fought with police when they tried to disarm him.\\u00c2 Kim Bell of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.\\u00c2\",\n",

Upon arrival, officers found the calling party, an adult female, who informed police the suspect was in the backyard making suicidal statements. According to police, officers made contact with the suspect, an adult male, and attempted to pat him down when he pulled out a firearm. Officers attempted to de-escalate the situation and told the suspect to put down the gun. The suspect pointed the gun at police and an officer fired their gun, shooting the suspect. The suspect was taken to an area hospital where he was later pronounced deceased. No officers were harmed in the shooting. Chief Joe Sullivan of the WPD says the incident was tragic and he is confident that officers handled the situation according to policy.

The New York Police Department said 38-year-old Courtney Gordon was shot and killed at the scene after he attacked two officers outside the house. Police didn't identify the victims by name but described them as an 11-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, and a man in his 30s. A fifth person, a 61-year-old woman, was stabbed multiple times and taken to a hospital, where police said she is in critical condition. Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey broke the news at a media briefing from the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. He said a \\\"young female\\\" called 911 around 5:10 a.m. local time and told dispatchers her cousin was killing family members in a Queens home. Maddrey said when police arrived at the scene, they saw a man who was carrying luggage and walking down the driveway. The man then stabbed one of the officers in the neck and chest before slashing the other officer in the head. Police said one of the officers shot the suspect. He was taken to the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and pronounced dead. Maddrey said a young girl was found dead outside the home, which was on fire. Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny said investigators believe the suspect set fire to a couch inside the home after the murders. Once the fire department put out the fire, police went inside the home and found three more bodies, as well as the fifth victim. Maddrey said police found what they believe is the murder weapon -- a steak knife -- in the house. The investigation will determine if this was used to harm all the victims,\\\" Maddrey said. Kenny said Gordon had one previous arrest, as he was charged in connection to a strangulation/domestic violence incident in the Bronx. \\\"It seems he was a Bronx resident who was visiting family members at this location,\\\" Kenny said. The president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York also spoke at the briefing. He described the suspect as a madman and praised responding officers, who included a a 28-year veteran and a 16-year veteran. \\\"This scene was chaos -- multiple victims, a house on fire, and a madman on a rampage, on a mission,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm thankful that these police officers showed up. Imagine what could have happened if these police officers weren't there.\\\" \\\"This madman tried to kill -- after he killed others -- a New York City police officer. The skill that this police officer had (by) shooting and stopping the threat after he was being stabbed -- unbelievable skill. I know both these police officers personally. (They) did an unbelievable job. True professionals,\\\" he continued. \\\"(They) are great men who were doing their jobs. And again, thank God they were there ... how many more victims could there have been if these skilled, professional police officers did not show up to this scene,\\\" he added.\\\" Maddrey said the officers are recovering at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center while the investigation continues to be ongoing. \\\"These are two experienced police officers ... they did an excellent job,\\\" he said.\",\n",

About 5:10 a.m. police received an emergency call from a young woman who said that her cousin was killing her family members, the chief of department, Jeffrey Maddrey, said at a news conference Sunday morning. Two officers who responded to the location, 467 Beach 22nd St. in the Far Rockaway neighborhood, saw a man leaving with luggage, Maddrey said. When they stopped him, the man stabbed one officer in the head and the other in the neck with a steak knife before one of the officers shot him. The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The wounds of the officers were not life-threatening, Maddrey said at the news conference, which was in front of Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where they were being treated. As other officers arrived, they found an 11-year-old girl lying in front of the house, and she was pronounced dead, Maddrey said. The house had been set on fire, and the officers could enter the home only after firefighters had extinguished the fire. They found three more victims inside two bedrooms at the back of the home: a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman and a man in his 30s, all of whom they believed had been stabbed to death, he said. Officers also found a 61-year-old woman, who had multiple stab wounds and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. It was unclear whether the same knife had been used for all the victims. Joseph Kenny, the department\\u2019s chief of detectives, identified the suspect as Courtney Gordon, 38, whom police believe was a resident of the Bronx and was visiting family members in Queens.

      "                    \"snippet\": \"DECATUR, Ala. (AP) \\u00e2 An Alabama city has fired three police officers connected to the fatal shooting of a Black man in front of his own home during a dispute with a tow truck driver. Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling announced the decision Thursday night after the conclusion of personnel hearings. The mayor\\u2019s office did not name the officers or the specific reasons for their dismissal. The city police chief said previously that departmental policies were violated with the shooting. A fourth officer was suspended, the mayor said. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency\\u00e2s review of the shooting is ongoing, a spokesman said Friday. The findings will be turned over to the local district attorney and grand jury to determine if criminal charges are merited or if the officers acted within the bounds of the law. Steve Perkins, 39, was shot and killed by police on Sept. 29 when officers accompanied a tow truck driver trying to repossess Perkins\\u00e2 truck. Authorities said in September that Perkins had brandished a handgun, which was also equipped with a light, \\u00e2causing the officer to fire at Perkins.\\u00e2 Video from a neighbor\\u00e2s home surveillance camera video, published by WAFF-TV, captured the shooting. The video shows the tow truck back into the driveway and Perkins come out of his house. An officer or officers appear to run out from beside the house. One is heard shouting, \\u00e2Police, get on the ground,\\u00e2 and a large number of shots are immediately fired in rapid succession. The Perkins family issued a statement calling the dismissals a \\u00e2step in the right direction,\\u00e2 but they want to see more done. \\u00e2Three officers being fired and one being suspended is no comparison to Catrela losing her husband, me losing my brother, my mom losing her son, that\\u00e2s not justified. We want these officers prosecuted\\u00e2 Nicholas Perkins told WHNT-TV. \\u00e2We deserve more, Catrela definitely deserves more, this Perkins Family deserves more. And so we won\\u00e2t give up until we get what we deserve.\\u00e2 The fatal shooting has drawn regular protests in the north Alabama city. Protestors carried signs reading \\u00e2You could have knocked\\u00e2 and \\u00e2We need answers.\\u00e2 Police have not released the race of the officers. The Decatur Police Department\\u00e2s initial statement in September about the shooting said that officers were called to the scene by the tow truck driver, who said the homeowner pulled a gun when he tried to take the truck. The department said that after officers accompanied the tow truck driver back to the home, Perkins threatened the driver and \\u00e2turned the gun toward one of the officers.\\u00e2 Perkins\\u00e2 family said that the neighbor\\u2019s security camera video refutes that version of events. An attorney for the family said officers immediately opened fire on Perkins and that he did not appear aware of their presence until he was being shot. Perkins\\u00e2 family issued a statement saying the truck payments were up to date, so the truck shouldn\\u00e2t have been towed. Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion in October issued a public apology saying the department had initially given inaccurate information about the shooting. The department\\u00e2s initial September statement said that before opening fire that officers ordered Perkins to drop his weapon and that he refused to do so. Pinion said officers did not tell him to drop his weapon but had said, \\u201cget on the ground.\\u00e2 Pinion said Thursday that he and the mayor visited with Perkins\\u2019 family to deliver the news about the dismissals. \\u00e2I have pledged to take action to ensure something like this never happens in Decatur again, and that process has begun in earnest,\\u00e2 Pinion wrote in a statement.

While the details of what led to the knife attack are still unclear, police said they believe the suspect and the majority of the victims were all family members. Two of the victims were pre-teen children. During a news conference, New York Police Department Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said a 911 call came in just after 5 a.m. from a young woman who said her cousin was killing her family members. Two officers responded to a group of homes on E 22nd Street in the Far Rockaway neighborhood where the call came from. When they got to the home, they saw a man in the driveway carrying luggage who appeared to be leaving, Maddrey said. The officers approached the man and asked if he had seen or heard anything. Maddrey said the man drew a knife and stabbed one officer in the neck and the second officer in the head before one of them was able to take out their gun and shoot the attacker. Both officers, who have over a decade of service in the police force, were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and are expected to be okay, Maddrey said. As police continued to investigate the scene, they found an 11-year-old girl who was dead from apparent stab wounds right outside of the home. A couch had been set on fire inside the home, preventing officers from getting inside until the fire department responded to put it out. Once they were able to enter, they found more victims. A 12-year-old boy, a man in his 30s and a 44-year-old woman were all found stabbed to death in bedrooms in the back of the home. A 61-year-old woman, also suffering from stab wounds, was taken from the home to a local hospital for treatment and is currently in critical condition, police said. The suspect was identified as 38-year-old Courtney Gordon. After he was shot by officers, he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Police said Gordon had one prior arrest on record for strangulation in a domestic incident, but that incident occurred in the Bronx. It is believed he used a \\\"typical kitchen steak knife\\\" in the attack, according to police. The investigation is ongoing. Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com\",\n",

Lawyers representing the parents of Jack Murray said at a news conference that they are launching an investigation into the shooting, which police say occurred when the 24-year-old confronted officers outside his home with a knife. Family attorney Antonio Romanucci said his clients believe the Elk Grove Village Police Department was familiar with Murray and knew he occasionally called them for help when he was dealing with physical or emotional distress. \\\"That Friday afternoon, on Dec. 1, Jack was in distress,\\\" Romanucci said during the news conference attended by Murray's parents and siblings. \\\"He felt he was mentally and physically not right.\\\" Romanucci said his law firm's investigation will focus on the officers' treatment of a known emotionally distressed person and their use of de-escalation tactics. He also called for \\\"immediate transparency\\\" from police, through the release of 9-1-1 call recordings and all relevant police body camera and dashboard camera footage. \\\"His family is deeply grieving and deserves answers on exactly what happened that Friday afternoon,\\\" Romanucci said. \\\"We simply will not accept the police narrative or their version of the events that happened. We want truth and we want transparency.\\\" Police have said officers responded to the 200 block of Fern Drive at about 4:30 p.m. Friday after a 9-1-1 calling regarding a man with a knife. Murray was shot after he confronted officers with a knife in a nearby yard, according to the police account. He was taken by ambulance to Ascension Alexian Brothers Medical Center, where he later was pronounced dead, authorities said. Romanucci said Monday that Murray's family was told at the hospital that he was \\\"a crime scene\\\" and as a result they were prevented from seeing him. \\\"For as long as I've been doing this, I have never encountered a family being denied (the ability) to say goodbye,\\\" he said. In a statement Monday, Elk Grove Village and the police department offered condolences to the Murray family for what they described as \\\"Friday's tragic incident.\\\" An independent investigation into the deadly shooting is being conducted by the Major Case Assistance Team, officials said. \\\"The Elk Grove Village Police Department has already provided MCAT investigators footage of the body-worn cameras, and vehicle camera footage is available for their review,\\\" the statement reads. \\\"Additionally, the Elk Grove Village Police Department has been conducting a parallel criminal investigation in order gain a complete understanding of the events that led to the incident.\\\" As required by department police, five officers who responded Dec. 1 are on temporary administrative leave as the investigation continues, officials said. Not all were involved with the use of lethal force, according to the statement. \\\"We plan to share additional information about this incident publicly, including the audio from 9-1-1 dispatch, as well as the audio and video footage from the officers' body-worn and vehicle cameras,\\\" the statement adds. \\\"We know that sharing this information in a transparent way will help our community better understand the events that unfolded last Friday afternoon. It is our goal to share this information as soon as we are can, after crucial investigative steps have been taken.\\\" Murray's aunt, Liz Belcaster, said at Monday's news conference that the family still has many unanswered questions about what transpired Friday afternoon. \\\"Jack was only 24 years old. He was just starting his life. He was challenged by his health issues, being a Type I diabetic,\\\" she said. \\\"It impacted him physically and was also a significant emotional challenge.

(AP) - A man featured in the hit podcast \\\"S-Town\\\" that chronicled events in a rural Alabama community was shot and killed by police during a weekend standoff in the town, authorities said Monday. Joseph Tyler Goodson, 32, of Woodstock, was shot and killed by officers after he barricaded himself inside a home and \\\"brandished a gun\\\" at officers early Sunday, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. The agency's statement said the Woodstock Police Department had initially responded to a \\\"call for service\\\" early Sunday and the standoff ensued. Multiple law enforcement agencies converged on the home. The statement said Goodson was shot by officers during the confrontation and was subsequently pronounced dead. RELATED: 'Wolf-hybrid' pet kills 3-month-old boy in Alabama, sheriff says The state agency did not describe what led to the initial call to the home. \\\"Police bout to shoot me down in my own yard,\\\" a message posted early Sunday on Goodson's Facebook account read, news outlets, WIAT and al.com reported. The state agency is reviewing the shooting and will turn its findings over to the Bibb County district attorney. The 2017 podcast, which won a Peabody Award, told the story of an Alabama man named John B. McLemore, who died before the show came out. McLemore's use of an expletive to describe his hometown gives the podcast its abbreviated title. \\\"S-Town\\\" begins telling the story of a reputed killing and also another death and winds up focusing on McLemore and his tortured relationship with the town of Woodstock. Several people in his life were also featured, including Goodson.

The rampage took place before dawn at a house in Far Rockaway, a seaside section of Queens. Police were summoned to the home at about 5:10 a.m. when a \\u00e2young female caller\\\" dialed 911 and said her cousin was killing her family, the NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said at a morning news briefing. When the officers pulled up to the driveway, they stopped a man leaving the area with luggage and after just a few seconds, he drew a knife and attacked. One of the officers was stabbed in the area of his neck and chest, the other was slashed in the head before one of them shot the assailant, Maddrey said. An 11-year old girl was found in front of the house and taken to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead from stab wounds. Police weren\\u00e2t immediately able to enter the home because of a fire that consumed the living room and foyer, but once inside they found three more people fatally stabbed; a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman and a man in his 30s. Another woman, 61, was gravely injured in the attack. She is in critical condition suffering from multiple stab wounds. Both injured police officers are expected to recover. Phone messages left with possible neighbors of the family were not immediately returned. The suspect was identified as Courtney Gordon, 38, who police said had been visiting the family from his home in the Bronx. The identities of his victims were not immediately disclosed. \\u00e2This scene was chaos. Multiple victims, a house on fire, and a madman on a rampage, on a mission,\\\" Patrick Hendry, the head of the New York Police Department's police union, said at the media briefing. \\u00e2The skill that this police officer had shooting and stopping the threat after he was being stabbed.

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) \\u2014 The male driver of a semitruck died in a police shooting Thursday night after a 911 caller told police they heard a woman yelling for help inside the parked vehicle near a restaurant on the southwest side of Indianapolis. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department says no officers were hurt. Medics treated the woman at the scene before she was taken to the downtown IMPD homicide office to be interviewed. Police hoped to learn the relationship between her and the driver. The name of the driver nor the woman were publicly shared Thursday night. IMPD was sent to a \\u201ccall for help\\u201d involving a hostage situation about 7:20 p.m. Thursday at McDonald\\u2019s, 4941 Knights Way. That\\u2019s in an area with restaurants, hotels and truck stops just southwest of the interchange for I-69 and I-465. Medics were called to the scene for a person shot just before 7:45 p.m. Thursday. Lt. Shane Foley of IMPD says officers arrived to learn of a disturbance inside the semitruck and then forced their way into the cabin. The officers saw what appeared to be a hostage situation, Foley says. Assistant Chief Chris Bailey described what happened during an impromptu news conference about 10:30 p.m. that aired live on News 8. He talked about a lieutenant who moved into the cab to try to talk to the driver before the fatal shooting. \\u201cTonight, this officer saved a woman\\u2019s life,\\u201d he said. Officers arrived and spoke with the 911 caller, who pointed out the semitruck. They knocked on the door and saw the driver come from behind a curtain that separates the driving compartment from the sleeping compartment. Police tried to talk to the driver, who briefly sat in the driver\\u2019s seat before returning back to the sleeping compartment. \\u201cThat\\u2019s when the officers heard themselves a female scream from the back of that truck,\\u201d Bailey said. Officers sat up around the semitruck and made announcements. Eventually, police decided to break out the driver\\u2019s-side window to better see into and hear from the cab. In addition to the curtain separating the compartments, a curtain also was over the driver\\u2019s-side window. Bailey said, \\u201cThe lieutenant at one point opened the door and began communicating with the male inside \\u2026 the truck. The lieutenant asked the individual to identify himself. The lieutenant identified himself by first name. He was attempting to build a rapport with this individual. This individual kept saying he had a knife to the woman\\u2019s throat. All the while, the woman could be heard screaming that she was bleeding and needed help. This went on for a few minutes. \\u201cThe lieutenant, in my opinion, bravely inched into the car on multiple occasions to move the curtain back so he could see and continue to try to communicate with the individual inside the cab.\\u201d IMPD later reported that the driver told officers multiple statements, including \\u00e2I\\u00e2m going to kill her,\\u201d \\u00e2I got a knife to her throat,\\u00e2 and \\u00e2You\\u00e2re gonna die.\\u00e2 Eventually, the lieutenant got inside the semitruck and gave the driver orders again. \\u201cYou can briefly see, on the bodycam, the individual on top of the woman in back of the car. A shot was fired by the officer. The suspect was deceased inside the cab of the truck,\\u201d Bailey said. The assistant chief says other officers then came and freed the woman from the semitruck. Officers were seeking other witnesses at the scene in addition to the 911 caller. IMPD about 8:45 p.m. Thursday was awaiting warrants to search the semitruck, but the investigators were inside the semitruck by 10:30 p.m. An IMPD news release issued about 11:20 p.m. said a razor blade with blood was found in the sleeping cabin. Multiple officers were equipped with body-worn cameras, which were activated.\\u00e2\\u00af As is standard procedure, investigations will look into what happened and the police procedures used. The lieutenant will be placed on administrative leave. Bailey says other officers on the scene also may receive time off to process what happened. The police shooting was the 17th in 2023. It\\u2019s the most police shootings since 20 were recorded in 2015. Police generally release the names of officers in the shootings about a week after they happen. Bodycam footage is usually shared a few weeks later. Earlier this month, IMPD revealed it\\u2019s reached out to the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum to submit a bid to conduct a study on what\\u2019s causing so many police shooting to happen. However, that process has yet to come to fruition, Bailey said Thursday night. After another police shooting, IMPD Deputy Chief Kendale Adams spoke at an August event, where he acknowledged the need for a larger conversation about what it looks like to deal with mental health, disputes, and trauma.

Since Aug. 1, there have been 13 officer-involved shootings, with nine of the shootings resulting in fatalities. Each officer-involved shooting opens up multiple investigations and processes that go through different IMPD leadership, boards and community groups. \\u201dThis investigation is being led by the Critical Incident Response Team,\\u201d said IMPD Asst. Chief Chris Bailey, at the scene of the shooting Thursday night. \\u201cA parallel administrative investigation will be conducted by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Dept.

Chief Catherine Cummings about how the board operates in October. \\u201cThe board takes whatever particular use of force incident we are presenting to them,\\u201d Cummings said. \\u201cThey go through the hours or day-long hearing. They hear from the people involved, they hear from the experts.\\u201d Once the hearing is complete, the board provides its recommendation to Chief Taylor. \\u201cThe board provides their recommendation to the Chief,\\u201d Cummings said. \\u201cWhether they feel that the actions were in policy or out of policy and then the Chief takes that into consideration when he\\u2019s making his final determination.\\u201d The board is made up of four members from IMPD and five civilian members. Two are appointed by Chief Taylor and three are appointed by the City-County Council. In the days after the shooting, IMPD pays the company Critical Incident Videos $6,000 to create a critical incident video of the incident. IMPD passes along body camera video, 911 calls, security camera video and more resources from the scene. FOX59/CBS4 spoke with IMPD Lt. Shane Foley about the process that goes into every critical incident video. \\u201dWe do that because we find it\\u2019s important that we have that third-party vendor that\\u2019s producing the video and doing it independently from the work that were doing,\\u201d Foley said. Once IMPD gets the video back, it\\u2019s watched by leadership that does have the ability to make changes if they feel there are inaccuracies. Before the video is released, it\\u2019s shown to the officer or officers involved and the person shot or family of the person shot. The video is also watched by a community group. Foley said it is made up of more than 50 members of the community, some from each IMPD district. \\u201cThey let us know what type of content they want to see, if it meets their expectations for what they want shared and it helps them process and gain a better understanding of what\\u2019s taking place during these incidents,\\u201d Foley said. Of the 17 officer-involved shootings, nine videos have been released, two have been court-ordered to not be released and another is an ISP investigation. IMPD will not release that video until ISP concludes its investigation. That leaves five videos that have not been released yet, including the most recent. According to IMPD data, the Marion County Prosecutor\\u2019s Office has only made charging decisions for officers involved in two of the shootings. Charges in the 15 other incidents are still pending.\",\n",

      "                    \"snippet\": \"Five family members have died, including one deceased perpetrator who police say is from the Edenwald section of The Bronx and is a cousin to some of the other deceased family members, following a multiple stabbing incident, residential fire, and police-involved shooting in the Far Rockaway section of Queens in the early hours of Sunday morning, Dec. 3. Two police officers and another family member were also injured during the incident. During a press conference held later on Sunday, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey was joined by NYPD Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny, NYPD Chief John Chell, Kevin Williams, NYPD assistant chief of Patrol Borough Queens South, the department\\u2019s chief surgeon, doctors from Jamaica hospital, and Pat Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association, and provided an overview of the incident. Maddrey said that at around 5:10 a.m. on Sunday morning, at 467 Beach 22nd Street, situated at the end of a driveway adjacent to four to five other homes in a residential area of the Far Rockaway section of Queens, officers received a 911 call regarding an assault in progress. \\u201cBasically, a young female caller stated that her cousin is killing her family members,\\u201d Maddrey said. \\u201cTwo of our members from the 101 Precinct, a 28-year-veteran, and a 16-year-veteran in a marked vehicle doing patrol responded to the location.\\u201d Maddrey continued, \\u201cThe officers, they pull up to the driveway. As they get to the driveway, they see a male walking out. He\\u2019s carrying luggage. Our officers asked the male a question or two. That encounter lasted about 10 seconds, when the male draws a knife on the officers. He stabbed one officer in the neck / chest area. He strikes the second officer in the head. Our 28-year-veteran is able to withdraw his firearm. He\\u2019s able to discharge his weapon to stop the assault and he was able to stop the perpetrator.\\u201d Maddrey said the two officers were transported to Jamaica hospital in critical but stable condition, and the perpetrator was also hospitalized but was pronounced deceased on arrival. He said additional responding NYPD and EMS units arrived to assist with the transfer of the injured to hospital and continue the investigation. He said officers discovered a young girl, aged 11, laying in front of the house who died from her injuries (stab wounds). \\u201cThey were not able to enter the home because there was a fire inside the living room, the foyer area,\\u201d Maddrey said. \\u201cFDNY responded. They were able to put out the fire.\\u201d He said a 61-year-old woman found at the home was also removed to New York-Presbyterian Queens Hospital in critical condition. \\u201cOnce the fire was extinguished, and we were able to get into the apartment, we found another three victims, all dead,\\u201d Maddrey said, adding that so far, police believe all the victims died from stab wounds and that the investigation was ongoing. He said that the weapon used to injure the officers was a typical kitchen steak knife and was the only weapon recovered from the scene. He added that their investigation will determine if this was the same weapon that was used to injure all the victims. Kenny confirmed that the deceased perpetrator has been identified as Courtney Gordon, 38, from the Edenwald section of The Bronx. \\u201cHe has one prior arrest, and that was for a strangulation domestic violence incident that took place in The Bronx,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe has nothing any history or any contact with the police that bring us back to this location on Beach 22 Street. It seems he\\u2019s a Bronx resident that was visiting family members at this location.\\u201d Norwood News later followed up with the Bronx District Attorney\\u2019s Office to obtain details of the prior DV case. A representative for the DA replied, saying, \\u201cThe case is sealed.\\u201d It\\u2019s possible this is in order to protect the identity of the victim. We asked for the reason and will update this story upon receipt of any further information. Asked if police knew what triggered the rampage, Kenny said they just had the 911 caller who was at stationhouse being interviewed, and who they said may be able to shed some light on what occurred. The victims were only identified by their ages and gender i.e. a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, a man in his 30s found in the back bedrooms of the house, the 11-year-old girl who was found in front of location who police said was transported to Long Island Medical Center-Cohen, and the 61-year-old woman who was currently at Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition. Of the perpetrator, Kenny added, \\u201cIt seems that he lit the couch at the front of the location on fire as he was leaving.\\u201d Maddrey added that on arrival at the location, the officers had asked the perpetrator, \\u201cHey, did you hear anything? Do you know what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d He said the man sort of nodded before drawing his knife and immediately attacking both officers. Police thanked the doctors and staff of Jamaica Hospital for the care shown to the two officers who they said are expected to survive. \\u201cBut listen, these are two experienced police officers, a 28-year-veteran, a 16-year-veteran, working the midnight shift in the Rockaways,\\u201d Maddrey said. \\u201cI really have to commend them. They did an excellent job. You know, they could have easily let this person walk past him with his luggage. Instead they stopped, asked a couple of questions, tried to gain some intel before they walked right up in there. Unfortunately, they were met with the perpetrator in this incident. He went right at them.\\u201d Hendry also said the PBA was truly thankful to the hospital staff. \\u201cThis shows that police officers never know what they\\u2019re responding to, what\\u2019s awaiting for them on that scene,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis scene was chaos; multiple victims, a house on fire, and a madman on a rampage, on a mission, and thankful that these police officers showed up. Imagine what could have happened if these police officers weren\\u2019t there. This madman tried to kill, after he killed others, a New York City police officer.\\u201d Hendry continued, \\u201cThe skill that this police officer had, shooting and stopping the threat after he was being stabbed, unbelievable skill. I know both these police officers personally; an unbelievable job, true professionals, just great men who were doing their job, and again, thank God they were there. Those who say that police officers shouldn\\u2019t be out on our street. I say to them, thank God that these police officers responded. How many more victims could there have been if these skilled, professional police officers did not show up to this scene?\\u201d Local services for those affected by domestic or gender-based violence are available in The Bronx.

The suspect later identified as Francisco Javier Alba, 52, assaulted an employee inside the location and exited before walking across the street to the west sidewalk. Officers arrived at the location and spoke with the victim, who provided details of the incident, which described that a misdemeanor battery and vandalism occurred. The victim described Alba as the suspect but declined to make a private person\\u2019s arrest. Officers exited the business and returned to their police cruiser where they began to complete the associated crime reports, when Alba returned. He approached the officers while holding a drywall hammer with combined hatchet blade in his hand and appeared to be wearing numerous layers of clothing. Alba began arguing with the officers when they ordered him not to return to the business. The suspect walked across the street to the west sidewalk while becoming increasingly agitated. Officers requested an additional unit for a \\u201c415 man\\u201d and for approximately 30-35 minutes continued to order Alba to leave the area and drop the bladed hammer. Alba started crossing the street toward the officers with the hammer in his hand. Officers gave Alba numerous orders to stop, get out of the street and drop the hammer. He refused to comply with commands resulting in officers utilizing numerous less lethal munitions including a TASER, 40mm less-lethal-launchers and beanbag shotguns, which were ineffective. Alba continued to advance towards one officer, while still armed with the hammer in his hand stating, \\u201cShoot it, shoot it,\\u201d at which point an Officer-Involved Shooting occurred. He was struck by gunfire, fell to the ground and was taken into custody without further incident. Personnel from the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the scene and transported Alba by rescue ambulance to Holy Cross Medical Center where he was admitted for gunshot wounds and listed in stable condition. A drywall hammer with combined hatchet blade was recovered from the scene and booked as evidence. No officers or other community members were injured as a result of this incident. The LAPD\\u2019s specialized Force Investigation Division responded to the scene, interviewed witnesses, and supervised the collection of evidence by the Forensic Science Division personnel. The complete investigation will be reviewed by the Chief of Police, the Board of Police Commissioners, and the Office of the Inspector General to determine the thoroughness and accuracy of the investigation and whether the use of deadly force complied with LAPD\\u2019s policies and procedures.\",\n",

Footage released on Friday shows the terror that unfolded in the streets of Woodland Hills and Calabasas when a homeless man first attacked someone with a machete and then ran into a popular restaurant where he was fatally shot by police. The incident took place on Nov. 1 when 911 dispatchers received a call from a man who said he had been attacked by another man with a machete at the McDonald\\u2019s at Mulholland Drive near the 101 Freeway. \\u201cI was able to get away from him, and then he kept attacking me,\\u201d the victim told the 911 dispatcher. \\u201cWe need to get in control of these homeless people,\\u201d he added.

U.S. & World News from around the country and around the globe The 2017 podcast, which won a Peabody Award, told the story of an Alabama man named John B. McLemore, who died by suicide before the show came out. McLemore's use of an expletive to describe his hometown gives the podcast its abbreviated title. \\u201cS-Town\\u201d begins telling the story of a reputed killing and also another death and winds up focusing on the eccentric McLemore, a restorer of antique clocks, and his tortured relationship with the town of Woodstock.

      "                    \"snippet\": \"Backlash grows over police shooting of Israeli civilian after Jerusalem attack By Christian Edwards, Rob Picheta, Alex Marquardt and Lauren Izso, CNN (CNN) \\u2014 Friends and relatives gathered Monday to mourn the death of Yuval Castleman, the Israeli civilian who responded to a deadly terror attack in Jerusalem, shooting and killing the perpetrators before he himself was shot dead by an Israeli reservist soldier. Dozens traveled to Castleman\\u00e2s parents\\u00e2 home in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Tiv\\u00e2on to attend his shiva, the traditional seven-day Jewish mourning period, as anger has grown across the country at the circumstances leading to his death. Castleman, a former police officer, was driving to work Thursday when he saw two gunmen open fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem. Moments later, he had rushed to the scene. \\u00e2He saw the attack, and he just stopped his car, got out of his car, took his gun out, and he just charged at the terrorists and he killed them both,\\u00e2 Guy Itzkovich, Castleman\\u00e2s friend, told CNN at the shiva. A video showed two uniformed soldiers scrambling out of a red car and grabbing their guns. A third person, an army reservist according to Israel\\u00e2s military, appears to have mistaken\\u00c2 Castleman for an attacker\\u00c2 and\\u00c2 began shooting\\u00c2 at him.\\u00c2 Bullets from one of the Israeli soldiers may have also struck Castleman, the IDF said. \\u00e2When the soldiers saw him I\\u00e2m assuming they thought he was a terrorist. But then when Yuval realized that that\\u00e2s what they\\u00e2re thinking, he opened his jacket to show he had nothing underneath, and got down on his knees. He opened his hands, so they could see he had nothing in his hands,\\u00e2 said Itkovich. \\u00e2He was shouting in Hebrew. He was shouting \\u00e2I\\u00e2m an Israeli.\\u00e2 He threw his wallet, his identification, on the way so they could see he\\u00e2s an Israeli. And they just shot him. They gunned him down,\\u00e2 he said. Castleman died at the Shaare Zedek medical center later Thursday. Three other victims were killed in the attack, for which Hamas claimed responsibility. At Castleman\\u00e2s shiva Monday, his father Moshe praised his \\u00e2heroic\\u00e2 son. \\u00e2Yuval did what he was expected to do\\u00c2 because all his life he was that sort of person,\\u00e2 he told CNN. \\u00e2He was trained in the security environment and he did what was requested of him because it\\u00e2s decreed that we have to help one another.\\u00e2 Moshe said there should be an investigation into his son\\u00e2s fatal shooting \\u00e2to prevent such a thing happening again.\\u00e2 Itzkovich, who served in the police alongside Castleman, accused the soldier who shot him of violating protocols. \\u00e2There\\u00e2s certain things that you\\u00e2re not supposed to do. Even if Yuval was a terrorist \\u00e2 even if the citizen that they thought was a terrorist was a terrorist \\u00e2 the man had surrendered,\\u00e2 Itzkovich said. \\u00e2By these protocols, they\\u00e2re supposed to arrest him. He should never have been shot.\\u00e2 Itzkovich expressed his disbelief that the soldier had \\u00e2ignored\\u00e2 the protocols he said are drilled into those serving in the Israeli police and military. \\u00e2They taught us in the army, and in the police force, that the protocols are very, very strict. It\\u00e2s like a mantra,\\u00e2 he said. \\u00e2If you wake me up at 4 in the morning, I will tell you exactly what those protocols are. I trust the army, and I trust the police force, and I know that they gave the orders exactly as they gave it to me, when I was there. And this guy, this soldier \\u00e2 he ignored them. It\\u00e2s not that he didn\\u00e2t know them, he just ignored them. And that was what my friend got killed for. It\\u00e2s devastating.\\u00e2 The IDF originally said it would not investigate the incident. But, amid widespread media coverage of Castleman\\u00e2s death, Israel Police said they would investigate it, and the IDF then said it would join the investigation because the suspect in the killing is a soldier. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said he felt \\u00e2deep sorrow\\u00e2 for Castleman\\u00e2s \\u00e2tragic death.\\u00e2 \\u00e2The IDF has clear instructions on how and when to shoot, and all of this is very clear. And there\\u00e2s a clear moral rule \\u2013 when someone puts their hand up \\u2013 he should not be shot,\\u00e2 he also said, cautioning that \\u00e2until the investigation is not over, we cannot indict a person. We have to wait for its outcomes.\\u00e2 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called for a \\u00e2thorough inquiry\\u00e2 into the shooting, describing Castleman as \\u00e2a hero of Israel.\\u00e2 But that call followed an earlier statement by Netanyahu that prompted fury in parts of Israel. In a widely panned comment on the incident, Netanyahu defended the right for Israeli citizens to bear arms and suggested that some civilian deaths were the \\u00e2price\\u00e2 that came with such a policy. \\u00e2That\\u00e2s life,\\u00e2 he said. \\u00e2We know that during upticks of terror over the past decade, and even before that, having armed civilians often saved lives and prevented a bigger catastrophe,\\u00e2 Netanyahu said in a press conference to Tel Aviv on Saturday night. \\u00e2Under the current circumstances, we should continue with this policy, I surely support it. We might have to pay prices, but that\\u00e2s life.\\u00e2 Asked for his response to Netanyahu\\u00e2s comments, Castleman\\u00e2s father said he would not discuss them \\u00e2because the Prime Minister spoke later and corrected what he had said, and after he understood what had happened, he said that my son was a hero \\u00e2 and that\\u00e2s exactly how it was.\\u00e2 Applications to carry private\\u00c2 firearms in Israel surged in the month following the Hamas attack on October 7, according to the Ministry of National Security. As of October 30, the ministry had received 180,500 new applications with its centers receiving an average of 10,000 new requests per day \\u00e2 compared to 850 new requests per week prior to the terror attacks. Israel\\u00e2s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir has voiced his desire for more\\u00c2 Israelis\\u00c2 to carry\\u00c2 firearms.

After a brief encounter with the patrolmen, Gordon drew a knife, stabbing one officer in the neck and chest area, according to police. In response to the attack, one of the officers used his firearm to end the carnage. \\u00e2He strikes the second officer in the head,\\u00e2 said Maddrey. \\u00e2Our 28-year veteran is able to draw his firearm, he\\u00e2s able to discharge his weapon to stop the assault and he was able to stop the perpetrator.\\u00e2 Upon entering the home, the officers found a 12-year-old boy, 44-year-old woman, and a man in his 30s dead inside the residence.

A 61-year-old woman at the home also suffered multiple stab wounds. She\\u00e2s currently at an area hospital, officials said. According to police, after stabbing his relatives, Gordon lit the couch on fire as he made his escape. The two officers and Gordon were removed to local area hospitals. The suspect was pronounced dead on arrival, authorities said. He had been previously arrested in the Bronx for strangulation in a domestic violence incident, officials said. Gordan was a visitor to the home, not a resident, police said. The injured two police officers are expected to make a full recovery.

According to a statement from the San Antonio Police Department, officers attempted to stop a vehicle on the frontage road of I-35 near Somerset Road on the Southeast Side of San Antonio around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday because they had reason to believe Trevi\\u00f1o was in the vehicle.

Lamar Deshawn Young, 33, was killed after police say he fired at them when they attempted to arrest him, according to a spokesperson for the Cabarrus County Sheriff\\u2019s Office. Police attempted to Young at a location in the 3100 block of Bellwood Place, where he allegedly believed he was meeting a 15-year-old female for sex. Upon the suspect entering the home, officers reportedly attempted to place him in custody. Reports indicated that he resisted arrest, leading to him allegedly drawing a weapon and firing at the officers. Young had been released from federal prison in January and was required to wear a GPS ankle monitor at the time of the shooting, according to the spokesperson. According to the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections, Young had previously served time for manslaughter and a drug-related charge. The manslaughter charges relate to a shooting in 2009 that left a man dead in Concord. The shooting is being investigated by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation to ensure all polices and procedures were correctly followed. All officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with policy for both the sheriff\\u2019s office and police department for all officer-involved shooting incidents, according to the release.
