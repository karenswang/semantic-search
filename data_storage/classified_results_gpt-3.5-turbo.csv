Just before 8 p.m. Oct. 1, officers were called to the 1400 block of 116th Avenue about a man throwing things off a balcony and damaging cars in the parking lot, according to a news release from the Westminster Police Department.
When the first officer, identified in the news release as Officer Robb Phelps, arrived, three apartment residents had a man pinned to the ground, and a fourth resident told the officer the man was screaming and hitting walls, the footage shows.
The officer asked the man to lay down on his stomach with his hands out and began reaching for his Taser, then the footage shows the man reached into his pocket and grabbed a gun.
Phelps tased the man and yelled for him to drop the gun. One of the residents can also be seen appearing to try and wrestle the gun out of the man’s hand.
The officer continued yelling commands at the man and asked the resident to move away from the man. The man appeared to point the gun at the resident during the struggle.
Phelps then fired one round that hit the man, and the resident got the gun out of the man’s hand and threw it on the ground, the footage shows.
The man then fell over onto the ground, and a second officer who arrived later at the scene attempted life-saving measures on the man a couple of minutes later.
Phelps told another officer the resident trying to get the gun out of the man’s hand “appeared in danger” when the officer fired his weapon, according to the footage.
According to the news release, the man was taken to the hospital where he died.
Phelps is on administrative leave and the incident is being investigated by the 17th Judicial Critical Incident Response Team, which will likely take several months, according to the police department. The Adams County coroner will release the man’s identity.

BISMARCK, N.D. â Police shot and killed a 17-year-old early Sunday during a traffic stop in a mall parking lot in Bismarck, North Dakota, while investigating the teen in connection with a reported shooting.
Police responded about 12:15 a.m. Sunday to gunfire in the area, according to a news release. Officers determined a shooting occurred near a hotel. Police subsequently began investigating 17-year-old Nicholas Bruington, of Bismarck, as the prime suspect, according to Lt. Luke Gardiner.
About 1:50 a.m., officers stopped a vehicle in which Bruington was a passenger, near the Scheels sporting goods store in the Kirkwood Mall parking lot. Police said Bruington âhad a firearm and did not follow commands.â
It wasn't immediately clear whether Bruington pointed the gun at police. None of the officers were injured.
Three officers shot at Bruington. Officers performed life-saving procedures until Bruington was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting, per the police department's protocol. The three officers are on administrative leave, pending the probe. The news release did not identify them.
Bruington was suspected of shooting at another juvenile, who police say was not injured.
Bruington attended high school in Bismarck for a week or less at some point last year, but he was not enrolled in the public school district for the current year, Bismarck Public Schools spokesman Steve Koontz told The Associated Press. The district is prepared to offer support for students, if needed, in the wake of Bruington's death, Koontz said.
Squad cars and body cameras recorded video, Gardiner said. He didn't say whether the cameras captured the events of the shooting. He referred queries to the bureau.
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, whose office oversees the bureau, did not immediately respond to a text message for questions about the shooting. The Associated Press was not able to leave a voice message due to his mailbox being full.
The last fatal police shooting in Bismarck was in January 2020, Gardiner said.
Earlier this year, a Fargo police officer shot and killed a gunman who had opened fire on other officers and a bystander as police responded to a routine crash along a busy street.

One of them who said he witnessed the shooting in the Millhill neighborhood described watching Jessup flee police while gripping his pants and a backpack, then falling amid rapid gunfire.
Neighbors, meanwhile, questioned whether the fatal police foot chase was necessary and lamented the tense relationship between residents and police officers who patrol the neighborhood seeking guns.
In an interview, Mike Davis, 28, asked why so many officers couldn’t arrest Jessup without killing him, and said police should stop engaging in foot pursuits just to get guns off the streets.
“If we got guns on us and we running from you, don’t chase us and shoot us just for all that,” said Davis, who said he heard 10 to 15 shots Tuesday from inside his home on Wilkens Avenue. “If we know running away is not going to help us, we’re going to shoot” officers.
Police have said multiple officers fired at a man who pointed a gun at them as he ran from them.
Authorities have not identified the individual who was pronounced dead at University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, but police said Tuesday they believed he was an adult. Two of his brothers identified him as Hunter Jessup, who neighbors said lived in the 2700 block of Wilkens Avenue with his girlfriend.
Police Commissioner Richard Worley said police recovered a handgun with an extended magazine from the scene.
On Wednesday afternoon, blood stained the sidewalk in the 2600 block of Wilkens Avenue, in what is Baltimore’s longest unbroken row of townhomes. A broken window and a twisted railing that appeared to have been hit by a bullet were visible in the middle of the nearly treeless block.
Friends and his brothers remembered Jessup as a giving person who kept to himself.
Amare, a 14-year-old neighbor whose mother asked that he be identified only by his first name, said Jessup was “always goofy.”
“We was always sitting right there, goofing around, listening to music everyday,” Amare said. “This one day, police took him from me.”
Southwest District Action Team officers initially tried to stop Jessup near the corner of Brunswick and St. Benedict streets because they believed he had a gun, Worley said Tuesday. The commissioner said there had been “several shootings” in the area and officers were doing a “proactive patrol.”
The city’s crime map shows the Millhill neighborhood has seen one aggravated assault and some burglary and larceny offenses in the past 28 days, but no homicides or attempted murders. It lists three shootings in the past year.
Since the July 9 police redistricting, the Southwestern District has experienced eight homicides and 31 nonfatal shootings, as of Nov. 4. The city overall is seeing a decline in homicides and nonfatal shootings this year — 228 homicides, as of Wednesday, compared to 289 at the same time in 2022; and 557 nonfatal shootings so far, compared to 619 last year.
Police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said in an email Wednesday that there have been 146 gun arrests in the Southwest District as of Nov. 5, up 5% compared to the same time last year.
Earlier this year, a District Action Team member shot and wounded a 17-year-old in nearby Shipley Hill. The teams are specialized squads that a district commander can direct toward patrol needs or violent crime arrests. They also play a role in the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy, an initiative geared toward dismantling groups behind the city’s shootings.
Eldridge said Wednesday that officers who pursued Jessup were on routine patrol, unrelated to the Group Violence Reduction Strategy.
Some have suggested District Actions Teams are a rebranding of the department’s past controversial flex squads. Critics say it’s important to scrutinize both the work of the teams and the selection of members.
Similar to Tuesday’s Millhill shooting, the officer in the Shipley Hill police shooting approached an individual, suspecting he was armed. That teen also fled. In Shipley Hill, Officer Cedric Elleby could be heard in body camera footage ordering the teen to drop his weapon, before then shooting the teen from behind.
Worley said Tuesday that officers also warned Jessup to drop his weapon before firing.
In late June, Baltimore Police officers shot and killed a 40-year-old Baltimore man in East Baltimore on June 29. Two of the five officers who fired their weapons in the shooting were Southeast District officers, while two were assigned to the Eastern District Action Team, according to the Attorney General’s Office. The fifth was part of a Southeast/East Side Initiative, the office said in a news release.
Body camera footage in that shooting showed Darryl Gamble, who was wanted by police, shoot at officers before they returned fire. The five officers fired about 40 rounds, police have said. Roughly 33 casings from Gamble’s weapons were recovered, police said in July.
Tuesday’s shooting was captured on body camera, officials said. It likely will be released publicly in coming days.

D, an 18-year-old who asked to be identified by his nickname for safety reasons, said members of the District Action Teams harass him and his friends.
“We’re being children, we’re being kids,” he said. “Kids gonna be outside.”
Breaking News Alerts
Worley said Tuesday that Jessup drew a gun before an officer tackled him. He pointed his weapon at police before multiple officers fired at him, then immediately rendered aid, Worley said.
Tuesday’s police shooting will be the first investigated by the Office of Attorney General’s Independent Investigations Division since the office’s prosecutors were granted authority to bring criminal charges against officers in police-involved civilian fatalities.
The Maryland General Assembly earlier this year granted the Attorney General prosecutorial power in those cases, which can include in-custody deaths, police shootings and fatalities following police pursuits. It marked a shift from recent years when those investigations were handed over to local prosecutors for final determinations. The law change went into effect Oct. 1.
The attorney general recently hired a deputy chief of litigation and is currently in the process of hiring an additional prosecutor and a paralegal evidence/analyst, spokesperson Thomas Lester said in an email to The Baltimore Sun. Going forward, the unit will no longer forward its investigative report to local prosecutors but instead announce its own decision.",Y

BALTIMORE â Baltimore police officers shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them following a foot pursuit Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed.
Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said.
One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasnât the case, Worley said.
Officials havenât determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also havenât determined whether the armed man fired his handgun.
The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasnât been released.
The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Departmentâs specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they donât wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said.
The teams drew scrutiny earlier this year after a police shooting that unfolded under similar circumstances and left a teen in critical condition â less than a mile from the scene of Tuesdayâs shooting. In that case, too, officers tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was carrying a gun. He ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind.
In this case as in the previous shooting, Worley defended the officersâ actions. He said they were conducting âproactive patrolsâ aimed at preventing violence. He also said they yelled at the man multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire.
âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said during a news conference at the scene. âWe donât know what he was up to with that weapon.â
Department policy says officers are allowed to use deadly force when they believe itâs âimmediately necessaryâ to protect another officer or civilian from âimminent danger of death or serious physical injury.â In the case of a fleeing suspect, officers can use deadly force to prevent the person from escaping under certain circumstances.
âWhile we are very early in this investigation, we know that incidents like this really pull the heart out of the community,â said Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, thanking city police officers for what they do.
But praise for the cityâs police department has been hard to come by in recent years.

Baltimore police officers shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them following a foot pursuit Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed.
Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said.
One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasnât the case, Worley said.
Officials havenât determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also havenât determined whether the armed man fired his handgun.
The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasnât been released.
The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Departmentâs specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they donât wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said.
The teams drew scrutiny earlier this year after a police shooting that unfolded under similar circumstances and left a teen in critical condition â less than a mile from the scene of Tuesdayâs shooting. In that case, too, officers tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was carrying a gun. He ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind.
In this case as in the previous shooting, Worley defended the officersâ actions. He said they were conducting âproactive patrolsâ aimed at preventing violence. He also said they yelled at the man multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire.
âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said during a news conference at the scene. âWe donât know what he was up to with that weapon.â
Department policy says officers are allowed to use deadly force when they believe itâs âimmediately necessaryâ to protect another officer or civilian from âimminent danger of death or serious physical injury.â In the case of a fleeing suspect, officers can use deadly force to prevent the person from escaping under certain circumstances.
âWhile we are very early in this investigation, we know that incidents like this really pull the heart out of the community,â said Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, thanking city police officers for what they do.
But praise for the cityâs police department has been hard to come by in recent years. The agency has implemented significant reform measures under a federal consent decree established in 2017 that mandates a series of court-ordered changes to eliminate unconstitutional policing practices and improve community trust. The agreement was reached after the U.S. Justice Department discovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing.

The officer was reporting to his 4 a.m. shift at Oakland City Hall when he ""was confronted by an armed individual who opened fire,"" according to the Oakland Police Officers' Association. The officer fired his gun and shot the person, the association said in an emailed statement.
Gunfire related to the confrontation activated ShotSpotter, a device designed to detect gunfire, and additional officers responded to the scene, according to a statement from the Oakland Police Department. Medical aid was administered to the person with gunshot wounds, but the individual was declared deceased at the scene.
While the police officers' association shared some of the circumstances of the shooting, the Oakland Police Department released few details in a press conference this morning.

An unknown number of officers were in the area of 7th and Grayson Streets around 5:25 a.m. investigating a suspected vehicle burglary in progress when they encountered three adult suspects, police said while speaking to reporters Monday.
Officers eventually opened fire on the suspects, hitting one person, according to authorities. After life-saving measures were attempted, the person was later pronounced dead at Highland Hospital.
Police did not reveal whether the suspects fired any shots in the exchange, or whether they were armed with a weapon, citing an open investigation into the incident. When asked why the officers felt the need to open fire, a police spokesperson said she didn’t have that information.
At the scene, a Ford truck was seen adjacent to a police vehicle with at least one bullet hole in the driver’s side window. Two arrests were made at the scene and no officers were injured, according to authorities.
Authorities did not immediately release the identity of the person killed.
In September, five Berkeley officers fatally shot 24-year-old Lamar Walker after he killed the mother of his 7-year-old child, before an apparent attempt to take his own life at the Toyota of Berkeley Service Center in just over the city border in Albany. When police found him, he allegedly pointed a revolver at officers before they opened fire.",Y
