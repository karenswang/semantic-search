Just before 8 p.m. Oct. 1, officers were called to the 1400 block of 116th Avenue about a man throwing things off a balcony and damaging cars in the parking lot, according to a news release from the Westminster Police Department. When the first officer, identified in the news release as Officer Robb Phelps, arrived, three apartment residents had a man pinned to the ground, and a fourth resident told the officer the man was screaming and hitting walls, the footage shows. The officer asked the man to lay down on his stomach with his hands out and began reaching for his Taser, then the footage shows the man reached into his pocket and grabbed a gun. Phelps tased the man and yelled for him to drop the gun. One of the residents can also be seen appearing to try and wrestle the gun out of the man’s hand. The officer continued yelling commands at the man and asked the resident to move away from the man. The man appeared to point the gun at the resident during the struggle. Phelps then fired one round that hit the man, and the resident got the gun out of the man’s hand and threw it on the ground, the footage shows. The man then fell over onto the ground, and a second officer who arrived later at the scene attempted life-saving measures on the man a couple of minutes later. Phelps told another officer the resident trying to get the gun out of the man’s hand “appeared in danger” when the officer fired his weapon, according to the footage. According to the news release, the man was taken to the hospital where he died. Phelps is on administrative leave and the incident is being investigated by the 17th Judicial Critical Incident Response Team, which will likely take several months, according to the police department. The Adams County coroner will release the man’s identity. Sign up to get crime news sent straight to your inbox each day."

It points to a major issue concerning rampant crime and murder in the city. The reporter quotes a citizen interviewed concerning an individual who was shot by police while running away and carrying a firearm, who said, “If we got guns and we are running from you, don’t chase us and shoot us just for all that.” Excuse me? It should be perfectly OK for citizens to openly carry guns and run away from police? This entitled way of thinking surely leads to the kind of crime we see in the city.

"‘Take care of each other,’ says father of WMU student who died at frat house",2023-11-15,2023-11-16T02:09:54Z,en,mlive.com,https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2023/11/take-care-of-each-other-says-father-of-wmu-student-who-died-at-frat-house.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231116020954id_/https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2023/11/take-care-of-each-other-says-father-of-wmu-student-who-died-at-frat-house.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231116020954/https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2023/11/take-care-of-each-other-says-father-of-wmu-student-who-died-at-frat-house.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1saXZlKS9uZXdzL2thbGFtYXpvby8yMDIzLzExL3Rha2UtY2FyZS1vZi1lYWNoLW90aGVyLXNheXMtZmF0aGVyLW9mLXdtdS1zdHVkZW50LXdoby1kaWVkLWF0LWZyYXQtaG91c2UuaHRtbA~~,"KALAMAZOO, MI -- James “Jimmy” Wettlaufer was known for wearing pink Crocs. Pink Croc sales were likely up last month, according to his father, John Wettlaufer. Dozens of fraternity brothers and others bought them to wear for the younger Wettlaufer’s funeral in October, John Wettlaufer told MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette. People shared stories of the WMU student who died recently as a nice guy with a great sense of humor, athletic skills and musical talent. Wettlaufer, 19, a sophomore studying finance at Western Michigan University, had a bright future ahead of him. Wettlaufer was found dead Saturday, Sept. 30, outside the fraternity where he lived, 1714 Fraternity Village Drive. The Pi Kappa Alpha’s Epsilon Psi house is not far from WMU’s main campus in Kalamazoo. An autopsy report describes Wettlaufer’s death as an accident caused by the combined toxic effects of ethanol (alcohol) and cocaine. The elder Wettlaufer, 55, doesn’t point fingers for what happened to his son, he said in an interview with MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette on Nov. 10. “If you were ever in college and you saw somebody that maybe drank too much and he’s just sleeping it off, you just say, ‘Oh my gosh, he’s loaded,’” Wettlaufer said, speaking through emotions after losing his son. “So I can’t blame the guys. They didn’t know. And I don’t think anybody found him until it was too late.” Jimmy Wettlaufer had a standing Facetime call with his parents. The last one, the Sunday before his death, he talked about typical college things. He was thinking of switching a class he felt he could be more successful in, talked about fraternity activities and said the pledge class was going to be really large. They texted, like they normally do, on the night before his death. Student found dead outside A fraternity member and resident found Wettlaufer laying alongside a wooden railing of the balcony about 8:45 a.m. on Sept. 30 and called police, the police report says. An officer woke up another fraternity resident to ask for security camera footage. But the camera overlooking the outdoor balcony was without a battery at the time of the death. That person told the officer he had a Snapchat message from Wettlaufer and opened it. The report states, “He then began showing off a handle of a clear intoxicant and stated something to the effect of, ‘If I don`t get up, this is why, you have permission to shake me awake if you need to.’ Wettlaufer appeared happy and in good spirits as he jokingly stated this to the camera.” “He then spent several moments binge drinking the alcohol until the container was completely empty,” the police report states. Witnesses told police the message was sent to a group chat for all fraternity members, the police report says, and it was not part of his Snapchat “story.” The officer recorded the video on his body camera, as it was expected the video would automatically be deleted from Snapchat. Wettlaufer’s message was sent at 3:36 a.m., according to other people interviewed by police. The police report does not detail how many people saw the message, or when. A man and woman told police they both spoke to Wettlaufer around 3 a.m., before they went to bed, and he told them he was going outside to sit on the balcony and listen to music. The woman told police Wettlaufer promised to stop drinking, and the bottle of vodka he was drinking still had some shots left in it. Two samples from after his death showed a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.544% and 0.447%, the report states. With a BAC of greater than 0.4%, patients can develop respiratory depression followed by coma or death. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%, while people are considered “super drunk” when above 0.17%. Alcohol in the form of ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) is found in alcoholic beverages. Ethyl alcohol poisoning generally comes from drinking too much alcohol over a short time period, the Mayo Clinic says. Cocaine showed up in his blood in the amount of 50.2 nanograms per milliliter, just above the test detection limit of 50 nanograms per milliliter. Based on conversations with the medical examiner’s office, Wettlaufer said he doesn’t believe cocaine had as much to do with his son’s death as the alcohol. He also believes there wasn’t enough cash going out of his accounts for cocaine usage to have been a long-term problem for his son. Hard liquor prohibited Wettlaufer graduated from Nequa Valley High School in Illinois in 2022 with a scholar designation. After high school, he moved to Kalamazoo for college and joined a fraternity. The Kalamazoo chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha could not be reached for comment. The group’s national headquarters did not respond to a request for comment. A man who answered the door at the fraternity house on Monday said he was advised to politely say no comment, when asked about Wettlaufer. The fraternity’s website offers guidance to its members on issues including drinking, with a rule banning liquor with alcohol content of above 15% on premises. “The chapter or members shall not permit, encourage, coerce, glorify or participate in any activities involving the rapid consumption of alcohol, such as drinking games,” the national organization’s website says. The Western Michigan University Interfraternity Council, which Pi Kappa Alpha is a member of, also bans drinks above 15% alcohol by volume on its premises. Wettlaufer had a history of alcohol use disorder, the autopsy says. It is a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use, despite adverse social, occupational or health consequences. Nearly 29 million adults (11.3% of adults) had alcohol use disorder in 2021. A bright and accomplished student Wettlaufer’s obituary states he had been on the honor roll at WMU. He was also a second-degree black belt, an exercise enthusiast and a bicyclist, his obituary states. He had just obtained an internship, the police report says. The fraternity posted a memorial message highlighting his life, and said Wettlaufer will be remembered as an exceptional leader and a shining precedent for its members. “Jim will forever be remembered for the little things, such as his love for music, playing guitar or making everyone laugh at a moment’s notice,” the group posted on Facebook Monday, Oct. 2. Family members cherished the time they spent with him, the obit states. “The absence of Jimmy’s radiant presence is deeply felt, but the love, laughter and memories he shared will forever echo in our hearts,” the obituary says. “Rest in peace, dear Jimmy.” It’s tragic when a student’s life ends short, said Reetha Raveendran, WMU associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students. “This is a painful loss for his family, but also for his peers and other members of our campus,” Raveendran said in a statement on behalf of the university. “For those who are left behind, we care for them through the mental health services available to our community, and we have a point person in the dean of students’ office who stays in touch with peers who are directly impacted.” WMU offers resources for students related to substance use and abuse. The university’s website advises people to seek substance abuse counseling if students are experiencing chronic hangovers, having difficulty studying, blacking out from drinking or concerned about a friend’s substance use, among other reasons. WMU’s Office of Student Engagement provides education programming to fraternities and sororities about harmful or risky behavior, including substance use, the university said. The WMU Department of Public Safety also has alcohol awareness and safety programs. The university has a bystander intervention program to train students how to intervene when they see high-risk drinking and other harmful behaviors, and another system to report concerns about another student’s welfare. ‘I don’t blame them at all’ As loved ones gathered for Jimmy Wettlaufer’s funeral the week after his death, about 90 fraternity brothers attended the ceremony in Illinois, John Wettlaufer said. He and others have asked themselves over and over again about what someone could have done differently. It happened in the middle of the night, he said, and nobody was around. “The takeaway I had for the boys was, ‘Take care of each other,’” Wettlaufer said. “If something doesn’t look right, don’t say, ‘Oh, it’ll be OK.’ Don’t brush it under the rug.” He spoke the message to the roomful of fraternity brothers and others attending his son’s funeral. “I don’t blame them at all, and there is nothing to blame,” Wettlaufer said. “This wasn’t a drinking game ... or any of that.” The tragedy came as a surprise. His son was often the voice of reason to others, Wettlaufer said. People on his tribute wall commented on his “bright” and “positive” personality. “Take care of each other,” Wettlaufer said again, remembering what he said in a speech at the funeral. “These are all your friends.” Sometimes, young people don’t want to get involved because they think they might get in trouble, he said. “If it doesn’t look right, say something to somebody,” Wettlaufer said. It is a huge loss, the elder Wettlaufer said. He knows they’ll never get the answers they are seeking. For most people, their bad experience with alcohol ends with waking up sick the next morning. “Unfortunately that didn’t happen for my son,” Wettlaufer said. “And we lost a great kid.” Most Popular Stories by Brad Devereaux - Amazon announces its first Michigan solar farm project - ‘Take care of each other,’ says father of WMU student who died at frat house - Police identify 2 killed in Kalamazoo County crash, share details on incident - ‘Officer-involved shooting’ reported in Southwest Michigan - Shooting under investigation in Kalamazoo"

Three-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in 2024 will face the winner of the Republican primary, state Sen. Matt Dolan, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose or businessman Bernie Moreno, all of whom are anti-abortion. LaRose and Moreno have called for national legislation banning abortion at 15 weeks, while Dolan said he might consider federal legislation if enough states pass Issue 1-type measures. Issue 1 in Ohio last week showed signs of broad political support for abortion rights, winning in 18 counties where ex-President Donald Trump won in 2020. Those include some formerly reliably Democratic counties in Northeast Ohio that have drifted toward Republicans in the Trump era. The key, writes Andrew Tobias, is the extent to which Ohio voters support the Democratic position on issues like abortion or marijuana legalization, while supporting Republicans on other issues, like immigration or government spending. - Laura Overnight Scores and Weather Northeast Ohio weather forecast: More sun and mild temperatures Top stories Senate race: The Issue 1 election results foreshadow the case Democrats can make for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown next year as the bulwark against GOP efforts to impose some kind of national abortion ban. The U.S. Senate is closely divided in favor of Democrats and Brownâs seat will be among the handful of most hotly contested races, reports Andrew Tobias. Recreational marijuana: Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens indicatedÂ Tuesday that heâsÂ in no rush to pass major changes to the stateâs new recreational marijuana legalization law, parts of which take effect next month. Jeremy Pelzer reports that the only part of the new law, passed by voters last week, that takes effect on Dec. 7 is allowing Ohioans age 21 or older to grow up to six marijuana plants in their home (or up to 12 plants if at least two adults live in the home). Today in Ohio: The campaign to increase Cuyahoga Countyâs cigarette tax for the arts is on hold at a critical moment because ofÂ rising community discontentÂ over the public agency charged with distributing more than $11 million a year in revenues.Â WeâreÂ talking about the infighting among Cuyahoga Arts & Culture on Today in Ohio, cleveland.comâsÂ daily half-hour podcast. Statehouse and Politics Power separation: A pair of top Ohio Republicans are throwing cold water on some GOP lawmakersâ hopes to pass legislation stripping Ohio judges of the power to rule on the stateâs new abortion-rights amendment. Jeremy Pelzer reports that Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens said Tuesday that he does not consider the proposal, which would directly challenge the traditional separation of powers between the stateâs legislative and judicial branches, to be serious legislation. Recreational marijuana: All but one place in Cuyahoga County voted yes to legalize adult-use marijuana in Ohio, according to unofficial election results, reports Zachary Smith. The smallest support was in Linndale, where 48% of voters supported legalization. However, with only 25 total voters on the issue, that only amounted to 12 yes votes and 13 no votes. Tax credit: An Ohio Senate committee is considering a bill that would give individuals and businesses a tax credit for donations to crisis pregnancy centers â a week after a majority of Ohio voters decided to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Laura Hancock reports thatÂ Senate Bill 159 would cost the state between $3 million and $10 million a year. Death penalty: The families of murder victims are pushing Ohio lawmakers to end the death penalty. They continue to fight executions in Ohio, saying the appeals process makes the cases agonizing for family members, reports Molly Walsh. Diabetes month:Â U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown and a group of her Congressional Black Caucus colleagues on MondayÂ marked National Diabetes Month by highlighting how the disease disproportionately affects Black Americans and calling for greater action to help reduce diabeticsâ medical costs. Sabrina Eaton reports that Brown, a Warrensville Heights Democrat, said that that while diabetes is a universal problem, Black Americans are 60% more likely than white Americans to have diabetes. Northeast Ohio News CLE Ballet: The Cleveland Ballet Board of Directors has temporarily suspended the organizationâs President and CEO Michael Krasnyansky and the Artistic Director Gladisa Guadalupe amid an investigation into âserious workplace allegationsâ at the non-profit dance company, according to a news release from the Cleveland Ballet. Paris Wolfe reports the two are husband and wife. Peopleâs budget:Â Issue 38, Clevelandâs Peopleâs Budget charter amendment, was a tight race, but the ânoâ side -- backed by City Council and labor unions -- eked out a narrow victory. Courtney Astolfi and Zachary Smith report that precinct-level results show a similarly tight race in many of the cityâs neighborhoods, but some clear voting patterns emerged. Levy request: Cuyahoga County voters are all but certain to have the option to renew the countyâs 4.8-mill Health and Human Services levy when they cast ballots in March. The levy funds the countyâs social safety net, subsidizing dozens of departments and programs throughout the county, Lucas Daprile reports. Park burn:Â Plans to conductÂ controlled burns at three locations in the Cuyahoga Valley National ParkÂ have been scrubbed because workers assigned to carry out the prescribed fires have been pulled away on an emergency, reports Peter Krouse. Calling all artists: Cuyahoga County wants to hear your ideas about how the lower level of the Veterans Memorial Bridge could be used for âan innovative and immersive public experienceâ in June, Steven Litt reports. The artist or group that submits the winning proposal will receive $50,000 to make the vision a reality. Leaf blowers: A grassroots organization in Cleveland Heights that calls itselfÂ Quiet Clean HeightsÂ is hoping to silence one of the most pervasive sounds of fall: the grinding growl of the gas-powered leaf blower.Â The loosely organized group is part of theÂ Quiet Clean Alliance, made up of similarly motivated groups concerned about the noise, healthÂ and environmental impacts of gas-powered leaf blowers, reports Peter Krouse.

Russell called police at 12:55 p.m. Tuesday asking for the suicide hotline, police said. He hung up the phone as dispatchers began asking follow-up questions. Police tracked the location of the call to a home in the 6200 block of Hathaway Road. Upon arrival, officers said Russellâs wife answered the door and said her husband was in the basement alone. Officers found Russell, 67, sitting on a couch with a firearm in his hand threatening to commit suicide, police said. âOfficers on scene requested additional resources to be dispatched, including crisis intervention negotiators and medical personnel,â police said Wednesday in a Facebook post. âOfficers spoke with the male for about 10 minutes trying to convince him to put the gun down.â Police said Russell then pointed the gun at the officers, prompting them to fire their weapons. Russell was transported to Marymount Hospital, where he died. No officers sustained injuries. The two officers who fired their weapons were placed on paid administrative leave.

Good Samaritan John Lally told local Fox affiliate KRIV that he pulled up to a crash site on Highway 59 in order to help any accident victims, but he soon realized he walked into a gunfight between a lawman and a car thief. Houston police said Officer J. Gibson was shot in the leg Saturday while approaching the suspect, who crashed the stolen car while being chased by police. “That’s when I grabbed that cop by his vest and dragged him all the way back to my work truck,” Mr. Lally told KRIV. Mr. Lally sat with Officer Gibson while a tourniquet was wrapped around his wound. Authorities said the 19-year-old suspect hopped into another car and tried to get into a second vehicle, but eventually was shot by police multiple times. The suspect later died at a hospital. Police said Officer Gibson is expected to fully recover. • Matt Delaney can be reached at mdelaney@washingtontimes.com. Copyright © 2023 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

The plea agreement for Ryan, who retired as corrections director in September 2019, calls for a sentence of probation and an $8,500 payment to cover the Tempe Police Department's costs in conducting the investigation. The offense carries a maximum sentence of up to two years in prison. Sentencing is set for Jan. 11. Police were called to the house on Jan. 6, 2022, on a report that Ryan had shot himself in the hand. It was later revealed by police that the hand injury was caused by a less-than-lethal projectile shot by police after Ryan pointed a handgun at officers. They say the projectile was found during surgery. Ryan also was injured when he fired his gun before police arrived. He apparently suffered a cut to the forehead after a bullet hit a bathroom sink and sent a splinter of porcelain flying.

Police say Ryan slurred his words and was antagonistic toward a police negotiator, did not know why officers were at his home, or know what happened to his injured hand. Ryan also told police he didn’t remember pointing a gun at officers and acknowledged drinking tequila that evening, though he said he had just two shots. Outside of court, Ryan declined to comment on his plea. Craig Penrod, attorney for Ryan, told the judge during the hearing that the no-contest plea was in the public’s best interest. “He has no specific recollection of the events,” Penrod said.

Police said Ryan told hospital staff that the cut was the result of an earlier fall, though the injury looked fresh. Ryan was never booked into jail after eventually surrendering to police and being taken to the hospital. Officers seized about 15 guns from his home. Ryan’s tenure as corrections director was controversial. A federal magistrate judge found him in contempt of court for not following through on promises in a legal settlement to improve health care for prisoners. He was previously criticized after the 2009 heat-related death of a prisoner who was left for nearly four hours in an unshaded outdoor holding cell during triple-digit heat. Advertisement Article continues below this ad About five years later, prison officials were accused of botching the execution of Joseph Wood, who was given 15 doses of a two-drug combination over nearly two hours. Ryan also came under criticism in 2014 by a prison teacher who was raped after being left alone with a prisoner who was a sex offender. The teacher said Ryan allowed lax training, staffing shortages and poor security at the prison. Later in Ryan's tenure, the corrections department was rocked by revelations that prisoners at the Lewis prison complex west of Phoenix were able to open their locked cell doors and attack corrections officers and other prisoners."

Mr. Jones was killed in 2013 by five officers as he lay motionless on the ground between a stone wall and the wall of officers who teased, punched, kicked and choked him, before killing him in a barrage of 22 gunshots. In its powerful 2020 opinion, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit pushed back against the increasingly intolerable consequences of qualified immunity, a court-invented doctrine used as both shield and sword to block accountability for police violence and strip victims of their rights to redress. “Although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split-second decisions,” the Jones Court ruled, “we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of Black lives.” On Dec. 4, the Maryland Supreme Court will have an opportunity to address this crisis of impunity when it hears a case in which lower courts radically expanded the reach of qualified immunity to excuse the horrific police shooting of a 5-year-old child trapped amid police gunfire that killed his mother. After Korryn Gaines — a young Black woman experiencing mental health challenges — missed a court date for minor traffic tickets, heavily armed Baltimore County police kicked in the door of her home and found her with a gun, leading to a prolonged standoff. As Ms. Gaines huddled in her apartment with her 5-year-old son Kodi, more than 30 officers, police snipers and armor-clad SWAT units swarmed the apartment complex, with at least four armed officers stationed just outside Ms. Gaines’ door. The ensuing standoff continued for six hours. Then, a “hot” and “frustrated” Officer Royce Ruby — triggered when Ms. Gaines followed Kodi into the kitchen to make him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich — shot her in the back, killing her, leaving Kodi and his sister Karsyn motherless. Although the jury later found Ms. Gaines posed no threat to anyone, Officer Ruby aimed for her head, shooting through the kitchen wall with full knowledge that Kodi was just on the other side. The bullet from the high-powered rifle exited his mother’s body, ricocheted off the refrigerator, and struck Kodi in the face. Another bullet hit Kodi’s arm when Officer Ruby fired additional shots into his mortally wounded mother, all causing Kodi grievous injury and unimaginable emotional trauma. After a three-week trial in 2018, a Baltimore County jury found the police killing of Ms. Gaines and shooting of young Kodi both shocking and unconstitutional. The jury unanimously rejected the officer’s qualified immunity defense and awarded Kodi nearly $33 million in damages — perhaps the largest police misconduct verdict in Baltimore County history. In the years since the jury’s emphatic verdict, however, the trial judge overseeing the case — himself a former police officer — has second-guessed and undermined the jury through a series of legal rulings, most recently resurrecting qualified immunity to insulate police from liability and override Kodi’s rights. Worse still, earlier this year a panel of Maryland’s intermediate appellate court agreed, contending that qualified immunity protects police from liability and deprives Kodi of any remedy for the harms he suffered, because Kodi was merely an innocent bystander. Shockingly, Kodi’s case is not unique. There have been multiple shootings of innocent bystanders by mistake by police officers in Central Maryland and beyond. In fact, Baltimore County police officers have even shot their own fellow officers on multiple occasions, including a 2020 incident nearly killing an officer through so-called “friendly” fire. This is what Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has called qualified immunity’s “shoot first, think later” approach to policing. The notion that police should be immunized from liability for shooting a child like Kodi is sickening, as if his young life is mere collateral damage from their lawless violence against his mother. In its verdict finding that police bear liability for their unconstitutional shootings of Korryn and Kodi Gaines, the jury plainly sought to demand — as did the Fourth Circuit in the Jones case — that police must exercise their enormous power with at least basic “respect for the dignity and worth of Black lives.” For Maryland courts to say otherwise using the made-up doctrine of qualified immunity is unacceptable, and further entrenches the “shoot first, think later” approach that has perpetuated avoidable civilian injuries and deaths nationwide, despite overwhelming public outrage. If we have any hope of stemming the tide of police violence against Black people here in Maryland and across America, this has to stop. Deborah Jeon (jeon@aclu-md.org) is legal director for the ACLU of Maryland, which collaborated to submit a friend-of-the-court brief in the Maryland Supreme Court challenging egregious application of qualified immunity to protect police from consequences of their violence at the expense of an innocent Black child."

Subscribe to have The Washington Times’ Higher Ground delivered to your inbox every Sunday. Yet while these political games dominate news headlines, send the stock market into a nosedive, and put federal employees at risk of having to work without pay, nothing about these high-handed theatrics will diminish the immediate and very real dangers of the American Police State with its roadside strip searches, government surveillance, biometric databases, citizens being treated like terrorists, imprisonments for criticizing the government, national ID cards, SWAT team raids, censorship, forcible blood draws and DNA extractions, private prisons, weaponized drones, red light cameras, tasers, active shooter drills, police misconduct and government corruption. Default or not, surveillance will continue. Censorship and persecution of anyone who criticizes the government will continue. The government’s efforts to label dissidents as extremists and terrorists will continue. Police shootings will continue. Highway robbery meted out by government officials will continue. Corrupt government will continue. Profit-driven prisons will continue. The militarization of the police will continue. And wars abroad as well as the government’s ongoing war on the American people will continue. Indeed, take a look at the programs and policies that will not be affected by a government default on its debt leading to a possible shutdown, and you’ll get a clearer sense of the government’s priorities, which have little to do with serving taxpayers and everything to do with amassing money, power and control. Surveillance will continue unabated. On any given day, whether you’re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. The targeting of religious individuals will continue unabated. If you attend a church or subscribe to religious beliefs that are at odds with the mainstream, politically correct views, for ex., about abortion or homosexuality, you could be flagged as a threat. Indeed, the government is handing out $20 million in grants to police, mental health networks, universities, churches and school districts to enlist their help in identifying Americans who might be political dissidents or potential “extremists.” That includes planting spies in houses of worship as part of its so-called effort to combat domestic terrorism. The undermining of the Constitution will continue unabated. America’s so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, has chipped away at our freedoms, unraveled our Constitution and transformed our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws — which completely circumvent the rule of law and the constitutional rights of American citizens, re-orienting our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the rule of law, our U.S. Constitution, becomes the map by which we navigate life in the United States — will continue to be enforced. Militarized policing will continue unabated. Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, America’s law enforcement officials will continue to treat the American people like suspects rather than citizens. The shadow government— a.k.a. the Deep State, a.k.a. the police state, a.k.a. the military industrial complex, a.k.a. the surveillance state complex—will continue unabated. This corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials will continue to call the shots in Washington DC, no matter who sits in the White House or controls Congress. By “government,” I’m not referring to the highly partisan, two-party bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. Rather, I’m referring to “government” with a capital “G,” the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law. These issues are not going away. Whether or not the government runs out of borrowed money, it will remain business as usual in terms of the police state’s unceasing pursuit of power and control at the expense of the citizenry. – Constitutional attorney and author John W.

Richmond police Sgt. Donald Patchin said the man died at a hospital over the weekend. He had been rushed there after the Nov. 9 shooting on the parkway between Goodrick Avenue and Giant Highway. Authorities early Tuesday identified him as Arcjoseph Rodillo, 26, of San Pablo. Police did not announce any arrests, nor did they say what they think the motive may have been. They also did not provide a description of the vehicle the suspect was driving. The homicide is the seventh one investigated by Richmond police this year. That number does not include the June death of a person fatally shot by police as they served a warrant. A gunshot-detection alert and several emergency calls brought the shooting to police attention, Patchin said. He added that witnesses told officers that a driver in another vehicle was pursuing the victim and that somebody was shooting. The gunfire hit Rodillo at least once, Patchin said.

The plea agreement for Ryan, who retired as corrections director in September 2019, calls for a sentence of probation and an $8,500 payment to cover the Tempe Police Departmentâs costs in conducting the investigation. The offense carries a maximum sentence of up to two years in prison. Sentencing is set for Jan. 11. Police were called to the house on Jan. 6, 2022, on a report that Ryan had shot himself in the hand. It was later revealed by police that the hand injury was caused by a less-than-lethal projectile shot by police after Ryan pointed a handgun at officers. They say the projectile was found during surgery. Ryan also was injured when he fired his gun before police arrived. He apparently suffered a cut to the forehead after a bullet hit a bathroom sink and sent a splinter of porcelain flying. Police reports say Ryan had consumed a half bottle of tequila by the time officers arrived at his property. Police say Ryan slurred his words and was antagonistic toward a police negotiator, did not know why officers were at his home, or know what happened to his injured hand. Ryan also told police he didnât remember pointing a gun at officers and acknowledged drinking tequila that evening, though he said he had just two shots. Outside of court, Ryan declined to comment on his plea. Craig Penrod, attorney for Ryan, told the judge during the hearing that the no-contest plea was in the publicâs best interest. âHe has no specific recollection of the events,â Penrod said. According to police reports, Ryanâs wife called police because of the cut to his forehead. Police said Ryan told hospital staff that the cut was the result of an earlier fall, though the injury looked fresh. Ryan was never booked into jail after eventually surrendering to police and being taken to the hospital. Officers seized about 15 guns from his home. Ryanâs tenure as corrections director was controversial. A federal magistrate judge found him in contempt of court for not following through on promises in a legal settlement to improve health care for prisoners. He was previously criticized after the 2009 heat-related death of a prisoner who was left for nearly four hours in an unshaded outdoor holding cell during triple-digit heat. About five years later, prison officials were accused of botching the execution of Joseph Wood, who was given 15 doses of a two-drug combination over nearly two hours. Ryan also came under criticism in 2014 by a prison teacher who was raped after being left alone with a prisoner who was a sex offender. The teacher said Ryan allowed lax training, staffing shortages and poor security at the prison. Later in Ryanâs tenure, the corrections department was rocked by revelations that prisoners at the Lewis prison complex west of Phoenix were able to open their locked cell doors and attack corrections officers and other prisoners.

(AP) â Police shot and killed a 17-year-old early Sunday during a traffic stop in a mall parking lot in Bismarck, North Dakota, while investigating the teen in connection with a reported shooting. Police responded about 12:15 a.m. Sunday to gunfire in the area, according to a news release. Officers determined a shooting occurred near a hotel. Police subsequently began investigating 17-year-old Nicholas Bruington, of Bismarck, as the prime suspect, according to Lt. Luke Gardiner. About 1:50 a.m., officers stopped a vehicle in which Bruington was a passenger, near the Scheels sporting goods store in the Kirkwood Mall parking lot. Police said Bruington âhad a firearm and did not follow commands.â It wasn’t immediately clear whether Bruington pointed the gun at police. None of the officers were injured. Three officers shot at Bruington. Officers performed life-saving procedures until Bruington was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting, per the police department’s protocol. The three officers are on administrative leave, pending the probe. The news release did not identify them. Bruington was suspected of shooting at another juvenile, who police say was not injured. Bruington attended high school in Bismarck for a week or less at some point last year, but he was not enrolled in the public school district for the current year, Bismarck Public Schools spokesman Steve Koontz told The Associated Press. The district is prepared to offer support for students, if needed, in the wake of Bruington’s death, Koontz said. Squad cars and body cameras recorded video, Gardiner said. He didn’t say whether the cameras captured the events of the shooting. He referred queries to the bureau. North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, whose office oversees the bureau, did not immediately respond to a text message for questions about the shooting. The Associated Press was not able to leave a voice message due to his mailbox being full. The last fatal police shooting in Bismarck was in January 2020, Gardiner said. Earlier this year, a Fargo police officer shot and killed a gunman who had opened fire on other officers and a bystander as police responded to a routine crash along a busy street. The gunman killed one officer and wounded two others and a bystander before the fourth officer fatally shot him, ending the attack, which authorities have said appeared to be part of a much bigger plan."

The NYPD is using drones 3 times more than it did last year,2023-11-13,2023-11-14T16:32:59Z,en,gothamist.com,https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114163259id_/https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114163259/https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGdvdGhhbWlzdCkvbmV3cy90aGUtbnlwZC1pcy11c2luZy1kcm9uZXMtMy10aW1lcy1tb3JlLXRoYW4taXQtZGlkLWxhc3QteWVhcg~~,"The NYPD has more than tripled its use of drones in the last year, most recently deploying them 13 different times to monitor public protests last month, according to police data. Between April and June of this year, the department deployed drones 143 times. Before that, it had never deployed drones more than 50 times in a three-month period, the data shows. Police handed over drone footage from protests in Times Square and in Bay Ridge last month to prosecutors to use as evidence in criminal charges against 158 people, officials said. The NYPDâs drone fleet has doubled in size since the program was launched five years ago â from 13 drones then to 30 today, and will continue to expand in the coming years. New Yorkers attending large-scale events and celebrations are now likely to spot drones hovering overhead. They are being used to scan for sharks off summer beaches, make rescues during storms and capture the scenes of police shootings, police said. Prosecutors have historically used NYPD drone footage during the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement and as evidence in other cases like robberies, according to Oren Yaniv, a spokesperson for the Brooklyn district attorney. NYPD Assistant Commissioner Kaz Daughtry, who oversees the departmentâs new technology, says he hopes one day they will be saving lives by dropping flotation devices to struggling swimmers, and delivering the overdose prevention drug Narcan to people in drug-induced medical distress. Daughtry even said he is researching having drones respond to some crime reports. But as the NYPD looks to use drones in new ways, some civil liberties activists say they see it as an undemocratic violation of privacy. They, along with a tech policy expert interviewed by Gothamist, point out that no agency outside the NYPD oversees or regulates how the department uses information gathered by drones. âThis is a local police department that increasingly acts like a national intelligence agency,â said Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. âThe idea that you can have a drone hovering over a protest, collecting the identities of every person there, without any oversight, without any protections? That's unbelievably chilling.â In an exclusive drone demonstration for Gothamist, NYPD Detective Matthew Andrews-Sales, the NYPDâs head drone pilot, explained that the NYPDâs drone cameras can zoom in on people and objects up to 200x from the air, showing peopleâs faces clearly. But Daughtry said that function is reserved for New Yorkers committing crimes or infractions. The NYPD has long maintained that its drones arenât equipped with facial recognition software â technology that has led people to be falsely accused of crimes elsewhere. But police can run drone footage through facial recognition software back at police headquarters. Department officials said that a police detective manually reviews every facial match before police move to make an arrest. The NYPD deletes drone footage after 30 days unless it's being used to investigate an alleged crime like the Bay Ridge protest, and that the drones it currently uses cannot record audio, Daughtry said. Some tech policy experts consider drones to be among the least invasive policing strategies â as long as police arenât using them to mass identify every person at a protest. â[Drones] donât really give anything other than a different vantage point,â said Adam Scott Wandt, vice chair for technology of the Department of Public Management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. âThe police have cameras on poles and on top of cars everywhere anyway.â âYou should be expecting the government to be taking pictures of you from every angle.â How the program works The NYPDâs Technical Assistance Response Unit, which is headquartered at an old army base in Queens, already uses drones for a range of purposes. Officers used drones this summer to measure crowd size at JâOuvert and the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn and the Electric Zoo festival on Randallâs Island, Daughtry said. In September, police said they used a drone to help rescue someone trapped inside their car as heavy rains flooded the cityâs roadways. The drone footage was streamed to police headquarters, and officers deployed police and firefighters to help the driver exit safely. The NYPD also uses drones to capture scenes of police shootings, Daughtry said. They capture 360-degree visuals of buildings and streets, and the department pairs it with officer body-worn camera footage and then shows it to the commissioner for review. A live feed from the drones is screened at the police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, where dozens of officers monitor video from tens of thousands of police cameras across the five boroughs. Law enforcement officials in the field can also view the live drone feeds from their cellphones or iPads, Daughtry said. Mayor Eric Adams has championed police drones in part because he says they save the city money. While flying an NYPD helicopter costs up to $2,200 per flight, he said launching a drone costs just 17 cents. Some drones tethered to police cars can run on vehicle gasoline, Daughtry said. Program has been veiled in secrecy The NYPD has been tight-lipped about its use of drones, saying that revealing too much about the technology and when it is deployed could compromise police investigations. Officials have refused to share information on surveillance and technology products it has purchased, keeping contracts âofflineâ and out of the public eye. A state Supreme Court justice last month granted a request from the Legal Aid Society to access historically opaque NYPD âspecial expenseâ budget contracts for various electronic surveillance technologies â which could reveal more about policing technology and how it is used. Federal drone law says that âno person may operate a small unmanned aircraft over a human being.â But the NYPD has an exemption waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration through August 2025 that allows it to fly drones in populated areas, at night, over 400 feet in the air, among other things. The NYPD is also required to get special FAA authorization to fly its drones in certain cases, according to FAA spokesperson Arlene Salac. When asked for specific information about how often the NYPD flies its drones and for what purpose, Salac declined to say and asked Gothamist to submit a Freedom of Information Act request. NYC drones fleet continues to expand The NYPD paid $87,750 in June for a Lemur 2 drone manufactured by Seattle-based drone company BRINC, according to city records. Lemur 2 drones have night vision and thermal sensors. They can break glass to enter buildings and recreate floor plans with 360-degree views, which police say can be used for situations like the April parking garage collapse. The drones can even facilitate two-way audio conversations between officers and anyone inside a building. BRINC Founder and CEO Blake Resnick said the NYPD has not yet received its Lemur 2 drone. Adams has been a loud proponent of drones since his days as Brooklyn Borough President when he pushed for a bill in 2019 that would allow drones to conduct building inspections. As mayor last fall, he met with the founders of two Israeli drone companies who said their autonomous drones are used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to patrol the Mexican border, as well as by the Israel Defense Forces at the border of Gaza, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. The city has not yet entered into a deal with either of these companies, according to the mayorâs spokesperson Charles Lutvak. Adams and Daughtry also reviewed new drone technology in Israel while visiting the countryâs National Police Academy in August. The NYPD has a long history of training with Israeli law enforcement, according to Detective Charlie Ben-Naim, a department liaison stationed in Tel Aviv. Israel is at the forefront of using drones as first responders, Daughtry said, and serves as inspiration for his plans to increase the NYPDâs drone fleet. âWe're not looking for grandma's secret recipe sauce that she's putting on a grill. We're not looking to see if you're making hamburgers or hot dogs. We're out there using drones to fight crime,â Daughtry said."

Police responded about 12:15 a.m. Sunday to gunfire in the area, according to a news release. Officers determined a shooting occurred near a hotel. Police subsequently began investigating 17-year-old Nicholas Bruington, of Bismarck, as the prime suspect, according to Lt. Luke Gardiner. About 1:50 a.m., officers stopped a vehicle in which Bruington was a passenger, near the Scheels sporting goods store in the Kirkwood Mall parking lot. Police said Bruington ''had a firearm and did not follow commands.'' It wasn't immediately clear whether Bruington pointed the gun at police. None of the officers were injured. Three officers shot at Bruington. Officers performed life-saving procedures until Bruington was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting, per the police department's protocol. The three officers are on administrative leave, pending the probe. The news release did not identify them. Bruington was suspected of shooting at another juvenile, who police say was not injured. Bruington attended high school in Bismarck for a week or less at some point last year, but he was not enrolled in the public school district for the current year, Bismarck Public Schools spokesman Steve Koontz told The Associated Press. The district is prepared to offer support for students, if needed, in the wake of Bruington's death, Koontz said. Squad cars and body cameras recorded video, Gardiner said. He didn't say whether the cameras captured the events of the shooting. He referred queries to the bureau. North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, whose office oversees the bureau, did not immediately respond to a text message for questions about the shooting. The Associated Press was not able to leave a voice message due to his mailbox being full. The last fatal police shooting in Bismarck was in January 2020, Gardiner said. Earlier this year, a Fargo police officer shot and killed a gunman who had opened fire on other officers and a bystander as police responded to a routine crash along a busy street. The gunman killed one officer and wounded two others and a bystander before the fourth officer fatally shot him, ending the attack, which authorities have said appeared to be part of a much bigger plan."

"District Attorney’s Office finds no criminal liability in 4 officer-involved shootings, 2 in-custody deaths",2023-11-13,2023-11-14T08:03:27Z,en,sandiegouniontribune.com,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2023-11-13/district-attorney-review-officer-shooting-deaths,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114080327id_/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2023-11-13/district-attorney-review-officer-shooting-deaths,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114080327/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2023-11-13/district-attorney-review-officer-shooting-deaths,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNhbmRpZWdvdW5pb250cmlidW5lKS9uZXdzL3B1YmxpYy1zYWZldHkvc3RvcnkvMjAyMy0xMS0xMy9kaXN0cmljdC1hdHRvcm5leS1yZXZpZXctb2ZmaWNlci1zaG9vdGluZy1kZWF0aHM~,"District Attorney’s Office finds no criminal liability in 4 officer-involved shootings, 2 in-custody deaths Officers from San Diego, Harbor, Chula Vista and National City police departments were involved in the incidents in 2021 and 2022, which resulted in the deaths of five men and injured another The District Attorney’s Office reported Monday it had reviewed four recent shootings by law enforcement officers and two in-custody deaths and found the officers’ actions in each case were legally justified. The incidents occurred in 2021 and 2022 and resulted in the deaths of five men and serious injuries to one. The district attorney’s report found that the shootings or deaths happened during investigations by officers from four local agencies: the San Diego, Harbor, Chula Vista and National City police departments. In two of the shootings, people pointed guns or shot at the officers who then opened fire, officials said. The two other shootings occurred after the suspects approached officers armed with a knife or machete and ignored commands to drop their weapons, according to the review. The two men who died in police custody either overdosed and were experiencing a medical emergency, the findings showed. The district attorney said the officers will not be charged criminally. Here, in chronological order, are the six incidents as described by police and the District Attorney’s Office: Brian Umana, 28, was fatally shot Oct. 8, 2021, after National City Police Department officers received a report that a man armed with a sword was trying to break into a self-storage facility. When two officers arrived on the scene, they located Umana standing on the 33rd Street sidewalk, just west of National City Boulevard. He was holding a machete at his side. The officers commanded Umana to drop the machete, but he refused. The officers closed in on the man to use a Taser, getting within 15 feet of him. The Taser was ineffective, and the man stepped toward the officers with the machete raised over his head, according to the investigation. The officers fired a handgun and rifle, striking Umana. A toxicology report said Umana had methamphetamine and amphetamine in his system. Eric Jesus Medina, 29, was wounded during a gunfight with officers in front of the San Diego Harbor Police Department on April 10, 2022. Medina drove to the headquarters on North Harbor Drive and used a call box out front to ask a police dispatcher inside for help. When an officer walked out to help the man, Medina pointed a semi-automatic handgun at the officer, authorities said. Believing Medina was going to shoot him, the officer fired his weapon at Medina, according to the district attorney’s findings. Two other officers quickly responded and opened fire on the gunman. Medina was shot and eventually surrendered. He was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center with critical injuries. Earlier this year, Medina was sentenced to nine years in state prison. Denny Jalate, 23, died soon after San Diego police officers detained him on Oct. 9, 2022, at a home on 39th Street south of Thorn Street in City Heights. The man’s family had called 911 after he threatened to kill his stepfather and had thrown bricks through a sliding door and car window at the house. When officers arrived at the house, they found Jalate was being restrained on the ground by his parents, according to the district attorney’s review. Jalate had a weak pulse and was unresponsive, even as he was put into handcuffs, authorities said. Officers began to perform CPR and administered Narcan — a nasal spray used to reverse the symptoms of an opioid overdose. Paramedics took Jalate to Scripps Mercy Hospital where he died. The Medical Examiner’s Office listed alcohol poisoning, cardiovascular disease and obesity as “significant contributing factors” in his death. The district attorney found that officers had properly treated Jalate while he was in medical distress and awaiting an ambulance. Derrick Weatherspoon, 33, was gunned down by San Diego police after he opened fire on officers outside of a Southcrest taco shop on Oct. 18, 2022. On the night of the shooting, two officers responded to a report of a man with a gun at Humberto’s Taco Shop on South 43rd Street. As the officers arrived, Weatherspoon ran out of the restaurant and began firing at them, the investigation found. The two officers got out of their patrol car and returned fire. Weatherspoon was shot multiple times, but he continued to fire at the officers. Weatherspoon ran past the patrol car before he fell to the ground with the gun still in his hand. He died before he could be taken to a hospital. The gunman later tested positive for alcohol, amphetamine, methamphetamine and cocaine. Daniel Armenta, 35, died less than 30 minutes after police found him overdosing on methamphetamine and crawling on the street in City Heights. On Dec. 8, 2022, witnesses reported seeing Armenta acting erratically and walking in the middle of El Cajon Boulevard, near 43rd Street, forcing vehicles in the area to swerve to avoid hitting him. By the time officers arrived, Armenta had fallen to the ground in front of a gas station and was mumbling to himself. Officers called paramedics and supported the man as he got to his feet to walk over to a patrol car, according to investigators. He collapsed before reaching the vehicle and became unresponsive. The officers administered two rounds of Narcan and performed CPR, but Armenta did not regain consciousness. He died before he could be taken to a hospital. Bradley Munroe, 32, was shot and killed after walking toward a Chula Vista police dog handler while holding a knife in a parking lot on Dec. 18, 2022. On the night of the shooting, multiple callers reported a woman screaming for help and a man hitting her at a shopping center on Broadway near Oxford Street. According to the woman, who was later identified as Munroe’s mother, her son was mentally ill and trying to save her from her car, which he thought was going to explode. When the officer arrived on the scene, he noticed Munroe was carrying a knife. Munroe refused to follow multiple commands from the officer to drop the knife and get on the ground. He began to approach the officer with the knife still in his hand. After Munroe continued to ignore the officer’s orders and after a few more steps forward, the officer shot him, the investigation found. Munroe died before he could be taken to a hospital, police said. A toxicology report showed a number of drugs in his system at the time of the shooting, including amphetamine, meth, ephedrine, PCP and fentanyl. The latest news, as soon as it breaks.

But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the department’s latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today. Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Nov. 7, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life. They said the deadly police shooting has drawn attention to an issue they have been complaining about for years: that certain officers are known in the majority-Black community for harassing residents and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters. “They’re always jumping out on us for no reason. It happens all the time,” said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. “Now, we see the consequences.” McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots. Officials said officers on a District Action Team — squads focused on seizing illegal guns — were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the city’s most violent neighborhoods. In the immediate aftermath of the Nov. 7 shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officers’ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon. “This is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,” Worley said at the scene Nov. 7. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months. Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the city’s Black community. After Freddie Gray’s 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms. Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly-released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders. Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach. “The focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,” he said. “Communities don’t want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.” A study published by Webster’s team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but there’s “a ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrust” — partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence. Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimore’s low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era. “The name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,” researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers “focus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.” She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the department’s internal discipline process. “Due to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,” Eldridge said. “These teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.” Less than six months before the latest shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying “characteristics of an armed person.” The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them. “They look at everybody as suspects unless you’re old or a certain color,” Rashawn McNeil said. “It’s dehumanizing. That’s what it is.”"
"‘Malcolm X,’ the Met Opera revival, returns to New York. Oh, and there’s a spaceship.",2023-11-10,2023-11-11T05:13:47Z,en,gothamist.com,https://gothamist.com/news/malcolm-x-the-met-opera-revival-returns-to-new-york-oh-and-theres-a-spaceship,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111051347id_/https://gothamist.com/news/malcolm-x-the-met-opera-revival-returns-to-new-york-oh-and-theres-a-spaceship,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111051347/https://gothamist.com/news/malcolm-x-the-met-opera-revival-returns-to-new-york-oh-and-theres-a-spaceship,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGdvdGhhbWlzdCkvbmV3cy9tYWxjb2xtLXgtdGhlLW1ldC1vcGVyYS1yZXZpdmFsLXJldHVybnMtdG8tbmV3LXlvcmstb2gtYW5kLXRoZXJlcy1hLXNwYWNlc2hpcA~~,"There’s an unexpected, futuristic twist in the revival of the Anthony Davis opera “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X,” the original of which was first staged nearly four decades ago: A spaceship hovers over the stage throughout the entire production, and names familiar and perhaps unfamiliar scroll along the contours of the vessel. The Met Opera work, which opened last week at Lincoln Center, traces the life of the Black civil rights leader, from his childhood in Michigan to his final moments, when he was gunned down at age 39 in Audubon Ballroom, Washington Heights. Opening night was a glamorous affair, drawing notable Black figures including actress Lupita Nyong’o, scholar and philosopher Cornel West and the Rev. Al Sharpton. The spaceship serves as a futuristic twist on Marcus Garvey’s Black Star Line, which in the early 20th century transported African Americans by ship to Africa. But the list of names running along the side of the spaceship indicates that we’re in a new, modernized version of the opera, one that has been updated from the 1986 production. The references span 120 years of history. In addition to Black lynching victims like Fred Rochelle (1901) and Emmett Till (1955) and victims of police shootings such as 12-year-old Tamir Rice (2014), it includes Asian Americans and South Asian Americans who have been on the receiving end of racial hatred: Vincent Chin (1982), Balbir Singh Sodhi (2001) and Xiaojie Tan, who in 2021 was gunned down while working at Young’s Asian Massage outside of Atlanta. Civil rights is not just about Black people, it's about civil rights and human rights for everybody. Malcolm X was a human rights activist in the end. The choice to be racially inclusive was made by director Robert O’Hara, the Tony-nominated director of “Slave Play,” who said in an interview that it spoke to the life’s work of Malcolm X. “Civil rights is not just about Black people, it's about civil rights and human rights for everybody,” said O’Hara. “Malcolm X was a human rights activist in the end.” In life and well after his death, Malcolm X was a political lightning rod, but on stage he is presented as a meditative figure, one who was shaped by his years in prison and spiritually renewed by a late-in-life pilgrimage to Mecca. For some opera lovers the production of “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X,” which runs through Dec. 2, represents a cultural milestone. “The Met officially brands it worthy of the status of great American opera,” said playwright and director Tazewell Thompson. “It has entered the repertoire.” ‘Seared in my memory’ The opera made its world premiere in 1986, at New York City Opera. Thompson, a longtime playwright and theater director whose work often deals with the Black experience, said his recollection of the original production remains vivid. He distinctly recalled traveling from his apartment in Harlem “in an inside and out graffiti-covered subway” to Lincoln Center. “Seared in my memory,” said Thompson. He sat waiting with nervous anticipation in the “dead center” of the orchestra section. “When the curtain rose it seemed I held my breath until the final curtain was brought in.” The opera more than lived up to its expectations, he said in an email, by creating “an absorbing, enthralling spectacle,” one that was wide-ranging in its musical offerings: “vibrant, searing arias; an abundant fund of sensuous melody; stretches of seductive, repetitive choral chants; Wagner inspired harmonies; dazzling jazz.” Opera critic Fred Plotkin said the power of the original production held through in the current avatar, which he experienced Tuesday night, more than 37 years after first encountering “X.” “The score is magnificent,” said Plotkin, author of “Opera 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Opera,” who said he heard influences of Charles Mingus, Fats Waller and his “beloved” Duke Ellington. “What the music evokes, however, which is so wonderful about this music – it is original music. It's not derivative,” said Plotkin. “He's quoting, he's referring, but he's taking that music and going elsewhere with it,” he said of Anthony Davis. Black performers in a white space Naomi André, a musicologist and author of “Black Opera: History, Power, Engagement,” said the fact that “X” opened at the Met, “one of the most important opera stages in the world,” is that much more significant when viewed against the history of the form. “Opera for so long has been this predominantly, almost exclusively, all white space that's a very elitist space,” said André, who is the David G. Frey Distinguished Professor in the music department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Notable exceptions were Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, who was born into slavery in the early 1800s but eventually received voice lessons and became an internationally renowned opera performer. “She ended up singing for Queen Victoria in the 1850s,” said André. “Yeah, craziness.” André said for many aficionados the “breaking of the color barrier” in opera took place in 1955 when Marian Anderson made her debut at the Met, becoming the first African American to sing a leading role with the company. In subsequent years, other Black performers also made a name for themselves: Leontyne Price, George Shirley, Grace Bumbry. By and large, however, Black women had an easier time breaking through than Black men, said André. Once again, she argued, racism was at work. “There was still a real fear of miscegenation on the opera stage,” she said. “So it was easier to see Black women with white heroes than Black men with white heroines.” In recent decades, other problems have persisted in opera, said André, including the use of blackface and yellowface in “Otello,” “Turandot,” “Madama Butterfly” and “Aida,” among others. But André said the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted after the killing of George Floyd in 2020 forced opera to look inward. “Finally opera companies began to say, ‘Whoa, we have been incredibly exclusive.’ I mean, anybody could have told you that, but they finally noticed it.” In 2021, the Met presented “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” by Terence Blanchard, the first time the company had staged an opera by a Black composer in its 138-year history. Not long after, the Met signed on to “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X.” Very much supported by the Met O’Hara, the director, said the Met wasn’t in the picture when talks began – it was initially a joint venture between opera companies in Detroit, Seattle and Omaha. But once it signed on, he said the institution was fully supportive. “Peter Gelb, the general manager, he always had my back,” said O’Hara. Still, he said, he told the company early on that it would have to “earn the right for us to be telling this story here,” and “acknowledge that you have not had us here before. That you have not told these stories.” O’Hara said these demands emerged in part from the strain the material placed on the creative team, including “the actors who have to basically kill a Black man every night in front of your audience.” As a public service, he proposed that the Met hold a marathon reading of the entire “Autobiography of Malcolm X, as Told to Alex Haley,” which ultimately took place on Oct. 29 and was free to the public. Readers included actor Courtney Vance, Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz (daughter of Malcolm X) and Bill Haley, the grandson of Alex Haley. The reading took place over 18 hours. The book, said O’Hara, is “very uncomfortable” at times. “You don't have the right to put an X in front of your building and expect comfort,” said O’Hara. “Malcolm X didn't provide comfort. He provided the truth.” And although Malcolm X was assassinated, O’Hara said he’s “not really dead,” because we continue to talk about him. Occasionally, he said, people raise the question: What would Malcolm X have thought of the fact that his revolutionary life was now being told in this extremely white, extremely rarefied arena – albeit one with a floating spaceship? “He would probably be rolling around in his grave going, ‘What the hell is going on? Why is my story being told there?’” said O’Hara. “So hopefully we have done a service to him.”"

Morrisonâs short had its world premiere seven months ago, at Visions du RÃ©el, in Nyon, Switzerland, the first of 10 European venues â including the new Unarchive Found Footage Festival, in Rome, where it won for Best Short â before tentatively entering the Americas by way of Cinemancia, in MedellÃn, Colombia, only landing in the United States in September, at Telluride. That Morrisonâs most overtly relevant work to contemporary U.S. society launched at rarefied festivals outside the United States is as comprehensible as it is anomalous. Incident is a rough-looking film about a rough topic. Composed of publicly accessed digital surveillance footage, the 30-minute video documents, virtually in real time, a white copâs contentious killing of a Black man five years ago in Chicago.Â Itâs also a very personal film. Set on Chicagoâs South Side, near where Morrison was born and raised, it premiered there in a screening and community conversation attended by the victimâs mother â notably, only 10 days before its New York premiere in the East Village, where the artist has lived and worked since he arrived here to study at Cooper Union almost 40 years ago.Â Bringing Incident home, to New York as well as Chicago, seems to have been fraught. Yet itâs not only the forensic subject of the work â recently named to the International Documentary Associationâs short list of best shorts of 2023 â but its digital sources and form that seem, at first look, to signal a significant departure from the artistâs noted oeuvre.Â Morrison has been making new films from bits of old ones for the better part of three decades. His works are new not simply because they interpolate in the present footage produced in the past. Theyâre new because they expand the contemporary practice of documentary art, by projecting moving-image history not as nostalgic preservation but as dynamic conversation between movies made and viewed by bygone others and those Morrison makes from them today. Morrisonâs best-known films feature visually noisy silent-age footage that he mines in archives. Manically unstable nitrate stock generates the optic static that erupts as abstract phantasms gamboling into frames inhabited by unsuspecting co-stars from yesteryears. The title of Morrisonâs singularly iconic work, Decasia (2002), adumbrates the chameleonic decay that brands his entire oeuvre. Named in 2013 to the National Film Registry of movies deemed intrinsic to the heritage of the United States, it is preserved in the Library of Congress, itself a repository of oodles of reels that have contributed to multiple Morrison projects, including Decasia.Â An audiovisual symphony that elides narrative exposition, Decasia nonetheless dives deeply into history, not to explain events but to evoke time across temporalities: the known time of the footageâs production, the unknown time of its material transformation, and, finally, the time of Morrisonâs creation. Those historical poetics have remained in place even as his most recent long-form films â notably, Dawson City: Frozen Time (2016) and The Village Detective: A Song Cycle (2021) â have become increasingly expository by narratively addressing film history itself, as well as weaving stories about individuals on the screen and around it in ways that rehearse Incidentâs dedication to relating its story.Â I first learned of Incident when I joined Morrison across the street from Cooper Union, at McSorleyâs Old Ale House, on a cold November evening a year ago. A couple of months earlier, I had published an essay about The Village Detective, a meditation about Morrisonâs own archival practice expressed through its contemplation of the long career of Soviet movie star Mikhail Zharov. Triggered by an Icelandic lobster trawlerâs incidental dredging of a partial print of the Russian actorâs most popular movie (Morrisonâs titular source), a widely available 1969 sound film, and decayed by the ocean (not long-obsolete nitrate stock), The Village Detective now feels like an incidental transition to Incidentâs abandonment of esoteric cinematic sources altogether. In any case, as Morrison and I discussed my take on his last feature, he mentioned his new short and subsequently provided me access to the work-in-progress.Â I found Incident startling on its own, but also for how it magnified Morrisonâs practice. As I viewed its evolving iterations, I recognized that its evident divergences from Morrisonâs prior works â notably, its absence of both old cinema and new music as well as its direct focus on a recent real-life event â only distilled his constant commitment to social relevance, exploring the ambiguity of visual evidence, and visualizing time as contextual, not absolute. Even before I attended a screening of an almost-final cut last December, I knew that I wanted to discuss Incident with Morrison. Â Â In May, as Incident hopped around Europe, Morrison and I met again at McSorleyâs, just around the corner from this paperâs former long-time headquarters on Cooper Square, where Morrison told me that, back in the day, he âwould pick it up on Wednesday nights from the office and get a jump on stuff.â The same waiter who greeted Morrison with easy familiarity when we met last fall did so again this past spring. âRich and I are about the same age and he was working here when I was coming here for burgers on my lunch breakâ (from Cooper Union, back in the late â80s), Morrison told me. The filmmaker is a McSorleyâs steady, the locution Joseph Mitchell recorded in his indelible New Yorker profile of the Old Ale House, in 1940, at what is now about the halfway point in its history.Â Â i was sitting in mcsorleyâs.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â outside it was New York and beautifully snowing.Â Â Â â e.e. cummings (1925) Â Morrison is part of a tradition. A pantheonâs worth of Gotham artists has been drawn to McSorleyâs. Some, like Mitchell, markedly documented their connection. John Sloan painted the haunt realistically a dozen years before E.E. Cummings wrote about it cubistically. Berenice Abbott â who, like all women (before the National Organization for Women successfully sued the establishment for discrimination, in 1970), could not drink there â nevertheless lobbied successfully to document the jointâs interior, in 1947. Her photographs are visual evidence that what Mitchell reported a few years earlier, about the saloonâs first 86 years â that all of its owners âhave been opposed to changeâ â remains relevant 83 years later.Â Indeed, the tavernâs artifact-plastered walls exhibit dedicated preservation. The bar is an inhabited archive. But material conservation can provoke artistic innovation. As Cummingsâs line suggests, the dissonance between McSorleyâs atavistic interior and the contemporary world through its windows could be supremely generative. Old things inspiring new creations is, after all, the essence of documentary art. Maybe that, as well as the burgers and ale, and his longtime connection with Rich, continues to draw Morrison there. Much like his nitrate sources, Morrisonâs practice has changed across time, movement that Incident punctuates. It jettisons the romance of the archive. The texture of its surveillance footage does not beguile. Itâs not degraded; itâs simply low-grade. But Incidentâs form as well as its content enthralls. Morrisonâs split-screen editing divides time spatially, synchronically juxtaposing different views of the roughly half-hour that surrounds the killing of Harith âSnoopâ Augustus, a 37-year-old father of a then-five-year-old daughter, who was walking near where he cut hair, at the Sideline Studio. The footage does not speak for itself. The artist is present and necessary â a lesson relevant for our fragmented media age, saturated with audiovisual evidence but starved for discerningly creative interpretation.Â Producing history across media, in print or video, is an act of informed revision. Incident re-visions two iterations of the footage from which it draws: the truncated video that the Chicago police department claimed cleared Dillan Halley â the probationary police officer who killed Augustus on July 14, 2018 â by showing that the shooting was a reasonable âsplit-secondâ defensive decision, and Six Durations of a Split Second: The Death of Harith Augustus, the public video installation â produced in 2019 by Chicagoâs Invisible Institute (a co-producer of Incident) and deploying analytic animations rendered by Forensic Architecture â which critically challenged not only the official judgmentâs exculpatory conclusions but also the temporal terms of its analysis: the assertion that the cause of Augustusâs death could be reduced to a split second. âPolice shot! Shots fired at the police.â These most unquestionably untrue words, radioed by the cops reporting the âincidentâ (police parlance for a police shooting), reveal Incidentâs most undeniable truths: official disregard for the truth and for the victim, as cops self-protectively, counterfactually, reflexively closed ranks at the scene (as well as in their postmortem investigation). Halley insisted immediately, âHe pulled a gun on us!,â an invention that his partner, Megan Fleming, fervently confirmed. (Halley, the shooter, received only a two-day suspension for not turning on his body cam in a âtimely manner,â one of the five violations also cited in Flemingâs 60-day suspension, which, Incident reports, included both âstopping a suspectâ and âmaking physical contact without justification.â) Augustusâs intentions after the police physically accost him may remain subject to individual and institutional interpretation, or, more likely, predisposition. But the copsâ intentions are evident after Halley kills Augustus. Accordingly, Incident could be meaningfully retitled, Incidental. This works not only because much of the videoâs multicam footage was recorded incidentally but also because of how incidental, how bone-chillingly inconsequential, Augustusâs life appears to be to the police cavalierly conversing, indifferent to the victimâs body lying a few feet from their feet, as bystanders resolutely condemn the shooting of their neighbor as a mortal misdeed. Although most Morrison works reassemble silent footage, they are anything but silent. Music is vital to his practice. He has closely collaborated with composers on his films â including Michael Gordon (Decasia, 2002), JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson (The Minersâ Hymns, 2010), Bill Frisell (The Great Flood, 2012), Alex Somers (Dawson City: Frozen Time, 2016), David Lang (The Village Detective, 2021). Heâs also produced numerous projections for such iconic iconoclasts as Steve Reich (Different Trains, 2016) and John Adams (The Death of Klinghoffer, 2003; Nixon in China, 2017; and Antony and Cleopatra, 2022/2023).Â Morrison also follows the blues. And if ever there were a story that resonates with the blues, itâs Harith Augustusâs stunningly sudden demise on an early-summer late afternoon on Chicagoâs South Side: senselessly shot by a panicky cop, stumbling into the gutter, gunned down, down the street from where he barbered. Yet, unlike most Morrison movies, Incident has no music but does have lots of found sound and silence. Body-cam-recorded audio and police-radio transmissions prevail, sonic evidence rigorously synced to action; when corresponding sound for closed-circuit footage is absent, the scene is deathly silent.Â In our conversation, Morrison cited Akira Kurosawaâs Rashomon (1950), which dramatizes four divergent testimonies of one murder, as Incidentâs inspiration, initially as a narrative work. Indeed, aspects of the actual documentary, especially the acting by the police, rival narrative cinema. Too, Incident achieves the realist effects that narrative films have attempted, most obviously Mike Figgisâs Timecode (2000), which simultaneously projects four 90-minute interlaced docufictions (each shot in one surveillance-like take) on a quadrated split-screen. But it is Incidentâs sonic scheme â even more than its visual form â that indexes its approach to history as well as its place in film history. Â Â Incidentâs sound design projects a sharply connective contrast with the monumentally significant, genre-defying, true-crime film of the past century, one also dedicated to forensic analysis of official injustice. Errol Morrisâs The Thin Blue Line (1988) â which, like Decasia (a movie Morris has fulsomely praised), is on the National Film Registry â was the first of Morrisâs three movies (so far) scored by Philip Glass, with whom Morrison has also collaborated. But Incident is an audiovisual counterpoint to The Thin Blue Lineâs aestheticization of history, as it is to Morrisonâs own prominently scored films. Where Morrisonâs short starkly juxtaposes non-professionally shot archived footage that shockingly observes a copâs specious curbside shooting of Augustus, sans composed sound, Morrisâs feature stylishly stages minimalist mises-en-scÃ¨ne â as burnished as Glassâs minimalist harmonics â that create haunting cinematic evidence of a criminalâs roadside killing of a cop in a predigital, pre-dash-cam age. The filmsâ formal differences exhibit, however, a shared commitment to self-reflexive re-creation of specific moving-image regimes, as well as (unjustly adjudicated) deadly shootings. The Thin Blue Line untangles as a serpentine Hollywood noir, a mystery climatically solved by a truth revealed. Along its way, Morris interviews a menagerie of B-filmish, real-life characters playing themselves in scenes that are as hauntingly staged as his filmâs dream-like dramatizations. Contrastingly, Incidentâs look resembles a multicam security monitor, anywhere today. Its narrative and visual form is its politics; thereâs no mystery, no emotional redemption, no legal compensation, just lethal reality:Â a shot of straight hooch cut with a jigger of ambiguity. Â Incident ends where it begins: Harith Augustus shot dead. Its story is less an arc than an ellipse, a deformed circle. There is no progress, only the antiheroic actuality of American Exceptionalism, writ small. Itâs a craggy blues story, minus the melody. As Morrison told me at McSorleyâs, âItâs a bummer of a film. And some of my films, as difficult and challenging as they can be, the people who like them are uplifted by them. And this, I think, nobody leaves this film happy.â (The interview below has been edited for clarity and concision from a face-to-face conversation with Morrison in May 2023 and an email follow-up in October. SF) Â SETH FEIN: How did Incident happen? BILL MORRISON: Thereâs a journalist out of Chicago, Jamie Kalven [credited as Incidentâs co-producer]. He runs something called the Invisible Institute. He originally filed the lawsuit Kalven v. City of Chicago to make all police recordings public record, and then broke the Laquan McDonald case by suing for the dashboard cam, which made all Chicago police records public access and required that they be released within 60 days, which is sort of the premise that this film sets up: Thatâs new for the cops and theyâre all sort of performing now. They know that theyâre on camera and thatâs going to be reviewed.Â [Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke killed 17-year-old McDonald in October 2014. Van Dykeâs claim of self-defense unraveled with the release of dash-cam footage that showed he fired 16 times at McDonald, who was retreating. Van Dykeâs upcoming September trial hovered over Chicago, Incident explains, on the day Halley shot Augustus. Convicted of second-degree murder, Van Dyke had served only 39 of his 81-month prison sentence when released, in February 2022.] Jamie wrote about the Augustus case extensively in The Intercept. Â â¦ and heâs an old family friend. Iâve known him since I was a kid. And weâd meet on the street sometimes [in Chicago, where Kalven lives near Morrisonâs mother], either he was walking his dog or he was running and we would talk. And one thing we were talking about, as he got more and more into surveillance, was this idea of a modern-day Rashomon written as a narrative, not a doc, in which each retelling of a crime would be from a different camera â an iPhone, a surveillance camera, a dashboard camera, closed-circuit TV, a body cam â they would all tell a different truth. And that was a really compelling idea. And I still think itâs a compelling idea. But as he continued to write about this piece and then did sort of an epilogue last summer [2022] kind of wrapping it up, about what happened, none of these cops served any time.Â Jamie included, sort of as footnotes, the footage that had been released. He was referencing, like, 40-second clips. But as I went deeper into those and their sources, which were all up on a Vimeo channel administered by COPA (Chicagoâs Civilian Office of Police Accountability), you could get the entire reel of what the police had shot. And then he had a mother lode of other body-worn camera footage, which he gave me. I showed him a bit of a rough treatment of what I planned to do with this and he got very excited and said, Hereâs everything I got.Â I went back to that footage and I saw that you could tell the story from many different angles continuously, synchronously. So I started applying rules. One of the rules was that you should always be able to see the victim alive or dead. I might have broken that a couple of times, but for the most part Augustus is on view from the moment the police encounter happens till heâs carried away in the ambulance. So I said to myself, let me see how far I can take that. And then youâre sort of aware of this guy everyone is ignoring. You know, the actual corpse and heâs also belied the main lies of the police [that Augustus had attacked them]. I thought there was a way to put it together where there was this bunch of different views. And, as I started playing with it, I realized it also heightened your anxiety to have the same thing happening from a different point of view [simultaneously visible], sharing the same audio, that all of a sudden you didnât know where to look, where to read, and as a viewer you became sort of vulnerable.Â How long did you work on it? I would say I began it in September of 2022 and I wrapped it in March, so six months.Â How did you finance it?Â Itâs all public-domain footage. It didnât cost me anything. It just cost me time. What did you do with the footage in postproduction?Â There was one session with the audio, we had to decide whose mic [among the multicam footage appearing onscreen at once] was going to stand out the most, when we were going to go into surround sound, what rules to make for that.Â Composed music has been central to your films. Did you ever consider music for Incident?Â Once I came up with the idea that I wanted to start with that wide shot and then back into it, that of course is all silent because itâs on the POD (police observation device), I thought it might be confusing to people, projectionists for instance, to have the first minute and a half silent, and that there was an opportunity there for [a musical] artist.Â But by the time I finished it, I realized what an important role silence was playing. I realized you had to start with silence to realize how little you knew about what was going on from seeing these cyphers [small figures in the wide opening shot] on the street. And you donât have the audio to tell you the story, and that at the end when all the police officers turn their body cams off â¦ you go back to silence. Youâre back out on that same street without a clue. Like itâs all been cleaned up and that spoke to the fact that we donât control that media or who has access to it; without the cooperation of the police, we wouldnât know what was happening. It speaks to who owns the media and how it gets out.â¦Â Also, in defense of the police, they canât be asked to turn cameras on and off when it gets hot, so I think those cameras should be on all the time. I think they should be uploading all the time. According to Jamie, who spoke to Axon [the body-cam manufacturer], the 30-second buffer, where you can see video from 30 seconds before but not [hear the] audio, is to protect the police from something stupid they might have said 30 seconds before that could have exacerbated or escalated things. Given the Invisible Institute installationâs existence, why make Incident?Â Well, Iâm somewhat opportunistic with my projects. I like to find a project thatâs supported by an archive. Dawson City was supported by an archive. The Village Detective was supported by [the reels dredged from the sea] and, by extrapolation, the larger Russian archive. So as a filmmaker who works by himself, who doesnât shoot a lot of original material, Iâm interested in trying to tell a story with, if not a single archive, an archive thatâs implied by a group of archives. So, in this instance, I saw an incredibly rich and deep story that could be told with a single body of work.Â I also thought that Iâd said [in past works] a lot about the archive by referencing stuff that was old. And that the archive is becoming increasingly important as a harbinger of what actually happened; itâs becoming less and less clear what actually happened and that this was a prime example of it, even with all this material you can draw different conclusions about what actually happened, and thatâs without deep fakes or AI or anything like that. So even an incredibly well-mediated moment when there are more cameras than there should be on a given instant, which is also a product of our racism and paranoia, thereâs an archive that can tell this story in a rich but also ambiguous way. And it was almost immediately clear to me that the work that Jamie had done was incredibly helpful groundwork, but it had not gone into this type of cinema.â¦ I guess another big difference between what I did and what they did is that I included a lot of crowd commentary that becomes a chorus. One person says, What do yâall need this yellow tape for? You know what yâall did â¦ And really thereâs a way in which this entire story could be told from the perspective of that riot and what caused this riot [about three hours later, when the police attacked protesters], where you start there and you go backward. I didnât want there to be time breaks [as there are in Six Durations]. So I became obsessed with this as a continuous story. There was something compelling about watching how this unfolds, how quickly it happened, how quickly it was all swept up. But also the endlessness of it. How this corpse was lying there endlessly and also how time can seem to stand still. What was the political impact of Six Durations of a Split Second in Chicago?Â Iâd say that Harith Augustus is still not a well-known name. That South Shore community knows him, but he hasnât gained the pantheon of Laquan McDonald, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor. Heâs not like a well-known name that a European would know. The Americans who were in the audience [in Europe] were like, we donât know that name either. So, part of that is he was carrying a gun and may or may not have reached for it. The way the news put it, as you see in one of the Invisible Institute essays, the [police] talking heads were like He had a gun and it was over. The police released that footage of him touching his gun, which reframed him as a perpetrator â¦ and the case was closed. He wasnât martyred. I think that the work Invisible Institute did with Forensic Architecture actually shows that Halley had drawn the gun and was ready to go and so that if youâre in Augustusâs position, youâre between the two cars and turning around, you already see a guy pointing a gun at you, youâre already dead. So why not take a shot, I think it had reached that stage. We donât have the camera to show that, but thatâs what I think happened.Â Â Â Do you see Incident as potentially having a different political impact than Six Durations? I thought there was a way to tell this story that was also about the media and that was self-reflexive in that way, that was not only politically challenging but challenged the media and talked about what the media can do. So, I got very excited; I got excited by being able to play with something on a media level but that would also have political and cultural impact. And that would also recast what I do.Â Do you find it more liberating or confining to produce art from an archive that others have mined for their own interpretation of the same event?Â That would assume that everyone had seen Six Durations. So I told the story from the beginning. And I wanted the footage to tell the story. You do have my voice as text giving it context, but it was very important to me that for the most part the footage spoke for itself that it wasnât manipulated, except for the epilogue, where I slowed it down.Â Incident shows that Halley was ready to fire because he was scared. Iâm wondering if Augustus was scared, too, because, although he was a licensed handgun owner, he wasnât a licensed concealed carrier. I looked into what it takes to get an Illinois carrierâs permit. Itâs not that hard: $150 and a government-issued ID, plus the Firearms Owners Identification card (gun ownerâs permit), which Augustus had on him.Â In a state that allows concealed carry, youâre not really allowed to stop someone and say Do you have a license for that unless theyâre exhibiting some behavior like brandishing it or threatening someone, where it becomes an issue, so itâs sort of like, Who gets to carry a gun and who doesnât. It seems ironic that, as Incident explains, local business owners, who were presumably Black, wanted more cops on the street, and that itâs likely Augustus owned a gun for protection from crime.Â Thereâs great irony. Augustus was in a cash business, sometimes working by himself. Itâs a hot summer day. Itâs the end of the day. Theyâre sort of bored. And youâre right, theyâve been ironically put there by the business owners, because, you canât overemphasize the context of the Laquan McDonald trial, which was just about to happen, so thereâs a lot of tension between the community and the cops, and the cops are aware that theyâre not well loved in that community. And theyâre not from there and they have been dropped in there destined to lose. They havenât been supported by the system either.Â New York, which has at times been a subject of your films, is very important to who you are and what you do. But Chicago is where youâre from and remains central to your identity; you still root for the Bulls and the White Sox. Were you drawn to Augustusâs story because of your connection to Chicago, especially its South Side, where you grew up?Â My mom and my sister still live in Hyde Park which is two miles to the north of South Shore. It is a very different neighborhood, but 71st Street [where Incident happens] is a commercial strip. Itâs a middle-class neighborhood; Michelle Obama grew up there. And as you can tell from the passersby on the street, thereâs an incredible range of people going about their business. Augustusâs killing is kind of a freak occurrence for a place like that.â¦ There was a blues club that I used to go to for years, right around the corner from there, called Leeâs Unleaded thatâs probably been closed for five or six years (but thereâs a rumor that it will start up again). My connection to that neighborhood is going to Leeâs, which still to this day is absolutely my favorite club ever.Â So, in what ways is Incident about you? If I make a movie about coal miners in the northeast of England [The Minersâ Hymn, 2010], if I make a movie about Dawson City, as an American telling a story about a Canadian city, I never get that question. When I made The Great Flood [2013], all of a sudden itâs about the African American experience moving into Chicago. I said, well, in a certain way thatâs more about the neighborhood I grew up in than any of these other films.Â Incident is more directly engaged with contemporary politics than anything youâve done before. But I think all your films are political. Thatâs not new.Â Thank you. Not everybody â¦ I mean in Europe it was like, You finally made a political film and I was like, Iâve been making political films.Â I think race is very present in all your films, even in ones that are not directly about race. For instance, Dawson City deals with the indigenous peoples of Yukon, and Decasia, by not being specifically about race, shows us, without narration, incidentally, and therefore powerfully, the prevalence of colonialism, visualized racially, in the Westâs film culture.Â Yeah. Thatâs a very interesting point. Buried News, you saw? I donât know it. Itâs the short I made in 2021 using race riots from the Dawson City collection. All of the newsreel footage is about lynch mobs.â¦ It definitely ties in with Incident, and the two films will be shown together someday.Â I want to discuss Incidentâs form in relation to your prior works. The big difference is what this material is; itâs low-grade video material so it leant itself to being smaller frames. These wipes and kind of cheesy video effects,Â I wouldnât have tried using nitrate film.Â Â Whatâs compelling to me about Dawson City [Morrisonâs feature, which tells the story of, as well as stories around, long-buried and, in many cases, long-lost silent films unexpectedly unearthed in Canadaâs Yukon territory] is that, as it itself documents, its footage had been dug up and archived a long time ago. That reveal explicates the heart of what youâve been doing across your career: less discovering than re-interpreting, using film art to show us things we wouldnât otherwise see. The same is true in The Village Detective, because its titular source turns out, as you, again, reveal, to be not a lost film but a lost print of a well-known film, which provides an opportunity for new storytelling. And going back to your short The Mesmerist (2003), it re-edited the elliptical remains of decrepit reels of The Bells (1926) â otherwise available as a well-preserved, more-complete feature â to tell a different story, around a specific character, than the one originally told. Yeah.Â So Iâm wondering if Incidentâs re-telling of Augustusâs story â where the archival footage has not only already been selectively presented by the Chicago police and then critically reanalyzed by the Invisible Institute â actually clarifies your practice, which has depended less on finding old things than in constructing new stories from them? In other words, despite its many obvious differences in source and form from your prior works, is Incident actually less a jump cut from than a continuation of your practice across your career?Â Of course, I think of it as a continuity. I saw what Jamie had done, and I was excited by it, but I also saw an opportunity to further the earlier conversation, the Rashomon conversation that he and I had had, because the installation didnât do that. It was very important that it got the facts and the context and the history out there. And for me, I saw something more akin to a narrative. And Jamie saw it as a continuation of the work that the Invisible Institute had done. Way back, when you discussed Dawson City with my students at Brooklyn Collegeâs Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, one asked if you thought in the future you would work with decaying digital media. You answered very declaratively, No, elaborating that you didnât find digital video visually compelling. After Incident, do you still feel that way?Â I get that question a lot.â¦ Students in particular often ask me: Can you see applying this to digital imagery? I donât think what I obsessed about in Incident was the decay of digital, or even the materiality of the video archive. This is more content based and thatâs why I felt more at ease about wiping in and quadrating the footage. I donât think of this stuff as a physical object. Itâs something that got uploaded; itâs a file. The thing is the digital breakdown has very little subtlety to it, itâs either 1 or 0 [computer binary code] and glitches out for a while. There are no happy accidents, or very few; thereâs no gradation. Thereâs a world of romantic imagery within the decay of film you just donât see in digital video. From the beginning of your work becoming well known, with Decasia, critics have described it as both raising the dead and evoking mortality. In Incident you deal with an actual death and a video resurrection; you begin with Augustusâs end, with his killing, and then bring him back, observing how his end unfolded on earth in ways, not unlike found-footage characters in your other films, which he can neither witness nor could foresee.Â Right, Right. Does Incident, then, suggestively dramatize, via Augustusâs story, the essence of your own practice, usually with old films, by displacing it onto contemporary video?Â You know, I donât make films thinking about how it fits into my larger body of work. I think itâs interesting, with perspective, to say, Oh wow, that does continue that story. Thatâs the first time someoneâs said that to me, and I wasnât thinking of that. I think youâre right, though, that the curtain of mortality is always between the audience and whatâs intriguing is that it becomes a mirror of our own mortality.Â I hope that in some ways people can see themselves in Harith Augustus. I think thereâs always going to be that question, Why did he run? You and I wouldnât have run. Itâs a different experience, I think, being a Black guy on the South Side of Chicago and having a bunch of cops come up on you. Your day is not going to end well. Youâre not going to be able to walk away and say, Ok, next time Iâm going to bring my license. Thanks for that. This is the way that I think it would have gone had [Quincy] Jones [the Black cop who was questioning Augustus before Halley and his partner, Megan Fleming, both white, intervened] continued his conversation. I think it was going to be a warning or a conversation, before it got escalated. Do you consider Incident art? I do.Â Yeah, I do. If you take the seagull [which flies into the footage that opens and closes Incident], that was a happy accident. It becomes the narrator. The omen. Yeah. Your films have often made me think of Bruce Connerâs works. And Incident made me think particularly of Report (1967), about JFKâs assassination, because of the found footage and especially found sound from broadcast news.Â Thatâs a great comparison. Yeah and also Perfect Movie (1986), by Ken Jacobs, thatâs news footage in the wake of Malcolm Xâs assassination. So, in a certain way Incident is found public footage that tells a story reassembled. I love the Conner comparison. Do you think that art can keep this story alive? Weâve become so desensitized to police killings. By documenting this story in this form do you think Incident has, do you hope it has, the potential to re-sensitize people to this all-too-familiar tragedy, because we view it in an unexpected format rather than just clips on the news or social media.Â Right. And also, it is a timely piece, an evergreen piece, but itâs not about something that happened yesterday. It happened five years ago. In a way it becomes iconic in that way. I think what makes it a compelling story is that it doesnât come out and say that thereâs a right or wrong here. I certainly think it could have ended differently and could have been avoided, but there is an ambiguity, which makes it a more interesting case. There were all these cameras on and we still donât really know what Augustusâs intent was. We do know that he didnât draw. He never unholstered it; he was trying not to drop it. Maybe he was trying to keep his pants up.Â Has Incident changed you?Â I donât know how itâs going to change my work. It was a long time [spent via the archival footage] on that street corner in 2018, immersed in that kind of arcane examination and relistening, and the acute choreography of how a moment goes down.â¦ So that placed me in a certain time and a place like Iâve never done before. That was different. I went back to Chicago in November [2022] and went right to that block and walked up and down it; the trees had grown a little higher but I saw where the railing around where the tree pit was and the cracks and I went to the sandwich shop and got a sandwich and everybody looked at me like I was a cop! [laughs]. How does it feel to see Incident finally out in the world? Seeing it in Europe, I knew that in some ways I was in a safe zone, because Iâm presenting our freaky country with our freaky gun laws. Everybody could say you guys are freaks and I could agree with them. We are. â Â Seth Fein is a historian and documentarian. He operates Seven Local Film in Jackson Heights, Queens, where he lives.

"No charges for Baltimore Police who shot teen in May or pursued car that later struck pedestrian, state’s attorney says",2023-11-10,2023-11-11T02:16:06Z,en,baltimoresun.com,https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-no-criminal-charges-shipley-hill-february-collapse-20231110-ylvyljeofbfxdlexlghsclolce-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111021606id_/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-no-criminal-charges-shipley-hill-february-collapse-20231110-ylvyljeofbfxdlexlghsclolce-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111021606/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-no-criminal-charges-shipley-hill-february-collapse-20231110-ylvyljeofbfxdlexlghsclolce-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bikvbWFyeWxhbmQvYmFsdGltb3JlLWNpdHkvYnMtbWQtY2ktYmFsdGltb3JlLXBvbGljZS1uby1jcmltaW5hbC1jaGFyZ2VzLXNoaXBsZXktaGlsbC1mZWJydWFyeS1jb2xsYXBzZS0yMDIzMTExMC15bHZ5bGplb2ZiZnhkbGV4bGdoc2Nsb2xjZS1zdG9yeS5odG1s,"The Baltimore Police officer who shot a 17-year-old from behind in May, after chasing him by foot in Shipley Hill, will not be criminally charged, the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office determined. Nor will the officers who in February pursued a reportedly stolen vehicle that subsequently crashed into another car, then collided with a pedestrian, killing him, according to declination reports posted online by State’s Attorney Ivan Bates’ office. Baltimore prosecutors wrote that the actions of Officer Cedric Elleby, who shot the teen, were “objectively reasonable,” and that the officers who had sought the fleeing vehicle “acted reasonably and lawfully” and “did not cause the fatal accident that killed” the pedestrian, Alfred Fincher. The two reviews of police interactions for possible criminal charges are likely among the last to be conducted by Baltimore prosecutors, as the power to make charging decisions in statewide police-involved fatalities was transferred to the Office of Attorney General, effective Oct. 1. The first police case in which the Attorney General will have prosecutorial decision-making is Tuesday’s fatal police shooting in Baltimore’s Millhill neighborhood. It has drawn scrutiny this week and led to comparisons to the Shipley Hill incident from May. In both, District Action Team members approached residents and attempted to stop them because they believed the individuals to be armed. Both residents fled on foot, before later being shot by police. [ After Baltimore Police fatally shoot man in Millhill, neighbors question whether foot pursuit was necessary ] Footage from Tuesday’s police shooting has not yet been publicly released, while Elleby’s body camera footage showed him ordering the teen to drop a weapon and to stop, then firing his weapon four times, striking the teen at least once. In prosecutors’ review, they wrote that before Elleby fired his weapon, the teen had “turned slightly to his right.” His right arm, in which he held his gun, also moved to the right, prosecutors said, “as if [he] and his gun were turning toward the [officer].” Prosecutors also added he was running toward a man on nearby porch steps. “In the split second that the [teen] swung his arm to his right, a reasonable officer could have believed that the [teen] was turning himself towards the officer to shoot at him,” the report said. “It appears clear that that’s what the [officer] thought as well, as that’s the moment that he opened fire.” Beyond fearing for his own safety, prosecutors added, the officer “would have” feared for the safety of the entire community, including the man on the steps. The report did acknowledge the possibility that the teen was “merely trying to dispose of his firearm,” and that he was going to turn into the nearby alleyway to continue running from the officer. But Elleby “simply could not assume either of those facts at the moment he pulled the trigger,” prosecutors wrote. “What the [officer] saw in front of him was an armed man running towards another man and ignoring lawful orders,” it said. The 16-page report also examined the initial stop of the teen. The two District Action Team detectives believed a group gathered along McHenry Street were “likely involved in illegal activity,” and thus decided to engage, according to prosecutors. When they got closer, they noticed a “bulge” in the teen’s waistband and Elleby “decided that he needed to investigate.” That, prosecutors said, was “more than a hunch.” Baltimore Police had been criticized for an initial statement that the 17-year-old had been “displaying characteristics of an armed person,” which neighbors and other critics suggested was vague terminology created to justify stopping people. [ After Baltimore Police shooting, some question: What does ‘displaying characteristics of an armed person’ really mean? ] “We’re relying on these officers’ testimony in court that they’re getting it right all the time, and it’s a very nebulous area,” defense attorney Natalie Finegar said in May. “Basically, you’re saying ‘somebody’s holding their arm funny,’ ‘somebody’s walking funny’ — but you don’t even know necessarily if that person has some sort of physical disability.” Breaking News Alerts Similarly, neighbors have questioned officers’ pursuit of Hunter Jessup on Tuesday, which led to the fatal shooting. One resident, Mike Davis, argued this week that police should stop chasing people solely in pursuit of firearms, saying “don’t chase us and shoot us just for all that.” The other report, into February’s fatal crash, found that officers’ initial pursuit of the stolen vehicle was lawful. It was terminated by a lieutenant over the radio, according to prosecutors, but could have continued under relevant law. The report quotes the lieutenant as saying, “Alright, just let it go, guys, it’s westbound on Sinclair, it’s traveling at a high rate of speed. It looks like it’s gonna go southbound on Wolfe and come out around,” then adding seconds later, “It’s not worth it, break it off.” The nearest police officer at that point decelerated and continued to drive southbound behind the car, slightly less than one block behind. The prosecutors’ declination report identifies that officer as “Yancey,” with no last name, but the Independent Investigations Division and a city salary database both list him as Devin Yancy. It was “mere seconds later” that the fleeing vehicle ran a red light, collided with another car, then struck a pedestrian, Fincher, the report found. The car also struck a vacant building that then collapsed. In reviewing available evidence, prosecutors put “particular emphasis” on the statement of one of the people inside the allegedly stolen vehicle, who said she wasn’t aware officers were pursuing it when the collision occurred, and the statement of a bus driver who told police he saw “no evidence of a police chase” at the time of the crash. Prosecutors concluded that the police officers “acted reasonably and lawfully.”"

(AP) — The ex-Louisville police officer on trial for firing into Breonna Taylor’s apartment the night she was killed testified Thursday he had to react quickly after a fellow officer was shot in the leg during the drug raid. Brett Hankison said he saw a muzzle flash come from inside Taylor’s hallway after officers knocked down the door in the early hours of March 13, 2020, to execute a search warrant. He testified he believed it sounded like an assault rifle, so he moved to the side of Taylor’s apartment and fired shots in through a sliding glass door and window. “I had to react,” Hankison said on the witness stand in U.S. District Court Thursday. “I had no choice.” Taylor’s boyfriend had fired a single shot at officers after they came through the door, and two officers at the entry returned fire, striking and killing Taylor in the hallway of her apartment. While no one was hit by the 10 shots he fired, prosecutors have argued Hankison was shooting erratically without identifying a target. Some of his gunshots went into an occupied neighboring apartment. Hankison said he moved away from the entry door, rounded the corner of the apartment and sprayed bullets into the side windows and sliding glass door because he believed a shooter was advancing on officers in the doorway. He said he believed the officers “were taking automatic gunfire and were trapped.” The officers at the door fired a combined 22 shots after Taylor’s boyfriend fired a single round. “It sounded like he was walking up on us … like he was executing” the other officers, Hankison said. Hankison, 47, has been charged with two federal civil rights violations for endangering Taylor, her boyfriend and Taylor’s neighbors, who shared a wall with her apartment. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Federal prosecutors are attempting to do what Kentucky prosecutors couldn’t — convict Hankison for his actions on the night Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death. He was acquitted by a jury last year of wanton endangerment charges. Prosecutors at this trial have argued Hankison did not follow police use of force policies when he decided to fire through Taylor’s windows and sliding door. When his attorney asked him about that, he said he “didn’t have time to think about a policy.” “You’re acting to save lives, or not acting and people are going to die,” Hankison said. Hankison said he feels “horrible” about Taylor’s death and that it was “tragic for a lot of people and a lot of families.” Her death along with George Floyd’s at the hands of Minneapolis police officers sparked weeks of protests over police brutality in the summer of 2020. Hankison was also critical of the warrant, saying he and the other officers should have never been sent to her apartment that night. The Taylor warrant was one of five served simultaneously the night she was killed, part of a wide-ranging narcotics operation targeting a known drug dealer. The dealer was located in another part of town but had a previous relationship with Taylor. Three other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant have been charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany in their trial next year. The former Louisville officer shot by Taylor’s boyfriend during the raid, Jonathan Mattingly, also testified Thursday, saying he was standing in front of the door when it opened and saw a muzzle flash in the dark. He said he saw two figures at the end of the hallway before he was shot.

The San Diego Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, identified the man as 48-year-old Douglas Quinn of Indiana, who was on parole. The Escondido Police Department officers involved in the shooting were identified as Anthony Lay and Michael Statti. Lay is a six-year employee of the department, while Statti has worked for the department for one year as a patrol officer. The events that led to the fatal shootout began shortly after 6:30 a.m. last Friday, when Escondido police received a report of a trespasser asleep in a sleeping bag on the porch of a mobile home on East Valley Parkway, according to the San Diego Police Department. San Diego investigates police shootings in Escondido under the terms of a countywide agreement to prevent conflicts of interest. The two Escondido police officers arrived at the mobile home park about 10 minutes later and stopped Quinn, who had since been reported as being seen pushing a motorcycle through the complex. âDuring the contact, based on the information provided by the (man), they learned he had a felony warrant for a parole violation out of Indiana,â San Diego police Lt. Jud Campbell said. âAs officers began to detain (him), he turned and began to run. He also began reaching into his waistband.â The suspect then allegedly pulled a gun, pointed it across his body at the officers and opened fire, according to police. The officers returned fire, wounding the suspect, who fell to the ground, the lieutenant said. âHe then rolled over with the gun, again pointing it in the direction of (the) officers, prompting one of them to fire several more rounds at him,â Campbell said. The officers provided first aid to the mortally wounded suspect prior to the arrival of paramedics. An ambulance crew took Quinn to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No other injuries were reported. Once San Diego police completes the investigation, the county District Attorneyâs Office will review it to determine if either officer will face any charges. Escondido Police will conduct an administrative investigation into the officersâ discharge of their firearms, authorities said. The FBI and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office will also monitor the investigation, according to San Diego police. The latest news, as soon as it breaks. Get our email alerts straight to your inbox.

But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the departmentâs latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today. Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life. They said the deadly police shooting has drawn attention to an issue they have been complaining about for years: that certain officers are known in the majority-Black community for harassing residents and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters. âTheyâre always jumping out on us for no reason. It happens all the time,â said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. âNow, we see the consequences.â McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots. Officials said officers on a District Action Team â squads focused on seizing illegal guns â were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the cityâs most violent neighborhoods. In the immediate aftermath of Tuesdayâs shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officersâ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon. âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said at the scene Tuesday. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months. Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the cityâs Black community. After Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms. Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders. Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Universityâs Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach. âThe focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,â he said. âCommunities donât want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.â A study published by Websterâs team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but thereâs âa ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrustâ â partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence. Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimoreâs low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era. âThe name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,â researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers âfocus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.â She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the departmentâs internal discipline process. âDue to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,â Eldridge said. âThese teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.â Less than six months before Tuesdayâs shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying âcharacteristics of an armed person.â The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them. âThey look at everybody as suspects unless youâre old or a certain color,â Rashawn McNeil said. âItâs dehumanizing. Thatâs what it is.â"

(AP) — The ex-Louisville police officer on trial for firing into Breonna Taylor’s apartment the night she was killed testified Thursday he had to react quickly after a fellow officer was shot in the leg during the drug raid. Brett Hankison said he saw a muzzle flash come from inside Taylor’s hallway after officers knocked down the door in the early hours of March 13, 2020, to execute a search warrant. He testified he believed it sounded like an assault rifle, so he moved to the side of Taylor’s apartment and fired shots in through a sliding glass door and window. “I had to react,” Hankison said on the witness stand in U.S. District Court Thursday. “I had no choice.” Taylor’s boyfriend had fired a single shot at officers after they came through the door, and two officers at the entry returned fire, striking and killing Taylor in the hallway of her apartment. While no one was hit by the 10 shots he fired, prosecutors have argued Hankison was shooting erratically without identifying a target. Some of his gunshots went into an occupied neighboring apartment. Hankison said he moved away from the entry door, rounded the corner of the apartment and sprayed bullets into the side windows and sliding glass door because he believed a shooter was advancing on officers in the doorway. He said he believed the officers “were taking automatic gunfire and were trapped.” The officers at the door fired a combined 22 shots after Taylor’s boyfriend fired a single round. “It sounded like he was walking up on us … like he was executing” the other officers, Hankison said. Hankison, 47, has been charged with two federal civil rights violations for endangering Taylor, her boyfriend and Taylor’s neighbors, who shared a wall with her apartment. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Federal prosecutors are attempting to do what Kentucky prosecutors couldn’t — convict Hankison for his actions on the night Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death. He was acquitted by a jury last year of wanton endangerment charges. Prosecutors at this trial have argued Hankison did not follow police use of force policies when he decided to fire through Taylor’s windows and sliding door. When his attorney asked him about that, he said he “didn’t have time to think about a policy.” “You’re acting to save lives, or not acting and people are going to die,” Hankison said. Hankison said he feels “horrible” about Taylor’s death and that it was “tragic for a lot of people and a lot of families.” Her death along with George Floyd’s at the hands of Minneapolis police officers sparked weeks of protests over police brutality in the summer of 2020. Hankison was also critical of the warrant, saying he and the other officers should have never been sent to her apartment that night. The Taylor warrant was one of five served simultaneously the night she was killed, part of a wide-ranging narcotics operation targeting a known drug dealer. The dealer was located in another part of town but had a previous relationship with Taylor. Three other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant have been charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany in their trial next year. The former Louisville officer shot by Taylor’s boyfriend during the raid, Jonathan Mattingly, also testified Thursday, saying he was standing in front of the door when it opened and saw a muzzle flash in the dark. He said he saw two figures at the end of the hallway before he was shot. Mattingly, who retired from the police force in 2021, said he couldn’t tell where Hankison was standing when the shots started, but heard a “barrage” of gunfire at the side of the building. Hankison’s testimony will continue in federal court on Monday."

The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders. Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Universityâs Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach. âThe focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,â he said. âCommunities donât want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.â A study published by Websterâs team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but thereâs âa ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrustâ - partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence. Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimoreâs low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era. âThe name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,â researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers âfocus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.â She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the departmentâs internal discipline process. âDue to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,â Eldridge said. âThese teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.â Less than six months before Tuesdayâs shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying âcharacteristics of an armed person.â The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them. âThey look at everybody as suspects unless youâre old or a certain color,â Rashawn McNeil said. âItâs dehumanizing.

Former Louisville officer charged in Breonna Taylor raid says he was defending fellow officers,2023-11-09,2023-11-11T02:14:48Z,en,newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/former-louisville-officer-charged-in-breonna-taylor-raid-says-he-was-defending-fellow-officers-jyrlpll4,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111021448id_/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/former-louisville-officer-charged-in-breonna-taylor-raid-says-he-was-defending-fellow-officers-jyrlpll4,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111021448/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/former-louisville-officer-charged-in-breonna-taylor-raid-says-he-was-defending-fellow-officers-jyrlpll4,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG5ld3NkYXkpL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uL2Zvcm1lci1sb3Vpc3ZpbGxlLW9mZmljZXItY2hhcmdlZC1pbi1icmVvbm5hLXRheWxvci1yYWlkLXNheXMtaGUtd2FzLWRlZmVuZGluZy1mZWxsb3ctb2ZmaWNlcnMtanlybHBsbDQ~,"Former Louisville officer charged in Breonna Taylor raid says he was defending fellow officers LOUISVILLE, Ky. â The ex-Louisville police officer on trial for firing into Breonna Taylorâs apartment the night she was killed testified Thursday he had to react quickly after a fellow officer was shot in the leg during the drug raid. Brett Hankison said he saw a muzzle flash come from inside Taylorâs hallway after officers knocked down the door in the early hours of March 13, 2020, to execute a search warrant. He testified he believed it sounded like an assault rifle, so he moved to the side of Taylorâs apartment and fired shots in through a sliding glass door and window. âI had to react,â Hankison said on the witness stand in U.S. District Court Thursday. âI had no choice.â Taylorâs boyfriend had fired a single shot at officers after they came through the door, and two officers at the entry returned fire, striking and killing Taylor in the hallway of her apartment. While no one was hit by the 10 shots he fired, prosecutors have argued Hankison was shooting erratically without identifying a target. Some of his gunshots went into an occupied neighboring apartment. Hankison said he moved away from the entry door, rounded the corner of the apartment and sprayed bullets into the side windows and sliding glass door because he believed a shooter was advancing on officers in the doorway. He said he believed the officers âwere taking automatic gunfire and were trapped.â The officers at the door fired a combined 22 shots after Taylor's boyfriend fired a single round. âIt sounded like he was walking up on us ... like he was executingâ the other officers, Hankison said. Hankison, 47, has been charged with two federal civil rights violations for endangering Taylor, her boyfriend and Taylorâs neighbors, who shared a wall with her apartment. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Federal prosecutors are attempting to do what Kentucky prosecutors couldnât â convict Hankison for his actions on the night Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death. He was acquitted by a jury last year of wanton endangerment charges. Prosecutors at this trial have argued Hankison did not follow police use of force policies when he decided to fire through Taylor's windows and sliding door. When his attorney asked him about that, he said he âdidnât have time to think about a policy.â âYouâre acting to save lives, or not acting and people are going to die,â Hankison said. Hankison said he feels âhorribleâ about Taylor's death and that it was âtragic for a lot of people and a lot of families."" Her death along with George Floydâs at the hands of Minneapolis police officers sparked weeks of protests over police brutality in the summer of 2020. Hankison was also critical of the warrant, saying he and the other officers should have never been sent to her apartment that night. The Taylor warrant was one of five served simultaneously the night she was killed, part of a wide-ranging narcotics operation targeting a known drug dealer. The dealer was located in another part of town but had a previous relationship with Taylor. Three other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant have been charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany in their trial next year. The former Louisville officer shot by Taylor's boyfriend during the raid, Jonathan Mattingly, also testified Thursday, saying he was standing in front of the door when it opened and saw a muzzle flash in the dark. He said he saw two figures at the end of the hallway before he was shot. Mattingly, who retired from the police force in 2021, said he couldn't tell where Hankison was standing when the shots started, but heard a âbarrageâ of gunfire at the side of the building. Hankison's testimony will continue in federal court on Monday. Northwell patient data breach ... First game since student's deathÂ ... Boy Scouts honor vets ...

It has continued to use the killing machinery crafted by President George W. Bush, expanded by President Barack Obama and employed by President Donald Trump. These presidents have used drones and other unmanned projectiles to target persons in foreign countries with which the United States is not at war. They have done this notwithstanding the prohibition against taking life, liberty or property from any person — not just any American, but any person — in the Constitution each has sworn to uphold, and they have done so pursuant to secret rules that they themselves have established for these killings. Last year, 11 senators and 39 members of the House of Representatives sent a harshly worded letter to President Joe Biden asking him to stop the secret, but not the public, killings. As of this writing, he has not publicly replied. Here is the backstory. The purpose of the Bill of Rights — the first 10 amendments to the Constitution — is to protect personal liberty by restraining the government. The Fifth Amendment prohibits killing persons, restraining liberty and taking property without due process; that means a jury trial at which the government must prove criminal behavior or fault, depending upon its goal. If the country is at war — lawfully and constitutionally declared by Congress — obviously the president can use the U.S. military to kill the military of the opposing country. And if an attack on the U.S. is imminent, the president can strike the first blow against the military of the entity whose attack is just about to occur. There are no other constitutional circumstances under which a president may kill. When President Harry Truman targeted Japanese civilians as the Japanese government was within days of surrendering in World War II, he murdered them. Notwithstanding his unprosecuted war crimes, and with the government’s version of Pearl Harbor still fresh in many Americans’ minds, Truman was regarded as heroic for using nuclear bombs to cause the profoundly immoral, militarily useless and plainly criminal mass killings of the hated Japanese. Fast-forward to the 9/11 era, and Bush had precedent to begin his own presidential killings of people the government wanted Americans to hate. While Congress did authorize him to use force against those who caused or aided the 9/11 attacks, we all know that his thirst for Middle Eastern blood knew no regard for the Constitution, evidence, proportionality, civilian lives, morality or human decency. Thus, $3 trillion spent and 1 million dead in Afghanistan and Iraq. Julian Assange sits in a British dungeon awaiting decisions on his extradition to the U.S. because he courageously, lawfully and constitutionally published documents and videos demonstrating conclusively that Bush’s use of drones targeted and murdered Afghan and Iraqi civilians, and his administration covered it up. Obama took this to another level when he targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in the U.S. Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, advised Obama that the killing was lawful, as al-Awlaki had encouraged folks in the Middle East to fight against American soldiers there. Holder likened killing al-Awlaki to police shooting at a bank robber whom they are chasing while he is shooting at them. Holder forgot that al-Awlaki was unarmed, was not charged or indicted for any crime, was never accused of violence, and was not even the subject of an arrest warrant when a drone evaporated him while sitting at an outdoor cafe in Yemen. The exercise of power by the federal government is largely based on precedent and politics. Whenever a president wants to kill, he need only find an example of a predecessor having killed with impunity — without due process, without a declaration of war and without an imminent attack. And then he needs only to calculate what he thinks he can politically get away with. Joe Biden — whose drones in 2021 destroyed a dam in Syria, killing thousands, and who targeted civilians in Afghanistan, killing dozens, and whose shipments of guns to Ukraine and Israel are killing tens of thousands of folks he wants us to hate — is using unlawful powers that his modern predecessors used and got away with to target and kill unsympathetic persons. But the U.S. has not declared war on Russia or Gaza. The nature of political power is to expand so that it fills a perceived need, unless there are mechanisms in place to restrain its expansion. The founding generation believed that British monarchs had no limits on their powers and that was a good enough reason for the 13 colonies to secede violently. They also believed that they had crafted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to impose sufficient restraints on the federal government. And they believed that the states could peacefully leave a federal government they had voluntarily joined when it exceeded its constitutional powers. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Its language is clear that only Congress writes laws and declares war, and presidents can kill only troops in wartime or civilians consistent with due process. Sadly, the Founders were wrong. Every president takes an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution as it was written, not as he may wish it to be. Yet, today, the president writes laws and rules that let him restrain personal liberty and kill with impunity, and Congress and the American people let him get away with it. Formally, we still have a Constitution. Functionally, it has utterly failed to restrain the government. Ultimately, we have ourselves to blame for these killings and undeclared wars. Why do we repose the Constitution for safekeeping into the hands of those who subvert it? If a future president uses Bush’s lust and Obama’s logic and Biden’s hatreds to kill Americans in America, then no one’s life, liberty or property will be secure.

"After Baltimore Police fatally shoot man in Millhill, neighbors question whether foot pursuit was necessary",2023-11-09,2023-11-10T02:58:15Z,en,baltimoresun.com,https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-shooting-millhill-20231109-iq46n5vshzejzgxotzqujvqoey-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110025815id_/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-shooting-millhill-20231109-iq46n5vshzejzgxotzqujvqoey-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110025815/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-shooting-millhill-20231109-iq46n5vshzejzgxotzqujvqoey-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bikvbWFyeWxhbmQvYmFsdGltb3JlLWNpdHkvYnMtbWQtY2ktYmFsdGltb3JlLXBvbGljZS1zaG9vdGluZy1taWxsaGlsbC0yMDIzMTEwOS1pcTQ2bjV2c2h6ZWp6Z3hvdHpxdWp2cW9leS1zdG9yeS5odG1s,"About 24 hours after Baltimore Police shot a man on Wilkens Avenue in Southwest Baltimore, a group of friends gathered across the street and described some of Hunter Jessup’s final moments. One of them who said he witnessed the shooting in the Millhill neighborhood described watching Jessup flee police while gripping his pants and a backpack, then falling amid rapid gunfire. Neighbors, meanwhile, questioned whether the fatal police foot chase was necessary and lamented the tense relationship between residents and police officers who patrol the neighborhood seeking guns. In an interview, Mike Davis, 28, asked why so many officers couldn’t arrest Jessup without killing him, and said police should stop engaging in foot pursuits just to get guns off the streets. “If we got guns on us and we running from you, don’t chase us and shoot us just for all that,” said Davis, who said he heard 10 to 15 shots Tuesday from inside his home on Wilkens Avenue. “If we know running away is not going to help us, we’re going to shoot” officers. Police have said multiple officers fired at a man who pointed a gun at them as he ran from them. Authorities have not identified the individual who was pronounced dead at University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, but police said Tuesday they believed he was an adult. Two of his brothers identified him as Hunter Jessup, who neighbors said lived in the 2700 block of Wilkens Avenue with his girlfriend. Police Commissioner Richard Worley said police recovered a handgun with an extended magazine from the scene. On Wednesday afternoon, blood stained the sidewalk in the 2600 block of Wilkens Avenue, in what is Baltimore’s longest unbroken row of townhomes. A broken window and a twisted railing that appeared to have been hit by a bullet were visible in the middle of the nearly treeless block. Friends and his brothers remembered Jessup as a giving person who kept to himself. Amare, a 14-year-old neighbor whose mother asked that he be identified only by his first name, said Jessup was “always goofy.” “We was always sitting right there, goofing around, listening to music everyday,” Amare said. “This one day, police took him from me.” Southwest District Action Team officers initially tried to stop Jessup near the corner of Brunswick and St. Benedict streets because they believed he had a gun, Worley said Tuesday. The commissioner said there had been “several shootings” in the area and officers were doing a “proactive patrol.” The city’s crime map shows the Millhill neighborhood has seen one aggravated assault and some burglary and larceny offenses in the past 28 days, but no homicides or attempted murders. It lists three shootings in the past year. Since the July 9 police redistricting, the Southwestern District has experienced eight homicides and 31 nonfatal shootings, as of Nov. 4. The city overall is seeing a decline in homicides and nonfatal shootings this year — 228 homicides, as of Wednesday, compared to 289 at the same time in 2022; and 557 nonfatal shootings so far, compared to 619 last year. Police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said in an email Wednesday that there have been 146 gun arrests in the Southwest District as of Nov. 5, up 5% compared to the same time last year. Earlier this year, a District Action Team member shot and wounded a 17-year-old in nearby Shipley Hill. The teams are specialized squads that a district commander can direct toward patrol needs or violent crime arrests. They also play a role in the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy, an initiative geared toward dismantling groups behind the city’s shootings. Eldridge said Wednesday that officers who pursued Jessup were on routine patrol, unrelated to the Group Violence Reduction Strategy. Some have suggested District Actions Teams are a rebranding of the department’s past controversial flex squads. Critics say it’s important to scrutinize both the work of the teams and the selection of members. Similar to Tuesday’s Millhill shooting, the officer in the Shipley Hill police shooting approached an individual, suspecting he was armed. That teen also fled. In Shipley Hill, Officer Cedric Elleby could be heard in body camera footage ordering the teen to drop his weapon, before then shooting the teen from behind. Worley said Tuesday that officers also warned Jessup to drop his weapon before firing. In late June, Baltimore Police officers shot and killed a 40-year-old Baltimore man in East Baltimore on June 29. Two of the five officers who fired their weapons in the shooting were Southeast District officers, while two were assigned to the Eastern District Action Team, according to the Attorney General’s Office. The fifth was part of a Southeast/East Side Initiative, the office said in a news release. Body camera footage in that shooting showed Darryl Gamble, who was wanted by police, shoot at officers before they returned fire. The five officers fired about 40 rounds, police have said. Roughly 33 casings from Gamble’s weapons were recovered, police said in July. Tuesday’s shooting was captured on body camera, officials said. It likely will be released publicly in coming days. [ Baltimore Police fatally shoot man who they say pointed gun at officers Tuesday afternoon in Millhill ] D, an 18-year-old who asked to be identified by his nickname for safety reasons, said members of the District Action Teams harass him and his friends. “We’re being children, we’re being kids,” he said. “Kids gonna be outside.” Breaking News Alerts Worley said Tuesday that Jessup drew a gun before an officer tackled him. He pointed his weapon at police before multiple officers fired at him, then immediately rendered aid, Worley said. Tuesday’s police shooting will be the first investigated by the Office of Attorney General’s Independent Investigations Division since the office’s prosecutors were granted authority to bring criminal charges against officers in police-involved civilian fatalities. The Maryland General Assembly earlier this year granted the Attorney General prosecutorial power in those cases, which can include in-custody deaths, police shootings and fatalities following police pursuits. It marked a shift from recent years when those investigations were handed over to local prosecutors for final determinations. The law change went into effect Oct. 1. The attorney general recently hired a deputy chief of litigation and is currently in the process of hiring an additional prosecutor and a paralegal evidence/analyst, spokesperson Thomas Lester said in an email to The Baltimore Sun. Going forward, the unit will no longer forward its investigative report to local prosecutors but instead announce its own decision."
Baltimore police shooting prompts criticism of specialized gun squads,2023-11-09,2023-11-10T08:08:55Z,en,newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-specialized-gun-squads-t0nu2w1f,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110080855id_/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-specialized-gun-squads-t0nu2w1f,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110080855/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-specialized-gun-squads-t0nu2w1f,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG5ld3NkYXkpL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uL2JhbHRpbW9yZS1wb2xpY2Utc2hvb3RpbmctcHJvbXB0cy1jcml0aWNpc20tb2Ytc3BlY2lhbGl6ZWQtZ3VuLXNxdWFkcy10MG51MncxZg~~,"Baltimore police shooting prompts criticism of specialized gun squads BALTIMORE â After a corruption scandal led the Baltimore Police Department to disband its plainclothes gun squad in 2017, the embattled agency pledged to increase oversight while remaining focused on seizing illegal weapons and curbing rampant violence. But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the departmentâs latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today. Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life. They said the deadly police shooting has drawn attention to an issue they have been complaining about for years: that certain officers are known in the majority-Black community for harassing residents and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters. âTheyâre always jumping out on us for no reason. It happens all the time,â said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. âNow, we see the consequences.â McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots. Officials said officers on a District Action Team â squads focused on seizing illegal guns â were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the cityâs most violent neighborhoods. In the immediate aftermath of Tuesdayâs shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officersâ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon. âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said at the scene Tuesday. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months. Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the cityâs Black community. After Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms. Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders. Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Universityâs Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach. âThe focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,â he said. âCommunities donât want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.â A study published by Websterâs team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but thereâs âa ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrustâ â partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence. Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimoreâs low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era. âThe name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,â researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers âfocus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.â She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate.

It didnât indicate whether he died from the shooting or the knife injuries. Officers were called to a Long Beach home shortly before 9 a.m. Tuesday by reports that a man had stabbed his mother, who was hiding in a room.

It has continued to use the killing machinery crafted by President George W. Bush, expanded by President Barack Obama and employed by President Donald Trump. These presidents have used drones and other unmanned projectiles to target people in foreign countries with which the United States is not at war. They have done this notwithstanding the prohibition against taking life, liberty or property from any person â not just any American, but any person â in the Constitution each has sworn to uphold, and they have done so pursuant to secret rules that they themselves have established for these killings. Last year, 11 senators and 39 members of the House of Representatives sent a harshly worded letter to President Biden asking him to stop the secret, but not the public, killings. As of this writing, he has not publicly replied. Here is the backstory. The purpose of the Bill of Rights â the first 10 amendments to the Constitution â is to protect personal liberty by restraining the government. The Fifth Amendment prohibits killing persons, restraining liberty and taking property without due process; that means a jury trial at which the government must prove criminal behavior or fault, depending upon its goal. If the country is at war â lawfully and constitutionally declared by Congress â the president can use the U.S. military to kill the military of the opposing country. And if an attack on the U.S. is imminent, the president can strike the first blow against the military of the entity whose attack is imminent. There are no other constitutional circumstances under which a president may kill. When President Harry Truman targeted Japanese civilians as the Japanese government was within days of surrendering in World War II, he murdered them. Notwithstanding his unprosecuted war crimes, and with the governmentâs version of Pearl Harbor still fresh in many Americansâ minds, Truman was regarded as heroic for using nuclear bombs to cause the immoral, militarily useless and plainly criminal mass killings of the hated Japanese. Fast-forward to the 9/11 era, and Mr. Bush had precedent to begin his own presidential killings of people the government wanted Americans to hate. While Congress did authorize him to use force against those who caused or aided the 9/11 attacks, we all know that his thirst for Middle Eastern blood knew no regard for the Constitution, evidence, proportionality, civilian lives, morality or human decency. Thus, $3 trillion was spent, and 1 million people lost their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. Julian Assange sits in a British dungeon awaiting decisions on his extradition to the U.S. because he courageously, lawfully and constitutionally published documents and videos demonstrating conclusively that Mr. Bushâs use of drones targeted and murdered Afghan and Iraqi civilians, and his administration covered it up. Mr. Obama took this to another level when he targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in the U.S. Mr. Obamaâs then-attorney general, Eric Holder, advised Mr. Obama that the killing was lawful, as al-Awlaki had encouraged people in the Middle East to fight against American soldiers there. Mr. Holder likened killing al-Awlaki to police shooting at a bank robber they are chasing while he is shooting at them. Mr. Holder forgot that al-Awlaki was unarmed, was not charged with any crime, was never accused of violence, and was not even the subject of an arrest warrant when a drone evaporated him while he sat at an outdoor cafe in Yemen. The exercise of power by the federal government is largely based on precedent and politics. Whenever a president wants to kill, he need only find an example of a predecessor having killed with impunity â without due process, without a declaration of war and without an imminent attack. And then he needs only to calculate what he thinks he can politically get away with. Mr. Biden â whose drones in 2021 destroyed a dam in Syria, killing thousands, and who targeted civilians in Afghanistan, killing dozens, and whose shipments of guns to Ukraine and Israel are killing tens of thousands of people he wants us to hate â is using unlawful powers that his modern predecessors used and got away with to target and kill people he sees as unsympathetic. But the U.S. has not declared war on Russia or Gaza. The nature of political power is to expand so that it fills a perceived need unless there are mechanisms in place to restrain its expansion. The founding generation believed that British monarchs had no limits on their power, and that was a good enough reason for the 13 colonies to violently secede. They also believed that they had crafted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to impose sufficient restraints on the federal government. They believed that the states could peacefully leave a federal government they had voluntarily joined when it exceeded its constitutional powers. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Its language is clear that only Congress writes laws and declares war, and presidents can kill only troops in wartime or civilians consistent with due process. Sadly, the Founders were wrong. Every president takes an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution as it was written, not as he may wish it to be. Yet today, the president writes laws and rules that let him restrain personal liberty and kill with impunity, and Congress and the American people let him get away with it. Formally, we still have a Constitution. Functionally, it has utterly failed to restrain the government. Ultimately, we have ourselves to blame for these killings and undeclared wars. Why do we repose the Constitution for safekeeping into the hands of those who subvert it? If a future president uses Mr. Bushâs lust, Mr. Obamaâs logic and Mr. Bidenâs hatred to kill Americans in America, then no oneâs life, liberty or property will be secure. â¢ To learn more about Judge Andrew Napolitano, visit https://JudgeNap.com.

Monticello Police Chief Britt D. Smith said in a news release that officers were sent to Fareway Meat and Grocery just before 7:30 a.m. Tuesday and found Aaron McAtee, 48, shot outside the store, near a loading dock. He was airlifted to a hospital, where he died. Investigators determined Nathan Russell, 38, of East Dubuque, Illinois, was the suspect and began a search. A Delaware County deputy spotted Russell in the town of Hopkinton, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Monticello. Smith said the deputy shot Russell when he refused to comply with them “in the attempt to detain Russell.” Russell remained hospitalized Wednesday but his condition was not immediately released. The deputy who shot him is on administrative leave while the shooting remains under investigation. Prosecutors were reviewing the case. Monticello, in eastern Iowa, has about 4,000 residents.

(AP) — The Nashville mayor's office called on the city's legal team Monday to investigate the possible unauthorized release of the writings of the shooter who indiscriminately opened fire at the private Nashville school in March, killing three children and three adults before being fatally shot by police. Mayor Freddie O'Connell issued the statement shortly after conservative radio host Steven Crowder released what he said were three images of Audrey Hale's writings from the day of the shooting. Metro Nashville Police Department said Monday the images were not “MNPD crime scene images” and that it was working with Nashville's legal department in the investigation. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation declined to confirm the authentication. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Authorities have not disclosed any of Hale's journals or writings that were collected after the March 27 shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. MNPD initially said they would release the documents, but only after an investigation was officially closed — which could have taken months. In response, groups seeking the documents filed a lawsuit arguing that since the suspect was dead, the records should be immediately released. Police then reversed course, saying that because of the lawsuits they would await the direction of the court on whether to release Hale’s writings. That lawsuit is ongoing. Advertisement Article continues below this ad “I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving,"" O’Connell said. Wally Dietz, Nashville's law director, confirmed in a statement Monday that he was launching the investigation, but said he could not immediately confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents due to the limited information surrounding the “possible leak."" The Associated Press also has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents released Monday. The AP is one of several groups that have requested the writings but is not involved in the lawsuit to obtain them. Attorneys representing families with the Covenant School have repeatedly said they have not seen Hale's writings. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Brent Leatherwood, whose three children attend Covenant School, challenged Crowder and anyone who would amplify the images online to “just be a human for once,” and stop seeking clicks or platform building. Talking to reporters, Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks. “How many people have to be killed in a senseless way so that you can get clicks?” he said. Leatherwood said he received phone calls from parents today upset and worried to even look online at the images: “The damage done today is already significant, and I’m afraid it’s only going to grow.” In May, a chancery court judge ruled that a group of more than 100 Covenant families could intervene in the case. The families say they do not want the police records to be made public, arguing the records will only cause more pain and possibly spark copycats. Advertisement Article continues below this ad An appeals court is now weighing whether that judge acted within the law. Police have said Hale had been planning the massacre for months. Hale fired 152 rounds during the attack before being killed by police. Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder,” police said. However, authorities haven’t disclosed a link between that care and the shooting. The Covenant case is further complicated by the fact that Hale, who was assigned female at birth, seems to have begun identifying as a transgender man – prompting right-wing commentators, politicians and other figures to share false claims of a rise in transgender mass shooters and to suggest that the fight for trans rights is radicalizing people. Authorities’ refusal to release Hale’s writings has fueled further speculation and conspiracy theories about what they might reveal about Hale’s motive or influences.

The three adults were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, custodian Mike Hill, 61, and 61-year-old substitute teacher Cynthia Peak. ___ Associated Press writer Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis, Tennessee."

We’re talking about what happens next, if Issues 1 and 2 pass, on Today in Ohio. Editor Chris Quinn hosts our daily half-hour news podcast, with editorial board member Lisa Garvin, impact editor Leila Atassi and content director Laura Johnston. You’ve been sending Chris lots of thoughts and suggestions on our from-the-newsroom text account, in which he shares what we’re thinking about at cleveland.com. You can sign up here: https://joinsubtext.com/chrisquinn. Here’s what else we’re asking about today: It’s the day. Finally. Ohioans get their say on abortion and marijuana. It could be a day that sends yet another message to the statehouse about how out of touch lawmakers are with their constituents. So, Lisa, let’s start with when the polls close, and then let’s walk about when the abortion amendment and the marijuana law would take effect if they pass? The Cleveland Clinic soars in a recent ranking of patient safety in its hospitals while the other Cleveland systems did not. What are the rankings about, and what grade did the Clinic get? Speaking of the Clinic, we have more on the drones the system will use to deliver prescriptions starting 2025. How far can they go? How much can they actually carry? Were Halloween candy sales down? What’s behind the layoff announcement from Nestle in Solon? The Israel-Hamas war has college campuses in America awash in protests and accusations. But Oberlin College is actually under a federal investigation. What for? Why is Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir, seeking sanctions against Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Mike O’Malley, who was not the prosecutor who handled the case involving her son? As Donald Trump continues to surge in the polls, we keep seeing news of the damage he did on Jan. 6. Who’s the latest Ohioan going to prison for participating in the insurrection? Football fans across America know who the Kelce brothers are, and many know they bothed played in high school at Cleveland Heights. What did the brothers sign off on their alma mater doing to raise some money? Why Is Lennie Stover, a trails advocate, wearing the moniker of Don Quixote in his latest quest?

Because it’s a computer-generated transcript, it contains many errors and misspellings. Chris (00:01.146) When we got through issue one in August, today seemed miles away. And yet here we are election day, November 7th, something we’ll be talking about on Today in Ohio, the news podcast discussion from cleveland.com and the Plain Dealer. Like I said, it’s the day when Ohioans get their say on abortion and marijuana. It could be a day that sends yet another message to our state house about how out of touch the lawmakers are with the constituents. Lisa, let’s start with when the polls close because we want people to go vote. If you haven’t voted, please make time. Stop listening to this podcast. Go to your polling place, go vote. And then Lisa, let’s walk around when the abortion amendment and the marijuana would take effect if they pass. Lisa (00:48.487) Okay, yeah, you have until 7.30 p.m. today to vote. I’ll be doing that as soon as we’re done with this podcast. And as Chris said, please exercise your right to vote. This is a very important election for all Ohioans, no matter how you feel about the issues. So the Ohio Constitution states that citizens initiated constitutional amendments like issue one. and citizen-initiated statutes like issue two generally take effect 30 days after the election, so this would be December 7th. Issue one, the abortion amendment. There are several current abortion laws on the books that may violate the amendment immediately if it’s passed, but these laws must be overturned either in court or repealed by the legislature. Case Western Reserve University retired constitutional law professor, Jonathan Enton says that Clinics could feasibly start providing abortions on December 7th. And they could use the new constitutional language if passed as a defense, if they’re challenged by providing abortions. Now, let’s not forget there was a law signed in 2019, the fetal heartbeat law, that means that anything after six weeks is illegal, but that’s currently being challenged. And so the state argues that clinics have no standing to even bring this lawsuit against the fetal heartbeat law. but how the court decides on the fetal heartbeat law will inform the pro-choice legal strategy going forward. Chris (02:16.878) Although, let’s face it, if you try to enforce any of these laws after the voters, if they approve issue one, approve it, you go into court and you say, well, the Constitution protects me. I mean, I just cannot see process. Well, I can’t say that because we have lunatics in different powers, powerful positions in the state. So a prosecutor, despite the Constitution, could try to enforce the law. But let’s remind people, we have a constitutional amendment on the books in Ohio that prohibits gay marriage. And it’s Lisa (02:28.911) Mm-hmm. Chris (02:44.694) it’s useless, it’s gone because of what the Supreme Court did, but it’s still on the book. So even whether they repeal these laws or not, they’re unenforceable because you have the Constitution on your side. I do suspect though, Lisa, we’ll see a lot of wheedling that the anti-abortion forces, if this passes, will be looking for artificial loopholes to try and make it harder for people to exercise this right. Lisa (03:11.503) Yeah, the one thing I’ve learned through doing the podcast and being on the editorial board is that the Right to Life and Mike Ganodakis, its director, they are very determined, and I don’t think they’re going to go down without a fight. Chris (03:22.578) They’re determined to get rid of the majority rule. I mean, that’s what they’re trying to do, and they always have. On marijuana, the legislature could come into session in a week and start changing that. But depending on how big a margin it passes by, if it passes, there’s political danger in doing so. So we’ll have to see what happens. I do worry that if this passes today, if marijuana passes today, people are going to misinterpret it and think it’s completely legal right now, and they could be prosecuted for doing certain things before the law takes effect, before the election is actually certified. I mean, we have three weeks before the results tonight would even be certified. So. Lisa (04:06.391) Right. And, and that, you know, as far as issue two, you know, they were going to roll out this, you know, a change in statute kind of in phases. So if issue two does pass today, Ohioans can start to grow up to six plants per adult at home, up to 12 maximum per household. They could start doing that December 7th. And dispensaries, now with dispensaries, the state must issue retail permits to existing dispensaries and new ones within nine months. So the coalition to regulate marijuana like alcohol, they’re saying that retail sales for recreational marijuana is possible in as little as 10 months, but they’re really looking at like an August to December, 2024 timeframe. Chris (04:48.914) But here’s my question. I actually ordered hot pepper seeds this morning because I’m going to grow them again in the spring. I haven’t grown them in a few years. But I can’t order marijuana seeds from Burpee, right? So if people want to grow it, where would they even get the seeds? Lisa (05:02.967) Well, and I have some friends that grew some marijuana in their basement a couple years ago, and seeds were very hard to find. It was kind of like a black market thing. It was like someone told somebody and somebody told somebody else, and that’s how they got their seeds. Chris (05:17.146) And I don’t know that the, well, I don’t know, maybe in Michigan they sell the seeds, who knows? We’ll have to figure that out, because I imagine that there are some horticulturists that’ll be like, oh, I can grow marijuana now, I wanna play. We’ll see, all will be known at the end of today about whether recreational marijuana will be legal and whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the Ohio constitution. Please vote, democracy doesn’t work unless you exercise your right. listening to Today in Ohio. The Cleveland Clinic soars in a recent ranking of patient safety in its hospitals, while the other Cleveland systems did not. Laura, what are the rankings about and what grade did the clinic get? laura (06:00.47) These are rankings for patient safety, and it’s from a nonprofit called LeapFrog, and they want to increase patient safety in hospitals. So the clinic earned the most A grades for safety in Greater Cleveland. This is in the fall 2023 hospital safety grades that was released Monday morning. They got high marks for protecting patients for against hospital infections, ensuring effective communication from physicians and nurses, giving clear discharge information, and a bunch of other categories. So LeapFrog, Lisa (06:17.739) They got high marks for protecting patients for against hospital infections, ensuring effective communication with physicians and nurses, giving clear discharge information and a bunch of other categories. So we find FROG assigns letter grades to nearly 3,000 hospitals in the United States, and they want patients to know where to go to protect them from errors, injuries, accidents, infections. laura (06:30.03) Frog assigns letter grades to nearly 3,000 hospitals in the United States, and they want patients to know where to go to protect them from errors, injuries, accidents, infections, when they get a chance to pick a hospital. So not so great other news for other hospitals. SUMA Health, Akron Campus, Metro Health System, University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center, all earned C grades. And these are the first to reflect the hospital performance. Lisa (06:42.243) when they get a chance to pick a hospital. So not so great other news for other hospitals. Suma Health, Akron Campus, Metro Health System, University Hospital, Sleetlal Medical Center, all earn C grade. And these are the first to reflect the hospital performance after the peak of the COVID pandemic. So actually, across the country, rates of healthcare acquired infections improved post-pandemic. That’s good news. The patient experience is considered laura (06:58.47) after the peak of the COVID pandemic. So actually across the country, rates of healthcare acquired infections improved post pandemic, that’s good news, but patient experience continues to worsen and that’s a second year for that trend. Lisa (07:12.821) in the second year for that. Chris (07:15.07) The scariest thing in this story is the number of people who go into the hospital to get cured of something and die as a result. I think it was 200,000 people get things in hospitals, a lot of infections, and die. So these ratings are really important because the last thing you want to do if you go into a hospital is get something worse than what you’re in there for. In the past, people had largely looked at UH as the patient-friendly hospital and the clinic as the technically proficient hospital. Lisa (07:36.251) Give them feedback. laura (07:41.803) Mm-hmm. Lisa (07:42.299) learning at the Tech Machine Physician Hospital. But these ways, they can still count how you give instructions to people when they’re describing that, and how you handle it. But they can still count. So that’s one of the things. Chris (07:45.17) But this has changed. These ratings take into account how you give instructions to people when you’re discharging them and how you handle the patients. And the clinic just did really well. laura (07:57.866) Right, and this is not just the main campus where people come from all over. These are their smaller hospitals as well. All getting As were Fairview, Euclid, Lutheran, Marymount, South Point, Hillcrest, and Avon. So if I have to go to an ER, it’s gonna be Fairview or Avon, right? Like that’s where I would go. There were two B grades that the clinic got. That was Medina and Akron General, which were not originally clinic hospitals, right? But our clinic now. Lisa (07:58.683) And this is not just the main campus where people come from all over. These are their smaller hospitals as well. All getting A’s were Fairview, Euclid, Lutheran, Marymount, South Point, Hillcrest, and Avon. So if I have to go to an ER, it’s going to be Fairview or Avon, right? With dots to where I would go. There were two B grades that the clinic got. That was Medina and Akron General, which were not originally clinic hospitals, right? But are clinics now. UH Parma did earn an A grade. laura (08:25.098) UH Parma did earn an A grade, so if you go to Parma, good for you. There are B grades at TriPoint, Ahuja, and Lake West, but Elyria and Geauga locations got C grades. And just like we said, Metro Health. Metro Health is saying they are doing better, but these leapfrog grades generally lag 18 months behind current results. So... Lisa (08:28.477) good for you. There are B grades in Tri-Point, Cahooja, and Lake West, but Elyria and Geauga locations got D grades. And just like we said, Metro Health. Metro Health is saying they are doing better, but these lead prop grades generally lag 18 months behind. Yeah, but they’re all getting my homework right. Chris (08:42.822) Yeah, the dog ate my homework, right? I mean, come on. laura (08:47.662) Cause that’s from Erica Steed, who is the new MetroHealth CEO. And she has promised to increase patient safety. She’s made that a focus. So hopefully next year, we’re gonna see MetroHealth in this A category, but right now, no. Lisa (08:48.187) because that’s America Seed who is the new MetroHealth CEO. And she has promised to increase patient safety. She’s made that a focus. So hopefully next year we’re gonna see MetroHealth in this A category, but right now, no. Yeah, I think, I mean, we’re waiting for you to do rankings. And you aged in MetroPistons and the clinic did today. And that’s a good sign for the partner to get something. Chris (09:00.502) Yeah, I mean, these are new rankings and UH and Metro get a C and the clinic gets an A and that’s big time for the clinic. That’s something that they can really boast about. This is the serious stuff you care about when you go into a hospital. laura (09:14.85) Yeah, we’re right in the middle of the rankings for states, and we have been there for a while. 25% of Ohio hospitals earned A grades, so 26 in the nation. Lisa (09:15.355) Yeah, we’re right in the middle of the rankings for states. And we have been there for a while. 25% of Ohio hospitals are in eighth grade. So 26% in the main grade. You’re listening to Panay in Ohio. Speaking of the clinic, we have more on the drones. The system was used for the little construction started in 2025. It’s amazing. I believe it’s a real response to the systems that are being used in the United States. And we’re excited to see what the future holds for the system. Chris (09:25.19) You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Speaking of the clinic, we have more on the drones the system will use to deliver prescriptions starting in 2025. It’s amazing. Other readers have really responded. They hate this idea. They think we’ve become a society that demands instantaneous everything and we shouldn’t do it. Although if you have an acute illness, you do want to get your medicine quickly. Well, the video on this thing is fascinating. A reader sent it to us. So we did another story. How far can these drones go and how much can they actually carry? Leila (09:42.2) Huh. Leila (09:54.323) Yeah, Julie followed up on her reporting with this really interesting Q&A that tells us more about how these things will function. And here are some of the highlights. These can cruise along at 70 miles an hour. They can fly in a 10-mile radius or up to 24 miles one way while carrying a six to eight pound payload. As far as safety is concerned, they’re equipped with detect and avoid technology that would help the drone steer clear of obstacles that could pose a hazard. Lisa (10:08.495) and that’s a 10 for minus one way of appearing to six to eight pound payload. As far as safety is concerned, they’re quick to keep track. Leila (10:22.883) A flight operations team monitors each flight as well as weather and air traffic to make sure that it’s safe. And if a critical flight system were to malfunction, its backup would activate automatically and the drones have parachutes for emergency landings. Julie reported in her last story that the drones deploy a cable to deliver their packages. And it turns out that these are so precise in their deployment. Lisa (10:46.615) are so precise in their deployment that they can deliver in any complex space that’s as small as a two foot radius while hovering at 300 feet above their target. That is astonishing. Well, they’re not driving the prescription bad, but we’ve done it before. Leila (10:48.887) that they can deliver in any open space that’s as small as a two-foot radius while hovering at 300 feet above their target. That is astonishing. The drone Chris (11:00.55) Well, they’re not dropping a prescription bag like you get at the pharmacy. There’s a there’s a unit that comes down the cable. It’s pretty technical. And when you they have a 24 hour time lapse video of one of their delivery centers. And my gosh, they slingshot these things into the air. The planes get on this ramp and they fire them into the air. And it’s just one after another, after another, after another. It’s highly technical, technically complex. Leila (11:26.999) This is, it’s so interesting. I mean, they say the drones are really quiet. They’re quieter than passing cars and they can fly in just about any weather condition, extreme cold, wind, rain, snow. And as we suspected, Zipline does not deliver controlled substances or schedule C narcotics and recipients can track their delivery time in real time, which they say would cut back on lost packages or... Lisa (11:28.187) So interesting. I mean, they say the drones are really quiet. They’re quieter than passing cars. And they can fly in just about any weather conditions. They can hold really great stuff. And as we suspected, Timeline does not deliver controlled substances or schedule seed or products. And recipients can track their delivery time. Leila (11:53.323) packages that are intercepted by curious wildlife and stuff like that. But just amazing how accurate these are. I am very curious to see how this works in practice when it’s finally deployed here. Chris (12:08.602) Well, somebody had written and said, I worry about the noise from the base for these things. But there was a video blogger that did a whole takeout on this company. And on while he was recording, he had different things that were making sound. And these drones, you could not hear them. I mean, you could hear everything else, but you really couldn’t hear them. So they are quiet. It’s fascinating that they’re doing it. But man, I did hear from a lot of people that just think this is ridiculous. Leila (12:25.933) Really. Chris (12:37.714) that people have gotten too impatient and that you should go pick up your prescriptions like everybody else. Lisa (12:43.211) Well, I have this vision of somebody like sitting on their back porch with a rifle shooting down drones and taking the drugs. It doesn’t matter. I mean, you know, if you need diabetes drugs, maybe this drone has it. I’ll shoot it down and see. I don’t know. Chris (12:47.622) Ha ha ha. Leila (12:47.81) So. Chris (12:55.334) Yeah Leila (12:55.907) That’s a real crap shoot. I don’t know about that. You’re really taking a gamble. For this purpose, this really could be extremely helpful. I think using drones for Amazon and Walmart deliveries might be a little much, which they have been testing these in some of their markets in the last couple of years. Chris (13:19.118) If you have a mail order prescription you have to get every month or every 90 days, then getting that by mail is perfectly fine. But if you’ve been diagnosed with something acute, that the medicine, the faster you get it into you, the faster you’ll feel better, then getting it to you within 10 minutes is helpful. When you feel terrible, you want to get relief. And so I salute them for what they’re trying to do here to help people out. I can’t wait to watch this in action. It’s going to be interesting. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Lisa, we’re Halloween candy sales down. What’s behind the layoff announcement from Nestle in Solon? Lisa (13:55.915) And actually Nestle and Solon is Stouffer’s, so they don’t make candy there. They make frozen foods there. But Nestle filed a notice with the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services about 77 permanent layoffs at its Solon campus. These layoffs would begin December 31st and go through August of next year. These are mostly office jobs, although they didn’t really provide more details than that. In their statement, Nestle said that, you know, they’re trying to stay ahead of changing market and consumer trends, so make of that what you will. Solon is still an important hub for Nestle. It’s a 60 acre campus. There are 3000 employees there. You can see it if you’re driving on US 422, it’s the Stouffer plant right off of the. the freeway there. They do frozen and chilled foods there. And of course, Stouffer’s is Cleveland based. They were bought by Nestle in 1973. Chris (14:47.418) There seems to be a feeling in corporate America that next year we’re going to have a recession and all sorts of companies seem like they’re making plans for it. You start to wonder if it becomes a fait accompli, that by planning for it and taking these steps, you’re actually creating the recession that you’re predicting. Lisa (15:07.233) And employers across the way are starting to think twice about hiring and layoffs are starting to creep up a little bit. This is only 77 out of 3000 people, so maybe they’re just trying to streamline their operation. It’s hard to say with the few details they provided. Chris (15:22.574) Okay, you’re listening to Today in Ohio. The Israel Hamas war has college campuses in America awash in protests and accusations, but Oberlin College is actually under a federal investigation. Laura, what for? laura (15:36.97) a religion professor is accused of being anti-Semitic. So the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is examining the school, Oberlin, which is known for being incredibly liberal and not just a liberal arts college. It’s this 2019 complaint that alleged that Professor Mohammed Jafar Mahalati said that Israel is a quote, colonialist and an apartheid state. So according to this Office for Civil Rights, the college is being investigated on allegations of breaching Title VI that protects students from being harassed and discriminated because of their religion. So the college learned of this complaint on September 29th, and they say they abhor anti-Semitism and all forms of hate, discrimination, and harassment. And obviously, Oberlin has a reputation for being very accepting, and so this is probably just an anathema to what it stands for. Chris (16:30.99) Yeah, the college campuses really have erupted with quite a few protests. It’s getting a lot of attention. I just, to be actually under federal investigation seems unusual. laura (16:43.902) It is. He’s a presidential scholar in Islamic Studies and he’s on sabbatical this semester while this is going on. They put out a statement and they said, Professor Mahalati has stated he believes in the right of all people to exist in peace and endorse a two-state solution that would allow the people of Israel and Palestine, sorry, Palestine, I’m using the Ohio pronunciation, to peacefully coexist. So that statement obviously does not sound like anti-Semitism. So I don’t know what he originally said. Lisa (16:44.343) It is. He’s a presidential scholar in Islamic studies. And he’s on sabbatical. they put out a statement and they said Professor Mahalati has stated he believes in the right of all people to assist and endorse a two-state solution that will allow the people of Israel and Palestine sorry Palestine, I’m using the wrong pronunciation to be fully co-existed that statement obviously did not sound like antisemitism so I don’t know what you originally said or where this complaint came from Yelissabeta Katenan-Owayo Chris (17:04.24) Yeah. laura (17:12.554) or where this complaint came from students. Chris (17:16.314) You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Why is Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir, so upset with Cuyahoga County prosecutor, Mike O’Malley, who was not the prosecutor who handled the case involving her son? Leila (17:29.171) Samaria Rice says that when Mike O’Malley was running for county prosecutor against his predecessor Tim McGinty, he promised her and other activists that he would re-examine the case of her son’s fatal police shooting. At that time, McGinty had presented the case to a grand jury and the grand jury declined to bring charges against the two officers involved in that, Timothy Loman and Frank Garmback. And O’Malley had refused back then during his campaign to say whether he felt the officers should have been charged. But he definitely accused him again of mishandling the investigation. And that sentiment helped him win the election. Samaria Rice says he told her and others in private meetings that he would reopen the case and he never did. O’Malley says that’s not true. He says he always maintained that the case shouldn’t go back to a grand jury without new evidence. So Samaria Rice was among several people who talked at a news conference this week and called on prosecutors to reopen several past cases of people who were shot or... killed by police in Cuyahoga County and charges were never brought in those cases. Chris (18:33.454) I know Michael Myler pretty well. I’ve been talking to him since he was a city councilman. So it’s more than a quarter century. And we talked to him quite a bit when he was running and he was very clear that he would not reopen this case without new evidence. They had a tour of board talk to him or reporters talk to him. So I’m surprised to hear she’s saying that he had privately said he would because we drilled them about it. We were all over them. Like, what do you mean? You know, you don’t like what McGinty did, but you’re not committing to doing anything new. And he He would say, look, it’s done. If somebody brings me new evidence, I will of course consider it. So I’m not sure where this is coming from. Leila (19:09.311) Yeah, that’s true. I mean, we can’t say what O’Malley promised her behind closed doors. I mean, if that, who knows? But publicly, he definitely managed to walk the tightrope of criticizing McGinty’s handling of it while never committing to a real position on this case. And in doing that, don’t you think he telegraphed to the public that he would have handled it differently? And for a lot of people, that meant that he would have sought justice for Tamir. Lisa (19:09.876) I’m not sure, but we can’t say what it is. All this is going to be very confusing. I just don’t know. Thank you. Chris (19:32.698) Well, no, he did come in and completely change the policy. What he did, and we questioned it, is he put all investigations of police shootings with the attorney general. He said, I feel I have a conflict because my office works with police. I don’t feel I should be investigating people that I work with. And the attorney general does it all. We questioned it because we said, we elect you. You’re the guy. that deals with crimes in Cuyahoga County. And by putting this responsibility elsewhere, that you’re not accountable for it, but he felt strongly about it. And ever since, that’s what’s happened. So I think he did change things when he came in and say, this shouldn’t have been handled by McGinty, it should have been handled by an outsider. Leila (20:22.463) Okay. I mean, that’s true. But it was certainly a politically expedient way to manage that controversy that helped him get elected. I don’t know. I mean, of course, like I said, we can’t... Who knows what kind of conversation Samaria Rice is referring to here. But clearly he got elected because he said McGinty’s handling of this was improper. Chris (20:46.878) Okay, you’re listening to Today in Ohio. As Donald Trump continues to surge in the polls, we keep seeing news of the damage he did on January 6th. It’s been a drumbeat of people getting convicted. Lisa, who’s the latest Ohioan going to prison for participating in Donald Trump’s insurrection? Lisa (21:04.326) He is 33 year old Michael Lockwood of Trumbull County. He received a one year prison sentence in federal prison, a $2,000 restitution payment, and he will have to be supervised for three years after he is released from prison. pled guilty in July to his role in a scuffle with Capitol Police on January 6th of 2021 at a Stop the Steal rally. Lockwood never did enter the Capitol building, but what happened was he resisted officers orders for him to leave the area. A fella nearby tried to help Lockwood by hitting officers with a flagpole, and when the officers turned their attention to the flagpole guy, um... One of them pulled out a police baton, which Lockwood wrestled away from the officer and then ran off. He later bragged about this and he sent photos to a friend of his little souvenir from the riot. He was ID’d via online video, Facebook, and facial recognition, and apparently his grandma fingered him as well. His attorney Samuel Moore says Lockwood was not a long-term partisan zealot. He never intended to harm officers and he has regret and sympathy. for officers who went through physical and emotional trauma on that day. Prosecutors wanted two years and three months in prison. The defense wanted just home detention or six months maximum in prison. Chris (22:25.654) He joins the ranks of the dumbest criminals you’ve ever seen. People who break the law and then openly publicize that they broke the law. These are the kind of people Trump attracts. Morons who break the law and then say, look at me, look at me, police, I broke the law. So of course he’s going to prison. What an idiot. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Football fans across America know who the Kelsey brothers are and many know they both played in high school at Cleveland Heights High. What did the brothers sign off on for their alma mater to raise some money, Laura? laura (23:00.47) Row back jerseys, number 48 for Jason, number one for Travis. As far as I know, there is no Swift jersey in the mix, but they have youth sizes, a men’s cut, and a woman’s cut, which is perfect for any Swifties in your life. And that’s from Heights Athletic Boosters co-founder Chrissy Dietrich Gallagher. There’s a separate fundraiser with the Heights Schools Foundation from their mom Donna, who has her own t-shirt fundraiser. But this was the idea of the boosters, along with high school teacher Mark Saks. who knows the Kelsey Brothers well enough to call them and by the end of the day, had their okay to sell these jerseys, you can get them through November 14th as the last day you can place your order and then pick them up December 5th. They run from 50 to $55. And my guess is these are gonna be really popular Christmas or holiday presents for anybody in the Cleveland area. Chris (23:55.27) How rare is this? Were people able to buy LeBron James high school jersey as a throwback too? Is this something that athletes do now? They help their high schools raise money by letting them sell their high school jerseys? laura (24:02.946) That’s a- laura (24:08.566) That’s a very good question. I have never seen, just running around Akron, a lot of kids wearing a Saint V 23 jersey, but hey, Saint V could do it now too. There’s no expiration date on this idea. It sounds like a great one. I mean, it’s not overly expensive for a gift for someone. And the Boosters is a fairly new, it’s the brainchild of four Cleveland Heights, University Heights, school district parents, and they. Lisa (24:16.829) But hey, we could do it now too. There’s no expiration date on this idea. It sounds like a great one. I mean, it’s not overly expensive or a gift for someone. And the Booster is fairly new. It’s the breakout of four Cleveland High schoolers. They have two different parents, and they want to address the... laura (24:34.89) want to address the needs they see in various school sports. So they got the senior banners for their fall sports student athletes up around the campus at the football field and where else they play, which is great. A lot of schools do that. But they raised money so the kids and their families didn’t have to pay for it. And they want to do bigger capital funding projects like a new scoreboard at Roxborough and more bleachers at the high school baseball field because apparently it’s tough to see there. So it’s a great cause. It’s a good idea. And I’m glad that Kelsey Brothers are on board. Lisa (24:36.207) They see it in various reports. They got the senior banners for their fall sports student athletes up around the campus, at the football field, and where else they play, which is great. A lot of schools do that. But they raise money so the kids and their families didn’t have to pay for it. And they want to do bigger capital funding projects. They’re getting scoreboard at Roxborough and more features at the high school baseball field, because apparently it’s tough to see there. So it’s a great cause. It’s a good idea. And I’m glad the Kelsey brothers are on board. Chris (25:05.414) It was nice that they did that. They didn’t have to sign off and it was nice that they’re supporting their high school. Lisa (25:06.241) they didn’t have to sign off. Right, they’re not getting a commission on this. It’s all going to the pool. It wasn’t until today in Ohio. Why don’t we still build a field after this, bring the monitor up next to the building, so we can press it. laura (25:09.374) Right, they’re not getting a commission on this. This is all going to the schools. Chris (25:13.298) You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Why is Lenny Stover, a trails advocate wearing the moniker of Don Quixote in his latest quest, Layla? Leila (25:22.683) Steve Litt brings us the story of Lenny Stover. He’s a longtime civic volunteer and a trails advocate who, much like Don Quixote, is a visionary who has really held onto a dream. And in Stover’s case, that dream is of seeing the Cleveland Metro Park’s Red Line Greenway extended from the city’s west side to downtown across the viaduct. This two-mile greenway was completed in 2021 along the Red Line tracks west of the river, but it now ends several hundred feet shy. of where the viaduct rises to cross over the water. There’s a fence that blocks the way. Trail users have to go downhill to this curving path that cuts under the concrete arches of the viaduct. And that trail leads to Franklin Avenue, the Lakeland Trail, and the future Irish town, Bend Park, that’s under construction now. And everyone loves the greenway, but Stover doesn’t think it’s finished. Stover now wants to see the greenway extended another Lisa (26:04.731) And that trail leads to Franklin Avenue, the Lakeland Trail, and the future Irish trail, Ben Park, that’s under construction. Everyone loves the greenway, but Stoddard doesn’t think it’s finished. Stoddard now wants to see the high-extended another 2,200 feet elevated RTA viaduct across the river from Ohio City to the northwest corner of town city center. And this is an idea that’s similar to that of New York’s Highland, which is converted, Leila (26:19.499) on the elevated RTA viaduct across the river from Ohio City to the northwest corner of Tower City Center. This is an idea that’s similar to that of New York’s High Line, which is a converted and unused elevated rail line in the lower west side of Manhattan into this park that attracts tons of visitors and has really spurred a real estate boom in New York. Lisa (26:34.705) in the unused elevated rail lines below this item. And it happens in this park that attracts tons of visitors and is really spurred of real estate in New York. Specifically, in the park, Leila (26:47.259) India birdsong Terry of RTA told him to go ahead and raise $100,000 for a feasibility study and she’ll be ready to hear the results. And Grace Galucci of NOACA, which oversees all the federal spending and transportation projects in our region, said she’s interested too. She’ll listen when he has something to offer. But I just thought what makes this such a great story is Stover himself, this retired investment advisor and an independent contractor who’s just had this project in his sights for decades. and is fighting for it all on his own. He’s even spent several thousand dollars of his own money to develop a new promotional video for this project. Chris (27:27.258) I just hope that if we get there that it’s funded with private donations. We have a lot of expensive needs in our region. We carried a letter to the editor today which is saying, hey, how can we be talking about all this lakefront development when we have all these needs that we can’t afford? And it’s a good point. We don’t have enough money for the crises that we face in this region. And we keep coming up with these recreational ideas saying, oh, wouldn’t this be great? And yeah, it would be great. Leila (27:44.598) is. Chris (27:56.038) But we don’t have any money. Leila (27:57.507) That’s true. Yeah, the reader is absolutely right. But it is interesting though to have someone like this, just someone who’s so obsessed with seeing improvement in their city that they just never give up. We need more people like that, I think, and then perhaps the private investment will come. Chris (28:01.967) Yeah, we... Chris (28:18.754) Yeah, I love the ideas. It’s just, we need a jail, we need a justice center, we need to deal with problems involving youth and we just don’t have any more money. We’re taxed to death as it is. So how do you pay for it all? You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Again, please go vote. Thanks Lisa, thanks Leila, thanks Laura. Thanks to everybody who listens. We’ll be back Wednesday talking about the election results from your voting. Lisa (28:34.619) Thank you for listening to Sinead Ohio. Again, please go vote. Thanks for your attention. Thanks to everyone who listened. We’ll be back Wednesday talking about the election results."
"Man killed after pointing gun at Baltimore police, officials say",2023-11-07,2023-11-08T07:31:00Z,en,sandiegouniontribune.com,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-11-07/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108073100id_/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-11-07/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108073100/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-11-07/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNhbmRpZWdvdW5pb250cmlidW5lKS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTExLTA3L21hbi1raWxsZWQtYWZ0ZXItcG9pbnRpbmctZ3VuLWF0LWJhbHRpbW9yZS1wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXNheQ~~,"Man killed after pointing gun at Baltimore police, officials say Baltimore police officers shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them following a foot pursuit Tuesday afternoon, officials said. Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed. Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said. One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasnât the case, Worley said. Officials havenât determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also havenât determined whether the armed man fired his handgun. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasnât been released. The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Departmentâs specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they donât wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said.

Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed. Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said. One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasn't the case, Worley said. Officials haven't determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also haven't determined whether the armed man fired his handgun. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasn't been released. The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Department's specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence.

Baltimore Police fatally shoot man who they say pointed gun at officers Tuesday afternoon in Millhill,2023-11-07,2023-11-08T04:46:21Z,en,baltimoresun.com,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-baltimore-police-shooting-20231107-3fcapoa5rzhdref2e4bhd35f6q-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108044621id_/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-baltimore-police-shooting-20231107-3fcapoa5rzhdref2e4bhd35f6q-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108044621/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-baltimore-police-shooting-20231107-3fcapoa5rzhdref2e4bhd35f6q-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bikvbmV3cy9icy1tZC1iYWx0aW1vcmUtcG9saWNlLXNob290aW5nLTIwMjMxMTA3LTNmY2Fwb2E1cnpoZHJlZjJlNGJoZDM1ZjZxLXN0b3J5Lmh0bWw~,"Police fatally shot a man who they said pointed a gun at officers while fleeing in Southwest Baltimore, Police Commissioner Richard Worley said Tuesday afternoon. The man, who police said they have not identified yet, was pronounced dead at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. Two neighborhood residents who said they witnessed the shooting Tuesday said the victim was their brother Hunter Jessup. Worley said officers from the Southwest District Action Team were patrolling Brunswick Street in the Millhill neighborhood at 12:35 p.m. Tuesday when they tried to stop a man because they believed he was armed. “They saw something that made them believe he was armed,” Worley said. When asked for details about the stop, Worley said he did not want to call the neighborhood “a high-crime area,” but said there had been several shootings nearby and that officers were doing “proactive patrol.” The man fled onto the 2600 block of Wilkens Avenue, and officers chased him on foot, police said. After the man drew a gun, an officer tackled him onto a set of steps. The man turned and pointed his weapon at officers, and “multiple officers” then opened fire, after warning him to drop his weapon, Worley said. Officers rendered aid immediately after shooting the man, the commissioner said. He said police recovered a handgun with an extended magazine from the scene and said it wasn’t clear yet whether the man had fired at officers. An officer had “blood on his pants” and initially thought he had been shot but was not, Worley said. The officer was treated at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center and released. After an officer shot a 17-year-old in Southwest Baltimore’s Shipley Hill neighborhood in May, Baltimore Police declined to answer questions about what the characteristics of an armed person are and whether the department evaluates how often officers are incorrect in their suspicions. In response to that shooting, Baltimore defense attorney Natalie Finegar said the phrase armed person is police terminology created to justify stopping people on a “hunch,” which is not otherwise legal. A police spokesperson said the department is reviewing body camera footage from Tuesday’s shooting, and that it was too early in the investigation to say how many officers shot at the man or how many shots were fired. The Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland Office of the Attorney General, which investigates deadly interactions with police, was at the scene Tuesday, spokesperson Thomas Lester said. Speaking at the scene, Mayor Brandon Scott said: “We know that incidents like these really pull the heart out of the community. ... This again points to the bigger and broader issue about the flow of guns into our city and how we cannot have individuals just walking around with these weapons that can lead to incidents like today. It’s very unfortunate.” One of the witnesses, Kahlil Hardy, said the shooting occurred in front of his house. Hardy, 24, said he came to his door when he heard the shots and saw “at least three or four” officers fire at Jessup, who he said had just returned from a stint in prison. “That wasn’t his,” Hardy said of the gun police said they recovered. Police had placed 59 evidence markers at the scene. “What I’m trying to understand is how are there 50 shell casings?” Hardy said. “I’m going to cry, bro.” Jevelon Nolley, 24, said he and his brother Hunter were at the corner of Brunswick and St. Benedict streets when two officers in police vests pulled up in an unmarked car. ”They harass us 24/7,” Nolley said. “This is every day.” Nolley said police told them to lift their shirts to show they didn’t have a “bulge” from a weapon. He said they lifted their shirts, then asked police what probable cause they had to stop them. Nolley also said Jessup was unarmed. As officers questioned them, his brother took off running around the corner onto Wilkens, Nolley said. Police cordoned off a crime scene between Millington Avenue and Brunswick. “He’s seen some stuff where a police officer killed someone else in his life,” Nolley said. Nolley said police fired at Jessup as he ran away, estimating officers fired 15 to 16 shots, hitting him 10 times. His brother was taken to the hospital, he said. Nolley called Jessup a “stand-up guy,” and said he lives in the neighborhood where the shooting happened and has a baby on the way."

Are Vallejo officers using force more often than they used to?,2023-11-07,2023-11-08T02:00:54Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/07/are-vallejo-officers-using-force-more-often-than-they-used-to/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108020054id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/07/are-vallejo-officers-using-force-more-often-than-they-used-to/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108020054/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/07/are-vallejo-officers-using-force-more-often-than-they-used-to/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzExLzA3L2FyZS12YWxsZWpvLW9mZmljZXJzLXVzaW5nLWZvcmNlLW1vcmUtb2Z0ZW4tdGhhbi10aGV5LXVzZWQtdG8~,"The Vallejo Police Department has spent the past several years working to ensure its officers resort to using force only when strictly necessary. But the agency’s new data tracking system – which aims to capture more thorough information on use-of-force arrests – makes it impossible to tell whether this effort has been successful. Police data released last month appears to show a massive increase in Vallejo officers using weapons like batons, Tasers and projectile launchers to arrest people. Reported use-of-force incidents soared from 38 in all of 2022 to 198 as of the end of September – a more than fivefold increase. Reported control holds skyrocketed from two in 2022 to 92 in the first nine months of 2023. The number of takedowns that police reported likewise jumped from 16 to 91. The numbers appear to fly in the face of the California Department of Justice’s attempts to curb excessive force in a police department infamous for its strained and sometimes violent relationship with its community. In a Monday press release, Vallejo police clarified what had happened. Even though the VPD displayed its 2023 data side by side with data from 2022, changes in how the agency measures use-of-force incidents mean that comparing the two years is difficult. For instance, while the previous numbers only included control holds where the suspect made a complaint about pain or injury, the current numbers list all control holds regardless of their outcome. “Due to this significant change in UOF criteria and data collection metrics, the department is informing the public that a month-to-month or year-to-year comparison using two separate processes and criteria can be confusing,” the VPD said. “As we continue to collect this data in this manner, a more direct comparison can be made using 2023 data compared to 2024 data.” As of last year, according to police, Vallejo officers were using force much less frequently than they used to. Reported use-of-force incidents decreased by 62% between 2020, when the DOJ began oversight of Vallejo police, and 2022. A substantial portion of the police force quit, retired or was fired during that period. While the current data reveals little, outrage over Vallejo officers’ reliance on force has dominated many recent public meetings. Activists swamped Vallejo City Hall in September to protest the return of Det. Jarrett Tonn, who killed 22-year-old Sean Monterrosa while he was unarmed and reportedly on his knees in 2020. The Solano County chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is currently weighing options to hold Vallejo officers accountable for past misconduct concerning uses of force and has hosted two lively town hall meetings on the topic in recent months. Additionally, the California DOJ last month accused Vallejo officers of violating the U.S. Constitution by “using unreasonable force.” Vallejo’s first officer-involved shooting since Monterrosa’s death also took place this June during a burglary at a Springs Road gas station."

In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Oakland police said the sergeant “encountered an armed individual who approached the sergeant’s vehicle” as he was en route to work. Police said the details about why the sergeant fired or when “will be part of the investigation into this (shooting).” The sergeant has been placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy. Police did not identify the sergeant. Earlier Tuesday, Officer Kim Armstead, a public information officer with Oakland police, confirmed that police responded to the 300 block of Frank Ogawa Plaza after receiving a gunshot-detection alert just before 4 a.m. Tuesday. Upon arrival, the officers found a person suffering from a gunshot wound, and that person was later pronounced dead at the scene.

Armstead said “the officer involved in this shooting was not physically injured.” Police in their statement said they recovered a gun and multiple casings of different calibers at the scene. The person died despite treatment from arriving officers, police said. Police did not answer any questions about the shooting. In a statement issued just before 9 a.m. Tuesday, the Oakland Police Officers’ Association said that a veteran officer was “confronted by an armed individual who opened fire” as he started his shift near City Hall. The union said the officer drew his weapon and fired in response to the gunfire. “We are thankful for our officer’s safety and equally relieved that community members were not injured during the incident,” union President Barry Donelan wrote..

Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed. Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said. One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasnât the case, Worley said. Officials havenât determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also havenât determined whether the armed man fired his handgun. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasnât been released. The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Departmentâs specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they donât wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said. The teams drew scrutiny earlier this year after a police shooting that unfolded under similar circumstances and left a teen in critical condition â less than a mile from the scene of Tuesdayâs shooting. In that case, too, officers tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was carrying a gun. He ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. In this case as in the previous shooting, Worley defended the officersâ actions. He said they were conducting âproactive patrolsâ aimed at preventing violence. He also said they yelled at the man multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire. âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said during a news conference at the scene. âWe donât know what he was up to with that weapon.â Department policy says officers are allowed to use deadly force when they believe itâs âimmediately necessaryâ to protect another officer or civilian from âimminent danger of death or serious physical injury.â In the case of a fleeing suspect, officers can use deadly force to prevent the person from escaping under certain circumstances. âWhile we are very early in this investigation, we know that incidents like this really pull the heart out of the community,â said Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, thanking city police officers for what they do. But praise for the cityâs police department has been hard to come by in recent years. The agency has implemented significant reform measures under a federal consent decree established in 2017 that mandates a series of court-ordered changes to eliminate unconstitutional policing practices and improve community trust. The agreement was reached after the U.S. Justice Department discovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing. The DOJ investigation was launched after Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries in Baltimore police custody. Not long after the consent decree was announced, the Gun Trace Task Force scandal revealed abuse and corruption inside an elite plainclothes unit. An assessment earlier this year found officers are significantly less likely to use force against members of the public than they were before the consent decree was put in place."

Mayor Freddie O’Connell issued the statement shortly after conservative radio host Steven Crowder released what he said were three images of Audrey Hale’s writings from the day of the shooting. Metro Nashville Police Department said Monday the images were not “MNPD crime scene images” and that it was working with Nashville’s legal department in the investigation. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation declined to confirm the authentication. Authorities have not disclosed any of Hale’s journals or writings that were collected after the March 27 shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. MNPD initially said they would release the documents, but only after an investigation was officially closed — which could have taken months. In response, groups seeking the documents filed a lawsuit arguing that since the suspect was dead, the records should be immediately released. Police then reversed course, saying that because of the lawsuits they would await the direction of the court on whether to release Hale’s writings. That lawsuit is ongoing. “I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving,” O’Connell said. Wally Dietz, Nashville’s law director, confirmed in a statement Monday that he was launching the investigation, but said he could not immediately confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents due to the limited information surrounding the “possible leak.” The Associated Press also has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents released Monday. The AP is one of several groups that have requested the writings but is not involved in the lawsuit to obtain them. Attorneys representing families with the Covenant School have repeatedly said they have not seen Hale’s writings. Brent Leatherwood, whose three children attend Covenant School, challenged Crowder and anyone who would amplify the images online to “just be a human for once,” and stop seeking clicks or platform building. Talking to reporters, Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks. “How many people have to be killed in a senseless way so that you can get clicks?” he said. Leatherwood said he received phone calls from parents today upset and worried to even look online at the images: “The damage done today is already significant, and I’m afraid it’s only going to grow.” In May, a chancery court judge ruled that a group of more than 100 Covenant families could intervene in the case. The families say they do not want the police records to be made public, arguing the records will only cause more pain and possibly spark copycats. An appeals court is now weighing whether that judge acted within the law. Police have said Hale had been planning the massacre for months. Hale fired 152 rounds during the attack before being killed by police. Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder,” police said. However, authorities haven’t disclosed a link between that care and the shooting. The Covenant case is further complicated by the fact that Hale, who was assigned female at birth, seems to have begun identifying as a transgender man – prompting right-wing commentators, politicians and other figures to share false claims of a rise in transgender mass shooters and to suggest that the fight for trans rights is radicalizing people. Authorities’ refusal to release Hale’s writings has fueled further speculation and conspiracy theories about what they might reveal about Hale’s motive or influences. The three children who were killed in the shooting were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. The three adults were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, custodian Mike Hill, 61, and 61-year-old substitute teacher Cynthia Peak. ___ Associated Press writer Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis, Tennessee.

An unknown number of officers were in the area of 7th and Grayson Streets around 5:25 a.m. investigating a suspected vehicle burglary in progress when they encountered three adult suspects, police said while speaking to reporters Monday. Officers eventually opened fire on the suspects, hitting one person, according to authorities. After life-saving measures were attempted, the person was later pronounced dead at Highland Hospital. Police did not reveal whether the suspects fired any shots in the exchange, or whether they were armed with a weapon, citing an open investigation into the incident. When asked why the officers felt the need to open fire, a police spokesperson said she didn’t have that information. At the scene, a Ford truck was seen adjacent to a police vehicle with at least one bullet hole in the driver’s side window. Two arrests were made at the scene and no officers were injured, according to authorities. Authorities did not immediately release the identity of the person killed. In September, five Berkeley officers fatally shot 24-year-old Lamar Walker after he killed the mother of his 7-year-old child, before an apparent attempt to take his own life at the Toyota of Berkeley Service Center in just over the city border in Albany. When police found him, he allegedly pointed a revolver at officers before they opened fire."

(AP) — The Nashville mayor’s office called on the city’s legal team Monday to investigate the possible unauthorized release of the writings of the shooter who indiscriminately opened fire at the private Nashville school in March, killing three children and three adults before being fatally shot by police. Mayor Freddie O’Connell issued the statement shortly after conservative radio host Steven Crowder released what he said were three images of Audrey Hale’s writings from the day of the shooting. Metro Nashville Police Department said Monday the images were not “MNPD crime scene images” and that it was working with Nashville’s legal department in the investigation. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation declined to confirm the authentication. Authorities have not disclosed any of Hale’s journals or writings that were collected after the March 27 shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. MNPD initially said they would release the documents, but only after an investigation was officially closed — which could have taken months. In response, groups seeking the documents filed a lawsuit arguing that since the suspect was dead, the records should be immediately released. Police then reversed course, saying that because of the lawsuits they would await the direction of the court on whether to release Hale’s writings. That lawsuit is ongoing. “I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving,” O’Connell said. Wally Dietz, Nashville’s law director, confirmed in a statement Monday that he was launching the investigation, but said he could not immediately confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents due to the limited information surrounding the “possible leak.” The Associated Press also has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents released Monday. The AP is one of several groups that have requested the writings but is not involved in the lawsuit to obtain them. Attorneys representing families with the Covenant School have repeatedly said they have not seen Hale’s writings. Brent Leatherwood, whose three children attend Covenant School, challenged Crowder and anyone who would amplify the images online to “just be a human for once,” and stop seeking clicks or platform building. Talking to reporters, Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks. “How many people have to be killed in a senseless way so that you can get clicks?” he said. Leatherwood said he received phone calls from parents today upset and worried to even look online at the images: “The damage done today is already significant, and I’m afraid it’s only going to grow.” In May, a chancery court judge ruled that a group of more than 100 Covenant families could intervene in the case. The families say they do not want the police records to be made public, arguing the records will only cause more pain and possibly spark copycats. An appeals court is now weighing whether that judge acted within the law. Police have said Hale had been planning the massacre for months. Hale fired 152 rounds during the attack before being killed by police. Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder,” police said. However, authorities haven’t disclosed a link between that care and the shooting. The Covenant case is further complicated by the fact that Hale, who was assigned female at birth, seems to have begun identifying as a transgender man – prompting right-wing commentators, politicians and other figures to share false claims of a rise in transgender mass shooters and to suggest that the fight for trans rights is radicalizing people. Authorities’ refusal to release Hale’s writings has fueled further speculation and conspiracy theories about what they might reveal about Hale’s motive or influences. The three children who were killed in the shooting were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. The three adults were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, custodian Mike Hill, 61, and 61-year-old substitute teacher Cynthia Peak. ___ Associated Press writer Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis, Tennessee."

Nashville shooter Audrey Hale’s alleged writings surface: ‘Wanna kill all you little crackers’,2023-11-06,2023-11-07T07:11:47Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/06/news/nashville-shooter-audrey-hales-alleged-writings-surface-wanna-kill-all-you-little-crackers/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107071147id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/06/news/nashville-shooter-audrey-hales-alleged-writings-surface-wanna-kill-all-you-little-crackers/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107071147/https://nypost.com/2023/11/06/news/nashville-shooter-audrey-hales-alleged-writings-surface-wanna-kill-all-you-little-crackers/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wNi9uZXdzL25hc2h2aWxsZS1zaG9vdGVyLWF1ZHJleS1oYWxlcy1hbGxlZ2VkLXdyaXRpbmdzLXN1cmZhY2Utd2FubmEta2lsbC1hbGwteW91LWxpdHRsZS1jcmFja2Vycw~~,"Alleged writings of Nashville mass killer Audrey Hale’s have been released by conservative commentator Steven Crowder, which appear to reveal the shooter’s anti-white hatred and nervous but resolute planning. The three handwritten pages were posted on Crowder’s web site, which asserted their legitimacy, saying they had been obtained by his MugClub Undercover investigative unit. Nashville Metropolitan Police Department, who led the investigation into the shootings, said they were aware of the documents and were investigating, but clarified in a statement: “The photographs are not MNPD crime scene images.” Hale, 28, who identified as transgender and also went by the name Aiden, allegedly wrote in one of the missives: “Wanna kill all you little crackers,” before murdering three children and three adults at the Christian school, which Hale had once attended, in March. It is well known that Hale had produced a volume of writing before launching the attack. Police said they had found twenty journals, five laptops, a suicide note and various other notes written by Hale at the house she shared with her parents as well as two memoirs, five Covenant School yearbooks and seven cellphones, according to a search warrant. It is unclear which part of Hale’s alleged writings were represented in the three images released by Crowder, but one of them is dated on the same day as the shooting took place, March 27. Officials and some of the victims’ relatives have strenuously sought to block the release of the written materials, arguing that doing so would incite copycat crimes and deepen the trauma of those impacted. But media outlets and some police associations initiated ongoing lawsuits pushing for the full release of the document. Dated February 3, 2023 — just weeks before the shooting — one page takes aim at affluent children “with their white privlages.” “Those crackers, going to private fancy schools with those fancy kwakis [sic] and sports backpacks,” Hale allegedly wrote. “W/thier daddies mustangs and convertibles. F— you little s—-. I wish to shoot you weakass d—- w/your mop yellow hair.” Hale once attended the school she targeted, police said after the massacre. Arriving cops shot him dead inside the building. On a page titled “DEATH DAY” — decorated with a picture of a gun and doodles — Hale allegedly wrote that he was “a little nervous, but excited too.” “Can’t believe I’m doing this, but I’m ready,” Hale wrote. “God let my wrath take over my anxiety…I hope I have a high death count.” Hale also indicated that the killings could have been prevented. “There were several times I could have been caught, especially back in the summer of 2021,” the page states. Another page outlines Hale’s plans for the day of the attack in detail: 7:00am – Get dressed [unreadable] 7:05am – 8:55am – [unreadable] w/ stuffed animals + possessions 9:00am – Eat breakfast at home 9:30am – Pack up special belongings in backpack(s) -9:50am – test knifecor glass breaker (dads old cars) 10:00am – Leave for Royal Range (19-20 min) 10:20am – Gear up + setup guns in trunk (assemble) + get out rest (w/ mags inside) 11:20am – Final video tape (0 min) (11:30) 11:35am – Leave for Covenant school 12:00pm – Arrive at Covenant (Check parking lot for security) 12:05 – arrive in designated parking space 12:05-12:10 – prepare for attack 12:– – Lock + load all weapons 12:33 [circled] Open fire towards SW entrance Let massacre begin Time2die XXX Students Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9, were shot dead, along with school custodian Mike Hill, 61, substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61, and headmistress Katherine Koonce, 60. The Metro Nashville Police Department remains in possession and control of the full manifesto. The agency has also pledged a full probe into the alleged pages. In opposing a timely publicizing of Hale’s writings, the agency has repeatedly argued the papers are part of an ongoing investigation."
