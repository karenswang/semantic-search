'Daniel's Law' supported at Manhasset rally seeking change in police response to mental health crises,10/1/23,2023-10-04T04:39:51Z,en,newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/long-island/whitney-pond-park-manhasset-daniels-law-mszq6hcp,https://web.archive.org/web/20231004043951id_/https://www.newsday.com/long-island/whitney-pond-park-manhasset-daniels-law-mszq6hcp,https://web.archive.org/web/20231004043951/https://www.newsday.com/long-island/whitney-pond-park-manhasset-daniels-law-mszq6hcp,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG5ld3NkYXkpL2xvbmctaXNsYW5kL3doaXRuZXktcG9uZC1wYXJrLW1hbmhhc3NldC1kYW5pZWxzLWxhdy1tc3pxNmhjcA~~,"Advocates in Manhasset on Sunday rallied for state legislation requiring experts on handling people in a mental or substance abuse crisis respond to certain 911 calls before police officers.  The bill, known as “Daniel’s Law,” is sponsored by a pair of Rochester Democrats, State Sen. Samra Brouk and Assemb. Harry Bronson. They took up the bill after Daniel Prude, 41, in March 2020 and experiencing a mental health crisis, died in police custody in Rochester.  Rebecca Bonanno, who helped organize Sunday’s event at Whitney Pond Park — timed to coincide with what would have been Prude’s 45th birthday — said the legislation would “create a public health response to the types of crisis that put vulnerable people at risk of force, involuntary hospitalization and even death.”  The rally was organized by LI United to Transform Policing and Community Safety, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Social Justice Committee of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock.  Brouk, at a news conference announcing the bill earlier this year, said: “Every day people living with mental illness are stigmatized and abused by a system that is designed to criminalize their weakest moments. It’s clear that there’s a lack of understanding and support when it comes to responding to mental health crises.”  Sign up for the NewsdayTV newsletter From breaking news to special features and documentaries, the NewsdayTV team is covering the issues that matter to you.

The Suffolk County Police Department’s public information office said the department has introduced several necessary reforms in recent years.  The Suffolk Police Communication Section launched a 911 diversion pilot program as part of its police reform plan in 2021 that has since been implemented departmentwide.  As part of the program, operators evaluate if a caller experiencing a behavioral health crisis would be better served by a mental health professional using telehealth.  If a person is determined to be violent, or if a psychiatric transport is necessary, then police respond, according to information provided by the department.  The Suffolk Police Department said it also provides incoming officers with more mental health training hours than required by state law. More than 420 officers have completed crisis intervention training since 2019, according to the police.  Organizers at the rally Sunday also held an afternoon candlelight vigil in honor of 55 people suffering a mental illness who have been killed by police in New York. The list was compiled from a Washington Post database that has tracked fatal police shootings since 2015.  “Mental health and substance use disorders are medical issues, not criminal justice issues,” said Susan Gottehrer, director of the Nassau County New York Civil Liberties Union. “We need to start talking about this differently.”"

Around 7:41 a.m., the Antioch Police Department was investigating a suspicious vehicle on the 200 block of West Third Street, according to a press release. Inside the vehicle, officers found a man with a firearm.  Police said they “gave commands” to the individual, who refused to comply. He unsuccessfully attempted to flee in his car and ultimately fled the scene on foot with the firearm in hand.  Officers shot the man, who was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive. The man had a warrant out for his arrest for a homicide earlier this year in Antioch. Police declined to release the man’s name, as well as the names of the officers, citing an active investigation. All of the officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave."

The AGâs Office of Special Investigations, which probes incidents where law enforcement officers may have caused the death of a person, concluded that Suffolk Police Officer Raymond Stock shot and killed Enrique Lopez, 56.Â Lopez stabbed Stock and another officer who responded to his apartment after his roommate alleged he threatened him with a fire extinguisher and was acting erratically, the OSI report said.Â âIn sum, the evidence in the investigation is insufficient to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Stock was justified under New York law in using deadly physical force,â the report reads. âTherefore, OSI will not seek charges and closes the investigation with this report.â The family of Lopez, who the report said suffered from an unnamed mental illness, could not be reached for comment. The police department declined comment. WHAT TO KNOW - No criminal charges will be filed in the fatal Suffolk police shooting of a Medford man who stabbed two officers during an encounter in his home last year,Â a report released Friday from the office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James says. - The AGâs Office of Special Investigations concluded that Suffolk Police Officer Raymond Stock shot and killed Enrique Lopez, 56.Â - Lopez stabbed Stock and another officer who responded to his apartment after his roommate alleged he threatened him with a fire extinguisher and was acting erratically, theÂ report said.Â OSI said it reviewed evidence from the scene, police radio transmissions and interviewed witnesses â including Stock and Officers Brenden Gallagher, who was also stabbed by Lopez, and Michael Livorio â as part of its investigation. OSI also reviewed a videoÂ of the encounter between Lopez and the officers, although the video, which was shot inadvertently by Lopezâs case manager, does not showÂ visible images of the shooting or stabbings. The report noted that none of the officers were wearing body cameras at the time, but the department has since âfully implementedâ its body worn camera program. At the time of the shooting, the police department refused to release the name of the officers involved or who fired the fatal shot. But Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison called it a âjustified shootingâ when speaking to reporters. âOfficer Stock said he fired his gun to save Officer Gallagher,â the OSI report said. âOfficer Stock realized he was bleeding and went downstairs and later was airlifted to Stony Brook University Medical Center. Officer Stock said he is in physical therapy and is not cleared for work.â Lopez lived for five years before his Dec. 28, 2022 death in an apartment operated by Concern Housing, a nonprofit for people with disabilities and mental health issues, the report said. Lopezâs case manager, who was not identified by name, called 911 after she said Lopez had threatened a roommate with a fire extinguisher, was acting âirrationallyâ and exhibiting âvery odd, dangerous behavior,â the report said. She also described Lopez as paranoid and violent.Â Police arrived at Lopezâs apartment at 5:03 p.m. and officers reported that shots were fired at 5:09 p.m., the report said. Stock and Gallagher entered Lopezâs bedroom, while Livorio stood nearby. âHey Enrique â¦ whatâs going on today?â Stock can be heard asking on the video, according to the report. The sounds of a struggle can then be heard and then four shots. The report said when Stock and Gallagher entered Lopezâs room to speak to him, Stock told investigators Lopez was sitting on the bed with an âaggressive postureâ and was leaning forward and clenching his fists. Gallagher described Lopez as âagitated and stiff,"" the report said.Â Stock told investigators that he and Gallagher both grabbed Lopez by the arms, which he did becauseÂ he perceived Lopez as a danger to them and himself. But Lopez fought them and they all fell to the floor, the report said. Stock didnât initially realize he was stabbed, but saw Lopez âholding a knifeâ and wrestling with Gallagher. He then fired four shots. Lopez was pronounced dead at 5:17 p.m., the report said. Â Lopezâs mental health âregressedâ during the COVIDÂ lockdown and he was âunable to stay compliant with his medication, therapy and doctor appointments in the months before his death,â the report said. Lopezâs case managerÂ told police in a sworn statement that she called the police and a hotline operated by the local nonprofit Family Service League several times for wellness checks before his death. âBecause of his behavior, I tried to get him more structured supervision because I feared he might hurt someone when he was having an episode,â the social worker said, according to the report.Â The report said a review of the officers medical records showed Stock, who was admitted to Stony Brook Hospital on the day of Lopezâs death and was discharged on Jan. 6,Â had âmultiple stab wounds, including jugular vein and femoral artery wounds requiring surgery, and was on a ventilator for more than four days.â Gallagherâs medical records said he had âpenetrating stab wounds to the left upper chest and left upper arm, and lacerations to the left hand.""Â Â Dr. James Vosswinkle, head of trauma at Stony Brook University Hospital, said at the time that the officer who was on the ventilator, who the report confirms is Shock, suffered âlife threatening injuries.â Vosswinkle also said then that the other officer, Gallagher, was stabbed through his bulletproof vest, close to his heart, and the knife hit a rib. OSI said it had also reviewed the personnel files Stock, Gallagher, and Livorio, âwhich showed no firearm discharges or firearm investigations before this incident.â Since April 2021, the attorney generalâs Office of Special Investigations has been required by lawÂ to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute any criminal offense that a police officer may have committed in connection with any incident in which the officer caused someoneâs death.Â"

The recordings released by Martinez police show at least two of their officers – Cole Bennett and Raul Ceja-Mendez – firing handguns at an Infiniti sedan as it drives away from Velvet Cannabis Dispensary at 4808 Sunrise Drive in the early morning hours of Aug. 18. Police said a caller had notified them about a video alarm being tripped.  Tahmon Wilson, 20, of San Francisco, was killed in the shooting; his 22-year-old brother, Tommy Wilson Jr., was critically injured but is recovering.  “The family’s reaction is that they feel angry and upset at the way the cops went about their business,” family attorney Adante Pointer said by phone Friday afternoon. “When you see how the officers contact (the two men) in the car and how they are not posing a threat, it’s upsetting to see.  “At the same time, it also gave the family some measure of closure, because up until now, they had no information. Now you have the videotapes out there. They can see for themselves. And now that they see it, they’re outraged.”  The recordings released Thursday were not the full-length versions. In a statement, Martinez Police Chief Andrew White said the shorter-length versions were released because of ongoing criminal and administrative investigations into the shooting and the events that led up to it.  Footage from Bennett’s camera shows him parking behind another patrol vehicle in the driveway to the dispensary and approaching the Infiniti from the driver’s side with his pistol in his hand. As the Infiniti squeezes past the patrol vehicles and appears to bump another officer, Bennett fires at the back of the car and keeps firing as it turns onto the street.  Ceja-Mendez is seen parking behind Bennett’s patrol vehicle and approaching the Infiniti from the front with his gun drawn. The Infiniti then drives toward Mendez and another officer, both of whom jump out of the way. Mendez appears to fire at the driver’s side of the car as it passes him and keeps firing as it drives off.  Police did not specify any injuries to officers after the incident.  GRAPHIC CONTENT: VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED  “The officers put themselves in a bad situation,” Pointer said. “And they shot their way out of it.”  Experts on police force who saw the videotape also questioned aspects of the officers’ actions.  “One of the officers regressed from the car when it started to move,” said Timothy Williams Jr., a retired Los Angeles Police Department detective supervisor who has spent 29 years in law enforcement and is considered an expert on use of force. “There does not seem to be an imminent threat.  “You can pursue (suspects), you can set up an aerial unit overhead, create a perimeter and let other units know they’re coming. There seem to be a lot of other ways this could’ve been handled.”  The Infiniti crashed seconds after the shooting, striking a fire hydrant and coming to a stop about 70 feet from the parking entrance.  The videos are silent for the first 30 seconds — the type of camera used must be activated by a button; once the button is pressed, the previous 30 seconds of video are preserved, and audio recording begins immediately.  “The other question that comes to mind is how many shots were fired,” Williams said. “You can see a whole lot but you don’t hear all of them.”  Use-of-force experts also pointed to new laws in California that have investigators look at not only the use of force by the officer but also the decisions made by the officer that may have put that officer in position to make deadly force necessary.  Williams questioned why officers — on a call for a possible burglary — would approach a car with tinted windows when it didn’t appear to be a threat.  In addition to Bennett and Ceja-Mendez’s body-worn camera footage, White released footage from a third officer, Marc Kahue, as well as security camera footage from the dispensary and recordings of police radio traffic and calls to 911 dispatchers. The footage from Kahue’s camera mostly shows the aftermath of the crash into the fire hydrant.  The body-worn camera of a fourth officer involved in the shooting, Alexander Tirona, was not activated until roughly five minutes after shots were fired, White said. That footage was not released Thursday.  Officers were initially called to the dispensary around 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 18 for reports of an attempted burglary, according to White. Security camera footage showed a group of people outside the business, along with the Infiniti and a Honda C-HR.  The Infiniti was reported stolen in Livermore on Aug. 12. A loaded Glock 10mm handgun was found in the front passenger area, White said, adding that the firearm was purchased in Arizona on Jan. 20 and used in a shooting in Oakland on April 27.  The Honda was also reported stolen and recovered in Oakland after leaving the dispensary, according to White. A third stolen vehicle was abandoned on Sunrise Drive.  The California Department of Justice is investigating the shooting, in accordance with Assembly Bill 1506, which requires the state to probe all police shootings of unarmed civilians. An administrative probe is also underway to determine whether the officers’ actions complied with department policies and procedures. An outside firm is leading the effort.  The department is conducting a third investigation into collateral crimes, including those that may have been committed by individuals that resulted in the initial call for service.  “These investigations will take time,” White said, “but it is critical they are able to accomplish their respective tasks carefully, comprehensively, and independently, based on facts and the evidence.”  Pointer has said from the immediate aftermath of the Aug. 18 shooting that officers had “no reasonable or lawful explanation” for firing their guns, because both men were in a car that was leaving the scene and did not pose a threat. Tahmon was shot once in the back of the head and Tommy was shot twice in the back, according to Pointer."

Santos was alleged to have been seen walking with a handgun near the school. When officers responded, the school was put on lockdown status and officers ordered Santos to drop the gun. Santos instead pointed it at one of the officer, and one fired their service weapon, hitting Santos. According to a department press release, no officers were injured and medical aid was rendered at the scene. Officers then discovered the gun was only a BB gun designed to look like a real handgun. The officer has been placed on administrative leave, and their name will be announced at a later time."
"Ruling likely puts pressure on Minneapolis to settle lawsuit by journalists, observers say",9/29/23,2023-10-01T00:52:15Z,en,startribune.com,https://www.startribune.com/ruling-likely-puts-pressure-on-minneapolis-to-settle-lawsuit-by-journalists-observers-say/600308686/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231001005215id_/https://www.startribune.com/ruling-likely-puts-pressure-on-minneapolis-to-settle-lawsuit-by-journalists-observers-say/600308686/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231001005215/https://www.startribune.com/ruling-likely-puts-pressure-on-minneapolis-to-settle-lawsuit-by-journalists-observers-say/600308686/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN0YXJ0cmlidW5lKS9ydWxpbmctbGlrZWx5LXB1dHMtcHJlc3N1cmUtb24tbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdG8tc2V0dGxlLWxhd3N1aXQtYnktam91cm5hbGlzdHMtb2JzZXJ2ZXJzLXNheS82MDAzMDg2ODY~,"A blistering ruling by U.S. District Judge Wilhelmina Wright this week likely puts pressure on Minneapolis to settle a lawsuit by journalists accusing police of violating their constitutional rights, according to observers with knowledge of such cases. No trial date has been set, and there is no hint that settlement talks are in the works. But Wright's sharply worded language suggests that the suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union-Minnesota (ACLU-MN) has been put in a stronger position, several attorneys said. The Minneapolis City Attorney's Office and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office had sought to quash the case with a summary judgment motion, but they were rebuffed by Wright. ""If you lose a motion for summary judgment, it typically raises pressure on parties to reach some settlement,"" said Senior District Judge Kevin Burke, former Hennepin County chief judge. Wright, Burke said, ""is a pretty moderate person. So if you have language [she used], my suggestion is that that record is pretty damning for the city."" Attorney Jordan Kushner, who has frequently brought lawsuits by protesters, said it's been the pattern of the city to settle such cases ""once it's clear that they are going to be liable."" Kevin Riach, one of the attorneys representing the journalists, said they had not yet heard from the city, and the City Attorney's Office declined to comment. ""We are always happy to entertain discussions with the city about resolving this matter, but if it doesn't resolve we look forward to proving our case in trial,"" Riach said. Former City Council Member Cam Gordon said he believed Wright's ruling puts pressure on the city to settle. ""In my experience, the city has preference for settling rather than exposing themselves and the public to the truth,"" he said. In her ruling Tuesday, Wright wrote that the record ""provides substantial evidence that [Minneapolis Police Department] officers deliberately and systematically targeted journalists, including plaintiffs, who were identifiable as members of the press and not committing any crimes."" She added: ""Plaintiffs have provided evidence of continuing widespread, persistent pattern of unconstitutional misconduct by MPD, deliberate indifference by city defendants, and evidence of a causal link between MPD's custom and plaintiff's injuries."" The ACLU-MN also is suing the Sheriff's Office for the alleged mistreatment of journalists and violation of their rights during protests in 2021 in Brooklyn Center after the police shooting death of Daunte Wright, when then-Sheriff Dave Hutchinson was in charge. The Sheriff's Office, which declined comment Friday, has claimed ""qualified immunity"" shielding a government official who does not violate an individual's statutory or constitutional rights. Wright granted summary judgment on one such claim but denied it on another. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office filed a notice Thursday on behalf of the Sheriff's Office with the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that it intends to appeal the denial of qualified immunity. Jeff Storms, an attorney who has represented clients suing the city, said an opinion like Wright's ""always puts pressure on a city to resolve the matter."" Robert Bennett, who has also frequently sued the city, said Wright's ruling was consistent with investigative findings of Minneapolis police by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Minnesota Human Rights Department. The ACLU-MN sued the State Patrol in the same case, but it settled in 2022 after the patrol agreed to an enhanced process for reviewing the complaints of journalists and an injunction preventing the patrol from assaulting or detaining journalists."
"God establishes equity, not Democrats",9/29/23,2023-10-01T02:31:51Z,en,washingtontimes.com,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/sep/29/god-establishes-equity-not-democrats/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,https://web.archive.org/web/20231001023151id_/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/sep/29/god-establishes-equity-not-democrats/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,https://web.archive.org/web/20231001023151/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/sep/29/god-establishes-equity-not-democrats/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHdhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcykvbmV3cy8yMDIzL3NlcC8yOS9nb2QtZXN0YWJsaXNoZXMtZXF1aXR5LW5vdC1kZW1vY3JhdHM_dXRtX21lZGl1bT1yc3MmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1yc3NfZmVlZA~~,"OPINION:  Leftists love to talk about the need for equity in America, equity in business; they love to talk up the need for diversity, equity and inclusion standards to be created by government and pushed into the hallowed halls of America’s economic structures and education facilities and cultural institutions; they love to demand DEI become the singular guiding compass for all future operations. They see it as an altruistic calling; they see it as a morally righteous imperative; they see it as their religious duty.  But equity is actually the domain of God.  And that makes DEI, as defined by today’s Democrats, as prescribed by today’s Democrats, an open rebellion against God.  “Mighty King, lover of justice, though hast established equity,” Psalm 99 reads, according to the Revised Standard Version. King James says the same: “[T]hou dost establish equity.”  Psalm 9 states similarly: “But the Lord … judges the peoples with equity.”  God’s got this.  Not Democrats.  So when leftists with designs to grow government and remove God from all-things-public in America replace the word equality with the word equity and insist that political leaders take on the role of creating standards of equity, it’s a red flag. It’s a red flag because it’s not coming from a place of biblical equity, but rather earthly, politicized equity.  As social justice warrior DeRay Mckesson put it, in the wake of the St. Louis police shooting death of Michael Brown — and the ensuing lies of the “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” movement that developed: “The difference between equity and equality is that equality is everyone get[s] the same thing and equity is everyone get[s] the things they deserve,” TechCrunch reported, in 2017.  That’s a perilous line for America to walk.  Whereas the Constitution, court cases, capitalism and the concept of American Exceptionalism all guarantee the right of the individual to pursue success and happiness regardless of race, sex, income level — while still allowing that not all want the same things; not all possess the same talents and skills; not all will in the end reap identical rewards — equity is a different beast.  Equity says that no matter where all start, all must finish the same.  Moreover, equity dangerously sets somebody in charge of ensuring that all finish the same.  In a scenario where Joe Citizen works hard, studies harder, scrimps and saves the hardest of all, and as such, manages to move from poverty to riches, and Jack Citizen drops out of school, sells drugs, goes to jail, and fails to learn any valuable skills that yield career advancement — equality holds Jack accountable for poor life choices. Equity cries that Jack had a hard life and that Joe should therefore pay to support Jack — and that government, and only government, can manage the task of properly redistributing resources.  No wonder Democrats love a good DEI sob story.  They can exploit the heck out of it for political purposes.  After all, it’s easy to turn Jack into a victim. It’s easy for Democrats to demand more tax dollars for Jack; to call out the social injustices of society and advocate for more government services; to rail against a criminal system that unfairly imprisons some, but lets others go free — and then to cite wildly out-of-context statistics about skin colors and police brutality and so forth and so on; statistics which serve only to incite the masses and fuel angst and division that can be further exploited for political use.  Democrats, with equity, find easy causes to pretend to support; to turn into talking points to attack Republicans.  Equality is a lot harder in that regard.  Equality says we are all equal in God’s eyes; that we are all endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are the rights to pursue life, liberty and happiness — but that the outcomes of those pursuits depends largely on the individual.  Equality means government needs to get out of the way of God working through the individual to bring about His glory — glory which very often includes elevating those with the least to positions that are the highest.  Equity means God needs to get out of government’s way, so that the bureaucratic class can have a good look at who’s got what, who should get what, and who should give up what to provide for the government’s selected class.  Equality is freeing. Equity is binding.  Equality is American. Equity is communist.  Equality is godly. Equity is wicked; it promotes a lie and promises an outcome that can never be realized.  And it’s not just a political endeavor, or a Democrat talking point, or a leftist trend, or a social justice warrior tactic that has suddenly, and seemingly from nowhere, sprung into America’s businesses and economic models, and places of education.  It’s a secular push toward collectivism with roots in spiritual warfare and led by the very enemies to God.  The Bible makes that clear.  • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at cchumley@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter, @ckchumley. Listen to her podcast “Bold and Blunt” by clicking HERE.

Kathleen Boleyn filed the lawsuit in June 2022, a year after the midday shootings in the main square of Olde Town Arvada, about 7 miles northwest of downtown Denver. Boleyn said her son, Johnny Hurley, ran toward danger and fatally shot the gunman, Ronald Troyke, who had just fatally shot officer Gordon Beesley. An investigation found Troyke was intent on killing as many officers as he could. The lawsuit said Hurley was crouched down with a rifle pointing down and not in a threatening position when he was shot, adding that a witness said Hurley was taking the magazine out of a rifle that he took away from the shooter. A district attorney investigation cleared the officer who shot him, Kraig Brownlow. The investigation said it appeared to the officer that Hurley was reloading the rifle or trying to fix something on it, and that Brownlow thought Hurley was a second shooter. Tribal court backs slaves' descendants OKLAHOMA CITY -- A judge for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma ruled in favor of citizenship for two descendants of Black slaves once owned by tribal members, potentially paving the way for hundreds of other descendants known as freedmen. District Judge Denette Mouser, based in the tribe's headquarters in Okmulgee, ruled late Wednesday in favor of two Black Muscogee Nation freedmen, Rhonda Grayson and Jeff Kennedy, who had sued the tribe's citizenship board for denying their applications. Mouser reversed the board's decision and ordered it to reconsider the applications in accordance with the tribe's Treaty of 1866, which provides that descendants of those listed on the Creek Freedmen Roll are eligible for tribal citizenship. Freedman citizenship has been a difficult issue for tribes as the U.S. reckons with its history of racism. The Cherokee Nation has granted full citizenship to its freedmen, while other tribes, like the Muscogee Nation, have argued that sovereignty allows tribes to make their own decisions about who qualifies for citizenship. Muscogee Nation Attorney General Geri Wisner said in a statement that the tribe plans to immediately appeal the ruling to the Muscogee Nation's Supreme Court. Mouser pointed out in her decision that slavery within the tribe did not always look like slavery in the South and that slaves were often adopted into the owner's clan, where they participated in cultural ceremonies and spoke the tribal language. ""The families later known as Creek Freedmen likewise walked the Trail of Tears alongside the tribal clans and fought to protect the new homeland upon arrival in Indian Territory,"" Mouser wrote. Florida gunman said upset by car service LARGO, Fla. -- A shooting at a Florida auto shop that killed two men was triggered by a former customer's dissatisfaction with work done on his car two years ago, police said Thursday. The Largo Police Department said Eugene Frank Becker, 78, arrived at Stout's Automotive in a rental car Wednesday and sought out business owner Jodie Stout, 52. Investigators say Becker pulled out a handgun and shot Stout, who returned fire with his own gun, striking Becker multiple times. Both men later died at a hospital. Police said in an email that evidence and witnesses indicate Becker felt he was overcharged when he brought a vehicle to Stout's for service in 2021. Authorities said family members told them Becker had recently been in a car crash that left him depressed. Invasive lanternflies found in Illinois SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Illinois is the latest state to find invasive spotted lanternflies, a winged insect that's spreading across the eastern U.S. and is subject to squish-on-sight requests in New York and elsewhere. First detected in the U.S. nearly a decade ago, the hitchhiking pest and its eggs have been getting rides on vehicles and trains as they expand from southeast Pennsylvania across the country. Although the inch-long plant-hopper looks pretty with its distinctive black spots and bright red wing markings, the sap-sucking bug likes to mass and feed on plants. It then excretes a sticky, sugary waste called honeydew that attracts insects and a form of sooty mold that can finish off the already weakened plants, posing a danger to crops and native trees. The gunk can also collect on houses, decks and outdoor furniture. The Illinois Department of Agriculture said a sighting of one of the winged adult insects was reported on Sept. 16 at an undisclosed location. After collecting specimens, officials confirmed Tuesday they are the first spotted lanternflies identified in the state. Native to eastern Asia, they've previously been confirmed in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, as well as parts of the southeastern U.S."

Blackwell spoke to the local outlet on the porch of her home while wearing a T-shirt and hat both saying: “Aint nuffin.”  If that was a nod to her legal woes, however, her family clearly seemed to disagree — with her mom pulling up outside and holding down her horn to stop the interview.  The influencer’s grandmother then minced no words when discussing her antics.  4 Dayjia Blackwell, the shameless influencer known as “Meatball,” expressed her regret for her role in this week’s Philadelphia riots. Philadelphia police department  4 Her grandmother, Vashti Fields, said she was “ashamed” of her antics. WTXF-TV  “What goes through my mind, as a grandmother, is I’m very ashamed. I’m very ashamed to see my [grandchild] there, at that time,” Vashti Fields told Fox 29.  “When I see someone of my blood, that has been there while this is happening … that hurts me deeply.”  But she also described her granddaughter as a “loving, kind, caring, business-minded go-getter,” adding: “I want her to start a business and, most of all, I want her to be a positive influencer.”  4 Blackwell, 21, who spent “hours” in a holding cell after being arrested, said she was “traumatized” by the experience and wants to “cry” every time she thinks about it. Instagram / @dayjiamainpage  “Meatball” was charged with causing/risking a catastrophe, criminal mischief, riot, aiding consummation, access to communication and disorderly conduct.  Fields said she doesn’t think her granddaughter is guilty of all that, but wants her to publicly apologize by writing a letter to the City of Brotherly Love and, hopefully, use her voice for good.  “Meatball” also took to Instagram to give her side of the story and plug her Cash App handle for her fans to send her money as a “welcome home” gift.  4 Police used the social media posts of Blackwell and other alleged looters to determine their precise location amid the chaos, Instagram / @dayjiamainpage  “All I want to do is go treat myself,” she told her fans on Instagram, saying she wants to go get her “toes done,” as well as address her legal woes.  The influencer said she wants the charges “expunged” from her record and insisted that she is “not a trouble person.”  “I’m a good person. I’m a businesswoman. I don’t like it. I didn’t know this s–t would go this far,” she said.  “I’ve never been through nothing like that in my life. I don’t even know what happened, like I need some sleep. I’m scared, I’m traumatized. Never again in my life, like seriously,” “Meatball” said on a video posted to her Instagram Story.  Authorities have said the looting was unrelated to earlier protests in Philadelphia over a judge dismissing charges in the police shooting of Eddie Irizarry, 27."

In a statement, the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office identified the man as Lamar Walker, 24, of Vacaville. Just before 11:15 a.m. on Sept. 21, Albany and Berkeley police officers were dispatched to the Toyota of Berkeley Service Center at 1025 Eastshore Highway, near the Berkeley border, for a report of an active shooter, the sheriff’s office said. Berkeley officers arrived at the scene first and evacuated the area. They then entered an open door on the west side of the service center and started searching for the suspect and victims in need of medical assistance, according to the sheriff’s office. When officers reached the second floor, they found Walker crouched near a desk in a large open office area. The sheriff’s office said Walker was pointing a silver revolver at the entryway. Five officers fired their weapons at Walker to “prevent further injuries or loss of life,” according to the sheriff’s office. Walker was hit by multiple rounds and died at the scene. Officers discovered Alonna Gallon, 24, of Richmond, dead on the floor near Walker. Gallon, who worked at the service center, had been shot at least once in the head. Gallon and Walker were the parents of a 7-year-old son, King Walker. Earlier this week, Gallon’s mother, Yuvonda Gallon, started an online fundraiser for King. As of late Thursday, the GoFundMe page had raised nearly $42,000 of its $50,000 goal. “This was not a random crime,” the sheriff’s office said. “Alonna Gallon’s death was a senseless act of violence. She leaves behind a 7-year-old son, whom she co-parented with the suspect. Our hearts go out to Ms. Gallon’s son and her family.” An investigation revealed Walker may have attempted suicide before officers arrived, according to the sheriff’s office.

Antonio Lacunas Escobar, 37, of Hayward, died Sept. 6 at a hospital after being rushed there following the confrontation about 10 p.m. in the 2200 block of City Center Drive. Police later found a BB gun at the scene following eyewitness accounts that the man appeared to pull a gun on the officers.  Authorities earlier this week said Officers Alexander Robinson and Dominic Espino fired their guns during the incident. A third officer who didn’t fire his gun also was part of the police response.  Robinson and Espino each have about five years of experience with the department, according to acting Police Chief Bryan Matthews. Both have returned to work following a period of paid administrative leave, according to the department.  Police spokesperson Cassondra Fovel said the time it took to identify the man publicly came because of the time it took to complete his autopsy and to find his relatives. She also said investigative concerns were part of the equation.  Police have not yet released video footage from body cameras worn by Robinson and Espino.  According to Matthews, police encountered a man who had left the area after reportedly pulling a gun at at least one person. The man then acted confrontationally and walked away from police, he said. He added that at least one witness told them that the man then pulled a gun.  The fatal police shooting was the second involving the department in the past 11 months. Officers shot to death 20-year-old Xavier Benson, of Oakland, on Oct. 24, 2022 after a pursuit from an apartment complex into an unincorporated Alameda County roadway.  The Alameda County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the more recent shooting along with an outside agency that will determined whether the officers acted within department policy."

Los Angeles County prosecutors accused Officers Dedier Reyes and David Salcedo of lying about the circumstances in which they recovered a handgun, causing the wrong person to be arrested and briefly jailed, authorities had said. Both men were charged with falsifying a public record, while Reyes faced an additional count of perjury and Salcedo was charged with a separate count of filing a false report.  After a six-day trial and more than five hours of deliberation, a downtown L.A. jury acquitted both officers of all charges.  Advertisement  “Today’s verdict in the acquittal of two Long Beach police officers is a reminder of the challenges we face in the pursuit of justice. While we respect the judicial process and the decision rendered, we cannot deny our disappointment in the outcome,” Dist. Atty. George Gascón said in a statement.  The officers’ arrests initially led both Long Beach city and L.A. County prosecutors to open reviews into cases where they either served as witnesses or were the arresting officer. In 2021, Long Beach City Prosecutor Douglas Haubert told the Long Beach Post he was reviewing more than 800 closed and pending cases involving Reyes and Salcedo.  Haubert did not respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. Gascón said the acquittal “does not absolve us of the responsibility to consider the underlying conduct of the officers” when reviewing other cases. It was not immediately clear how many past or pending cases involving Reyes and Salcedo the office was reviewing.  Both officers were fired by the Long Beach Police Department in April 2022, according to Richard Mejia, a public information officer for the agency. He did not offer a specific reason for their termination.  The charges already led to at least one person’s release. Last year, a judge granted the district attorney’s office’s request to re-sentence 34-year-old Miguel Vargas. Vargas had previously been convicted of assault on Reyes during an incident where the officer shot Vargas in the back.  Advertisement  In that case, Vargas was convicted of assault and gun possession, despite the fact that the gun was never fired and Reyes never accused Vargas of pointing a weapon at him.  Vargas’ attorney, Matthew Kaestner, previously told The Times his client was leaving a party that police had responded to when he was chased by Reyes and Salcedo.  Vargas fled because he had a gun — which he was barred from possessing due to a prior felony conviction — but threw it away during the foot chase, Kaestner said. Reyes had alleged Vargas was turning toward him and reaching for a firearm, but Kaestner said the handgun was found “25 feet away” from where Vargas fell after being shot.  While he was initially sentenced to nearly four decades in prison because of sentencing enhancements, prosecutors filed a petition to re-sentence him to time served in 2022 following Reyes’ arrest. Citing issues with Reyes’ credibility, the district attorney’s office asked a judge to vacate the assault conviction against Vargas and grant him release after 12 years in prison on the gun possession charge."

He sued the city to help cover his medical expenses.  Dexter White’s chest still tightens when he sees the photo on Instagram of his crumpled body, moments after a group of Los Angeles police officers shot him after mistaking his cellphone for a gun.  He had pulled out the phone in confusion as officers surrounded him as he walked to the corner store, responding to what turned out to be a false report of domestic violence one afternoon more than five years ago.  One of the officers thought White might have a gun, prompting him and several colleagues to start shooting. Bullets ripped into his legs and shoulder as he fell to the pavement — but he survived.  Advertisement  His shooting, around the corner from his South L.A. apartment building, was one of at least 38 in the last five years in which LAPD officers opened fire on someone who ended up being unarmed, according to a Times review of nearly 200 police shootings since 2018.  Dexter White shows off a scar from getting shot by LAPD officers in 2018. White was on his way to the corner store when he was confronted by LAPD officers and critically wounded. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)  The near-death experience left White traumatized and prone to bouts of fear, anxiety and anger.  “I’ve broken down multiple times,” White said. He no longer drives by himself, out of fear of being pulled over while alone, he said.  Since the shooting, he has been stopped several times while riding in the car with his aunt Alexis Banks, each time explaining to officers what happened to him so they don’t misinterpret his jitters.  In some LAPD shootings since 2018, the person hit was carrying a plastic replica pistol or butane lighter that resembled a firearm, cases that fit the state attorney general’s definition of unarmed. In several other cases, officers shot at someone after they discarded their weapon.  At times, officers have hit innocent bystanders, drawing criticism from some city leaders, activists and residents that officers are still too quick to use lethal force without considering options to resolve a situation. Two years ago, an LAPD officer killed 14-year-old Valentina Orellana Peralta when he shot at an assault suspect in a North Hollywood store. Like other shooting survivors and relatives of those killed by LAPD officers, the teen’s family sued the city, alleging that the officer who fired the fatal bullet violated her rights. The case is pending.  Advertisement  White filed his own lawsuit challenging the actions that led to him being shot in 2018.  The first officer to shoot opened fire so quickly after arriving on the scene that he couldn’t even put his police cruiser in park, White’s lawsuit said. His gunfire prompted other officers to start shooting in the belief they were under fire, which the lawsuit described as a clear case of so-called contagious fire.  Last month, a federal jury ruled in White’s favor, finding that LAPD Officer Rodolfo Sarmiento had violated his constitutional rights in the January 2018 shooting while he was unarmed. White was awarded $2.35 million in damages.  In his closing arguments, George Mgdesyan, White’s attorney, said that his client was not being aggressive and made no moves toward the officers that could be mistaken for an attack. If anything, Mgdesyan said, White was fearful, as many Black men would be upon encountering a group of officers with their guns drawn, he said.  Mgdesyan argued that while some officers at the scene tried to de-escalate the situation, Sarmiento seemed primed for a confrontation, driving there with his gun drawn and jumping out of a still-rolling squad car “like it’s the wild, wild West.”  Among other missteps, Mgdesyan said, several officers involved failed to activate their body-worn cameras. And none of them recalled White taking a shooting stance or seeing the barrel of a gun while being interviewed shortly after the shooting; they mentioned those details only months later at their depositions, the attorney said.  A 911 caller had mistakenly reported that White might be armed with a knife, but Mgdesyan said that did not warrant lethal force. “If the police mentality is that anytime I pull somebody over it can escalate to a shooting, then that would justify shooting every time,” he said.  Geoffrey Plowden, an attorney for the officers, said they believed they might be facing an armed suspect who had just stabbed a woman. “We’re not talking about … jaywalking,” he said.  Plowden said the encounter might have ended differently if White had obeyed police commands. Instead, he said, White forced officers to react quickly when he crossed his arms, a move that suggested defiance, not confusion, and began digging into his pockets.  As the defense played video of the encounter, several of White’s supporters walked out, sobbing. Others turned away from the large TV screen. White bowed his head as the sound of the officers’ gunfire filled the courtroom, his face scrunched in a grimace.  “We’re not here because the officers shot him, it’s because he forced the officers to shoot him because he didn’t obey their commands,” Plowden said.  Dexter White displays a picture that shows him after LAPD officers shot him in 2018. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)  White said he walked to the store to buy cigarettes and clear his head after getting into a heated argument with the teenage daughter of a woman he was romantically involved with. He wasn’t aware at the time, but the daughter had gone next door and called 911 to say someone had been stabbed — a fib that she later retracted, White said.  He heard the helicopter buzzing overhead, but didn’t realize it was there for him. When the first two officers showed up, they screamed at him to drop his weapon and to get on the ground. He froze. “I stopped and I was confused because I didn’t know what was going on,” White said, saying other arriving officers made no efforts to de-escalate the situation. “Soon as I turned my back, I heard gunshots and hit the ground.”  The jury cleared the other two officers who fired their weapons, Davin Aquino and James Quinata.  An after-action report by the inspector general’s office was critical of certain aspects of the officers’ tactics, singling out Sarmiento for drawing his weapon while driving to the scene and jumping out of a still-moving vehicle, which placed him “at a tactical disadvantage.”  The report concluded that the officers’ 19 shots were justified given the “totality of the circumstances,” contending that Sarmiento and others reasonably reacted so quickly based on the belief that White was pointing a gun in their direction.  While the department doesn’t offer any specific training on identifying whether a person is carrying a gun, officers are generally taught to focus on a person’s hands during an encounter, keying in on visual cues like someone reaching for their waistband, according to LAPD Sgt. Tom Willers, assistant officer in charge of the department’s tactics unit.  Willers said officers are trained to consider de-escalation first, using space and cover to slow down encounters. At the same time, he said, they are taught to always be vigilant since seemingly innocuous items can be weapons: “We’re talking about cane guns, we’re talking about wallet guns, we’re talking about guns that are created to look like cellphones.”  Such training occurs first at the Police Academy and every year officers are on the job, he said.  Despite public perception, he said, police shootings are statistically rare. Of 2,300 uses of force by LAPD in 2018, only 26 involved firearms, and the instances when officers shot an unarmed person are even more infrequent.  Officers are also put through the department’s next-gen virtual reality simulator, which Willers said drops them into scenarios meant to replicate the fast-moving nature of police work to see how they will react, all while tracking their heart rate and eye movements. Afterward, officers are debriefed, with trainers pointing out areas of improvement.  After prevailing in his trial, White said the money he was awarded will help with a mountain of medical bills: $150,000 for reconstructive surgery on his clavicle, $25,000 to fix his clawed hands; and $50,000 to replace his hip, where a bullet remains lodged. Doctors have said he may always walk with a limp. Perhaps his biggest lament is that he can’t teach his son how to shoot hoops because his hand won’t open wide enough to dribble a basketball.  He scoffed at the allegation — raised by officers at the trial — that he was trying to commit “suicide-by-cop.” Why would he do that, White asked, when he was days away from signing a deal with a record label. The deal fell apart as he lay in the hospital for months, recovering.  He said he struggles to put on a strong face in front of his kids, ages 5 through 15, who have “very vivid” memories of almost losing their father.  “They don’t want him to leave home because they don’t want anything to happen to him,” his aunt said. “They’re traumatized.”  On a recent afternoon, White’s eyes welled with tears as he ticked off his lingering injuries. The last few years have been hell, he said. Nerve damage left him with such limited range in his hands that he can’t make a closed fist.  Dexter White has limited use of his left hand after getting shot by LAPD officers in 2018. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)  White declined to stay on prescribed painkillers, because he didn’t want to get addicted. Instead, he toughs out everyday tasks. “Even putting on socks is hard,” he said.  He still suffers from regular panic attacks, including once during church when he didn’t realize his pastor had invited several officers to speak to the congregation.  “My whole body just freezes up and starts trembling and stuff,” he said. He felt an attack coming on after someone sent a photo of him that was circulating on Instagram. A student at the high school across the street took the photo of White as he lay motionless on the sidewalk after being shot. The caption read: “Cops shot this [Black man] in back of manual [Arts High School]!!!” and “dead af couldve been me,” with two crying face emojis.  “It kind of shocked me, because I looked dead and it really set me back a little bit,” he said. “It kind of scared me a little bit that I even experienced that, and it all came back to me at once.”"

With President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's term ending next year, family members face not only the prospect of a ninth year of not knowing what happened to their sons but fears that the next administration will start the error-plagued investigation over from scratch yet again. In 2014, a group of students were attacked by municipal police in the southern city of Iguala, Guerrero, who handed them over to a local drug gang that apparently killed them and burned their bodies. Since the Sept. 26 attack, only three of their remains have been identified. After an initial coverup, last year a government truth commission concluded that local, state and federal authorities colluded with the gang to murder the students in what it called a ''state crime.'' Ulises Gutierrez Solano joined the march in honor of his brother, Aldo, a student who survived the initial kidnapping but was left in a ''vegetative state'' since 2014 after police shot him in the head while the others students were being abducted. ''This is an atrocity to humanity, to society,'' said Solano. ''How could they do so much harm to so many people?'' LÃ³pez Obrador had pledged to solve the case and recent years have seen a painstakingly slow release of documents from the abduction, as well as a slew of arrests. But activists and human rights organizations say the government has not done enough to atone for the murders, investigate exactly what happened, and punish the culprits. Tensions rose just hours before the march, when the families and their lawyers rejected a series of documents the Mexican government offered to make public, claiming the specific military files they requested months ago were not included. The army said it didn't have those files. ''Since August the families have been asking, but they just gave us part of the information'' said Nicholas MendÃ©z, leading a group of students from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. ''That's worrying because we're changing government next year.'' LÃ³pez Obrador's six-year term ends in September 2024 and, MendÃ©z feared, petitioning a new president for information could mean starting from scratch. ''We can't have another six years of nothing,'' MendÃ©z said. In a press conference Tuesday morning, Mexico's president insisted all of the relevant documents had been released. ''We have principles; we have ideals, and we speak the truth,'' LÃ³pez Obrador said, promising also to publish government social media messages about the case. The students from a radical teachers' college had travelled to Iguala to hijack buses to get to a protest in Mexico City, but were intercepted by corrupt police linked to the Guerreros Unidos gang. Iguala officials thought the students were going to disrupt a local political event, and one of the hijacked buses may have carried a drug shipment. Recent years have seen a run of government and army officials from the time arrested, but no more remains have been found. Then-Attorney General, JesÃºs Murillo Karam, and the head of his anti-kidnapping unit have been arrested for their initial, botched investigation following the abductions. Almost a dozen military personnel, including the commander of the area where the students were abducted, have also been arrested. After evidence used to assemble an expert report in August was undermined, the case's chief prosecutor, Omar GÃ³mez Trejo, resigned. Just this year a party from the Inter-American Human Rights Commission which has been investigating the incident since 2015 also withdrew from Mexico. As families marched through the city, they passed barricades erected to protect monuments. The march was peaceful, notwithstanding isolated incidents of violence when demonstrators attacked and damaged some stores, according to local media. At one traffic circle, activists had plastered posters in remembrance not just of the 43 students, but of all Mexico's missing. The Ayotzinapa atrocity has taken on symbolic significance for a country with more than 110,000 missing people. Pablo Hector Gonzalez has traveled from Guerrero every year to join the march. ''After nine years, in force, we will insist until the truth appears and until all the guilty are punished,'' he said."

Sgt. Christopher Liakopoulos, 44, and Officer Ruben Reynoso, 43, both with the department’s Major Accident Unit, were on their way to conduct a training session shortly before 7 a.m. on July 22 last year when a group of men walking down 18th Street caught their attention and they stopped to investigate.  Moments after reversing their unmarked squad car near Morgan Street, both officers fired their guns through an open passenger window of their car, striking Miguel Medina twice.  The officers then exchanged gunfire with a juvenile in the group who had started to run away during the initial stop.  Both officers claimed they had been fired on first.  Surveillance video of the shooting contradicted the officers’ statements and State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced two months later that her office would charge both officers with aggravated battery, aggravated assault and official misconduct.  In closing arguments Wednesday before Judge Lawrence Flood, defense attorney James McKay said the charges were the result of “a political agenda that flies in the face of law enforcement.”  He said he was sorry for the two young prosecutors “tasked to walk this dog of a case” that he said never should have made it into a criminal courtroom.  McKay and co-counsel Tim Grace repeatedly referred to Medina as a “gangbanger” and “a liar,” and the juvenile in the group as a “cockroach.”  Both were on a “two-day bender” of partying with alcohol and marijuana, and had been flashing a gun on social media immediately before the shooting, the defense said.  Grace said video of Medina and the juvenile standing near the officers’ car showed they were about to commit “a coordinated ambush of the officers, a surprise attack,” even though the juvenile appeared to turn and run away before the first shots were fired by the officers.  The video also showed Medina raising one hand in the air to wave at the officers while holding a bottle of wine and a cellphone.  McKay asked the judge to overlook the fact that both officers claimed they were fired upon first in their official reports.  “What do you think these men are feeling when these stupid reports are filled out?” McKay yelled theatrically in the courtroom, calling the reports “garbage.”  But none of that matters, both defense attorneys contended, stressing the law allowed the officers to use deadly force if they reasonably felt threatened, without being judged with the benefit of hindsight.  “They do not have to wait until they are fired upon,” Grace said.  But prosecutors noted that neither officer had seen social media videos showing the gun or the partying. “You don’t get to go back and justify an unjustified shooting by saying at least police shot a bad guy,” Assistant State’s Attorney Tom Fryska argued.  If the officers were so concerned that Medina was an armed threat, the prosecutors asked, why didn’t the surveillance video show either of them approaching Medina afterward to search for the weapon.  They knew “he didn’t have one,” Fryska said.  Medina testified on the first day of the trial last week, but both officers declined to take the stand in their defense.  Prosecutors put on a single witness Wednesday, a man whose apartment on 18th Street overlooked the scene of the shooting and who was enjoying a morning cup of coffee when the gunfire broke out.  The witness said he rendered aid to Medina before paramedics arrived, using skills he had learned at a wilderness medicine class he took through an employer.  On cross-examination, McKay asked the witness if he had told detectives that “you hate what the police stand for.”  “Correct,” the man replied.  The judge would not allow him to answer a follow-up question from prosecutors about his negative encounters with police that led him to that opinion.  The defense called a city employee who was operating a street sweeper on 18th Street when the shooting happened.  The employee said he had seen Medina, who was wearing a white hoodie, holding a gun before the shooting. But he couldn’t recall, when pressed by prosecutors, on why he had given a different description of the person holding the gun to detectives the day after the shooting “when his memory was fresh.”  The judge said he expected to give his ruling after 1 p.m. Thursday."

"Tamika Mallory, Warrior Queen",9/27/23,2023-09-29T01:18:44Z,en,seattlemedium.com,https://seattlemedium.com/tamika-mallory-warrior-queen/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230929011844id_/https://seattlemedium.com/tamika-mallory-warrior-queen/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230929011844/https://seattlemedium.com/tamika-mallory-warrior-queen/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGVtZWRpdW0pL3RhbWlrYS1tYWxsb3J5LXdhcnJpb3ItcXVlZW4~,"by Julianne Malveaux  (Trice Edney Wire) – Some people first saw civil rights activist Tamika Mallory when she was one of four leaders of the 2017 Women’s March. Her activism hardly began there. From her teen years, the now 43-year-old activist was part of Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. In 2013, she became NAN’s youngest executive director. In 2016, she was one of the four co-chairs of the highly successful 2017 Women’s March. In 2019, Tamika, Mysonne Linen, Angelo Pinto, and fellow women’s march co-chair Linda Sarsour founded Until Freedom, a nonprofit organization for “community activism, education, and rapid response around tragedies resulting from injustice.”  Mallory has earned awards and accolades from Time Magazine, Fortune Magazine, BET, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and others. She has also attracted the ire of racists and recently has received death threats that both the police and the FBI consider “credible.” While the threats don’t frighten her, they concern those who support her work. Roland Martin, the pioneering founder of the Black Star Network, featured a segment on the threats she is receiving.  Tamika is being threatened because she does not back down, warrior that she is. She spent time in Kentucky in the wake of the murder of Breona Taylor, working with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, and with the community. She was outraged, as many were, that the African American Attorney General of Kentucky, Daniel Cameron, described Breonna Taylor’s murder as “justifiable”. Now, Daniel Cameron is the Republican nominee to unseat Democratic governor Andy Beshear in a November 7 election. Tamika Mallory and her colleagues in Until Freedom have determined that Cameron will not be the governor.  Until Freedom (untilfreedom.com) launched a voter engagement campaign to register voters and educate them about the harmful impact Daniel Cameron might have on Kentucky. They opened an office in Louisville in September. And Tamika and her team have endured death threats from their opponents. These aren’t the idle death threats of phone calls and hang-ups. These death threats suggest that the Until Freedom team has been stalked and followed. Upon their arrival in Lousiville, several hotels reported getting calls looking for Tamika Mallory and the others. They now have private security and some police protection, and, as A. Scott Bolden, a DC-based Democratic lawyer, noted on Roland Martin Unfiltered, “Tamika is a fearsome fighter. Threats aren’t going to stop her.” Still, the threats must be anxiety-producing, and the FBI must leave no stone unturned in identifying the cowards who oppose both Tamika and justice.  Because of how Cameron presented the case against the Louisville officers who murdered Breonna Taylor, no one was indicted for her death. The officers shot into her home, using a no-knock warrant as their justification. At least two grand jury members say Cameron did not present all of the facts. The Department of Justice has brought charges to a federal grand jury, and four have been indicted. Kelly Ann Goodlett has pled guilty to conspiracy because she knew there was no basis for the invasion into Breonna’s home but conspired with another officer to justify the warrant. She will be sentenced in November and faces up to 5 years in jail and up to $250,000 in fines.  The other three– Joshua Jaynes, Brett Hankison, and Kyle Meany – were arrested and released on bond. They face trials in mid-October. Other officers were not indicted either because they did not know the warrant was faulty or “there wasn’t enough evidence” against them. In bringing indictments against the four officers, however, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke ensured that there would be at least some measure of justice for Breonna Taylor.  Civil Rights attorney Ben Crump represented Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, in a wrongful death settlement against Louisville. He won both a $12 million settlement and police reforms, including the abolishment of the no-knock warrant. That’s partial justice. Real justice will come when the man who described Breonna’s murder as “justifiable.” And if Tamika Mallory has anything to do with it, his callous response to the death of a young Black woman will end his political career (or he can work for his ally, the (twice impeached former president).  Tamika Mallory has become part of the Louisville Black community. She has developed a close relationship with Tamika Palmer and has also become a known presence in the city. She has visited churches, been a presence on the streets, and, through Until Freedom, channeled nearly a million dollars into the community. Her organization has also fed thousands of people and has become a resource for Black people in Louisville.

The graffiti on the barrier reads “Military Narcostate” in Spanish. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)  MEXICO CITY (AP) — Chanting from one to 43, relatives of students abducted nine years ago counted out the number of the missing youths as they marched through Mexico City Tuesday to demand answers to one of Mexico’s most infamous human rights cases.  With President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s term ending next year, family members face not only the prospect of a ninth year of not knowing what happened to their sons but fears that the next administration will start the error-plagued investigation over from scratch yet again.  In 2014, a group of students were attacked by municipal police in the southern city of Iguala, Guerrero, who handed them over to a local drug gang that apparently killed them and burned their bodies. Since the Sept. 26 attack, only three of their remains have been identified.  After an initial coverup, last year a government truth commission concluded that local, state and federal authorities colluded with the gang to murder the students in what it called a “state crime.”  Ulises Gutierrez Solano joined the march in honor of his brother, Aldo, a student who survived the initial kidnapping but was left in a “vegetative state” since 2014 after police shot him in the head while the others students were being abducted.  “This is an atrocity to humanity, to society,” said Solano. “How could they do so much harm to so many people?”  López Obrador had pledged to solve the case and recent years have seen a painstakingly slow release of documents from the abduction, as well as a slew of arrests. But activists and human rights organizations say the government has not done enough to atone for the murders, investigate exactly what happened, and punish the culprits.  Tensions rose just hours before the march, when the families and their lawyers rejected a series of documents the Mexican government offered to make public, claiming the specific military files they requested months ago were not included. The army said it didn’t have those files.  “Since August the families have been asking, but they just gave us part of the information” said Nicholas Mendéz, leading a group of students from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “That’s worrying because we’re changing government next year.”  López Obrador’s six-year term ends in September 2024 and, Mendéz feared, petitioning a new president for information could mean starting from scratch.  “We can’t have another six years of nothing,” Mendéz said.  In a press conference Tuesday morning, Mexico’s president insisted all of the relevant documents had been released.  “We have principles; we have ideals, and we speak the truth,” López Obrador said, promising also to publish government social media messages about the case.  The students from a radical teachers’ college had travelled to Iguala to hijack buses to get to a protest in Mexico City, but were intercepted by corrupt police linked to the Guerreros Unidos gang. Iguala officials thought the students were going to disrupt a local political event, and one of the hijacked buses may have carried a drug shipment.  Recent years have seen a run of government and army officials from the time arrested, but no more remains have been found.  Then-Attorney General, Jesús Murillo Karam, and the head of his anti-kidnapping unit have been arrested for their initial, botched investigation following the abductions. Almost a dozen military personnel, including the commander of the area where the students were abducted, have also been arrested.  After evidence used to assemble an expert report in August was undermined, the case’s chief prosecutor, Omar Gómez Trejo, resigned. Just this year a party from the Inter-American Human Rights Commission which has been investigating the incident since 2015 also withdrew from Mexico.  As families marched through the city, they passed barricades erected to protect monuments. The march was peaceful, notwithstanding isolated incidents of violence when demonstrators attacked and damaged some stores, according to local media.  At one traffic circle, activists had plastered posters in remembrance not just of the 43 students, but of all Mexico’s missing.  The Ayotzinapa atrocity has taken on symbolic significance for a country with more than 110,000 missing people.  Pablo Hector Gonzalez has traveled from Guerrero every year to join the march.  “After nine years, in force, we will insist until the truth appears and until all the guilty are punished,” he said."

(Trent Sprague/Chicago Tribune)  As prosecutors closed their case against two Chicago police officers Wednesday at the Leighton Criminal Court Building, they alleged that the officers shot an unarmed man, instigated a gunfight with the man’s companion and then lied about it on official department forms.  The officers, Christopher Liakopoulos, 44, and Ruben Reynoso, 43, are charged with two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and two counts of official misconduct, all felonies, in connection with a July 2022 on-duty shooting in Pilsen that wounded one person.  Advertisement  They are standing trial before Cook County Judge Lawrence Flood, who told a crowded gallery of observers that he plans to hand down a verdict Thursday afternoon.  “Before they knew they had to get their story straight, they lied,” said Assistant State’s Attorney Alyssa Janicki. “There is no justification here.”  Advertisement  The prosecutors entered into evidence reports that officers must fill out after they have used force in a police encounter. In those, Janicki said, Liakopoulos and Reynoso indicated that they were fired upon first. Surveillance video shows that to be untrue, she said.  Jim McKay, an attorney for Reynoso, though, crumpled up a piece of paper during closing arguments, calling the reports “garbage.”  “(You) check off a box after you’ve been shot at,” he said. “What do you think these men are thinking after these stupid forms are filled out.”  Prosecutors allege that Liakopoulos and Reynoso were unjustified when they shot Miguel Medina, 24, in the 1000 block of West 18th Street around 7 a.m. on July 22, 2022.  The officers, investigators with the major accidents squad, were driving to the police academy to give trainings that morning when Medina and the group he was with caught their eyes, prosecutors said. In an unmarked sedan, the officers passed the group and then slowly reversed back toward them.  Medina, who testified for several hours Friday, said he and some friends, including one who was armed, were on 18th Street after being kicked out of a party nearby. They feared there were gang members in the car when they saw the sedan travel backward toward them, he said.  Medina and the teen he was with began to approach the car, when, prosecutors said, they realized the occupants of the car were older, and turned away. Medina testified that he put up a hand to show he wasn’t a threat.  During the trial, prosecutors showed surveillance video that showed Medina and the teen confer before walking toward the sedan when the gunfire started. During closing arguments, Janicki stopped the video to show Medina putting up his hand and the teen running away.  Advertisement  The teenager exchanged gunfire with the officers.  After the shooting, the video shows the officers get out of the car, but they did not approach Medina, who was on the ground clutching his back. A man who lived nearby testified that he had medical training and took Medina’s pulse and tried to pack the wounds.  Afternoon Briefing Weekdays Chicago Tribune editors' top story picks, delivered to your inbox each afternoon. By submitting your email to receive this newsletter, you agree to our Subscriber Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy >  Assistant State’s Attorney Thomas Fryska argued that Liakopoulos and Reynoso did not approach Medina or try to kick away a gun because they knew he was unarmed.  “It’s absolutely clear that the defendants knew Mr. Medina was unarmed,” Fryska said.  The officers’ attorneys, though, countered that Medina and the teen perpetrated a “coordinated ambush of Chicago police officers.” They argued that Medina lied at various points about his actions that night and early morning and that he worked together with the teen in the shooting.  The defense called one witness Wednesday, a city worker who was in a street sweeping truck that morning. The worker testified that he saw a man in a white hooded sweatshirt, which video indicated was Medina, with a gun, and then later saw him “exchanging something” with the teen.  Advertisement  “For the love of God, the whole world is upside down,” McKay said. “For any woke prosecutor out there or a civil rights lawyer know this, the law of Illinois does not say a police officer has to take a bullet before he can discharge a weapon.”  The case is among a handful in recent years in which the Cook County state’s attorney’s office has brought charges against local police officers in connection with allegations of unjustified force in on-duty incidents.  mabuckley@chicagotribune.com"

The Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) said officers responded to numerous 911 calls of a large group of teenagers moving through the city’s Center City neighborhood, rummaging through department stores in the area, including a Lululemon, Apple Store, and a Footlocker. Videos posted on social media showed the group, wearing hoodies and ski masks, running out of the Lululemon department store as officers on the scene tackled several of them on the sidewalk. Authorities also said the looters targeted stores in other areas, hitting a Rite-Aid, JD Sports department store and a T-Mobile, according to Philadelphia-based ABC affiliate WPVI-TV. The PPD added that another vehicle slammed into a Curaleaf marijuana dispensary store on the 5000 block of City Avenue in Wynnefield during the ordeal. According to officials, the looters traveled in a caravan of vehicles. At least 15 to 20 individuals were arrested. Police also recovered two weapons and noted that one of its vehicles suffered serious damage during the chase. The ransacking of stores happened the s ame U.S.-retailer Target announced that it will close stores in nine locations in four states due to ongoing theft and organized retail crime, according to Harrisburg-based ABC affiliate WHTM-TV. The retail giant said the incidents have threatened the safety of its workers and customers. The PPD told WPVI-TV that the incident was not related to an earlier protest over the fatal police shooting of Eddie Irizarry. “What we had tonight was a bunch of criminal opportunists take advantage of a situation and make an attempt to destroy our city,” Interim Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Stanford said in a statement.

Scott Maxwell: Newly appointed prosecutor Andrew Bain asks grand jury to probe deputy shooting. What you should know,9/27/23,2023-09-29T00:35:03Z,en,orlandosentinel.com,https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/09/27/osceola-police-shooting-baez-grand-jury-maxwell/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230929003503id_/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/09/27/osceola-police-shooting-baez-grand-jury-maxwell/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230929003503/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/09/27/osceola-police-shooting-baez-grand-jury-maxwell/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG9ybGFuZG9zZW50aW5lbCkvMjAyMy8wOS8yNy9vc2Nlb2xhLXBvbGljZS1zaG9vdGluZy1iYWV6LWdyYW5kLWp1cnktbWF4d2VsbA~~,"There are still a lot of questions about the case where Osceola County deputies shot and killed a teenager accused of shoplifting from Target last year.  The department says 19-year-old Jayden Baez used his car to try to escape and ram the officers’ vehicle. But Baez’s family has questioned the office’s version of events, saying it was suspicious that multiple officers waited more than a week to file reports on the same day at the same time with similar narratives. None of the officers were wearing body cameras to record what happened. The officers were in unmarked cars. And police experts have questioned the level of force for a case that involved $46 worth of pizza and trading cards.  Obviously anyone who tries to hurt a cop is asking for trouble. But new prosecutor Andrew Bain says he agrees the case deserves a fuller vetting. So he’s sending it to a grand jury.  That could be good for accountability. Or it could be just political theater.  Grand juries, after all, can be powerful investigative tools. But they can also be patsies for prosecutors who want to pass the buck, since they’re enshrouded in secrecy unlike any other part of America’s justice system. Prosecutors control the show behind closed doors.  Still, Bain seems to be taking some steps for bolstering public confidence — including one that could peel back some of the secrecy. We’ll see how it plays out. Here’s what you need to know:  For starters, no other jury process works like grand juries where the public is not only banned from watching the proceedings, but participants, including the jurors themselves, are typically banned from ever discussing what happened.  This has raised red flags in the past — like the time a grand jury in Florida let child predator Jeffrey Epstein off easy when charges were first filed.  New York prosecutors would later send Epstein to prison. But no one ever heard what Florida prosecutors told their grand jury the first time — when Epstein walked away with a deal so lax, he was able to work in his office during his 13-month sentence.  Even when prosecutors tell the public what supposedly happened in a grand jury room, you don’t know if it’s the full story. Several years ago in Minnesota, a juror filed a lawsuit, begging for the right to speak publicly about what happened in the grand jury room after claiming the prosecutor had misrepresented what she and her fellow jurors had done behind closed doors. She was denied that right to speak.  For all those reasons, some prosecutors avoid grand juries, particularly in police shootings. As one Minneapolis prosecutor said: “I will make that decision. That’s my job.”  That said, grand juries can also be powerful tools to get to the truth, since they have the power to compel testimony and collect evidence.  Put it all together and Andrew Leipold, an expert in grand jury process at the University of Illinois College of Law, said grand juries can be incredibly effective at truth-vetting, yet also instruments of prosecutorial whim. “If the prosecutor doesn’t want an indictment,” Leipold said, “there’s not going to be an indictment.”  Leipold said the secrecy is a double-edged sword but that prosecutors can address public distrust by asking grand juries to issue reports that explain why they did what they did. I like that idea. And Bain says he may do just that.  In a new office policy on police-force cases, Bain says he will ask grand jurors if they want to make a statement at the conclusion of the case — either about the case itself or future policies they want to recommend.  Mark NeJame, the attorney for Baez’s family, said he also found it encouraging that Bain’s office told the Baez legal team they can send their own law-enforcement expert to address the grand jury. NeJame knows a prosecutor doesn’t have to do that. “All we want is the truth and to know what really happened,” NeJame said. “The families deserve to know. And the public deserves to know.”  Bain’s chief assistant, Ryan Williams, says the new Orange-Osceola state attorney agrees. “The State Attorney is committed to transparency and understands, as the policy repeatedly references, the toll these use of force incidents take on communities and officers alike,” Williams said. “This policy is our attempt to navigate a difficult situation and the interests involved with those values in mind.”  We’ll see how it all plays out. But so far, that sounds encouraging.  I should say before concluding that I believe Bain has no business being in this office the way he got there. Gov. Ron DeSantis usurped democracy and invalidated a legally held election when he decided to remove a duly elected public official who had broken no laws — even as DeSantis allowed his own appointees, like his former ethics commissioner, to remain in office while clearly violating state statutes.  If you’d read about some third-world dictator deciding to simply overrule local election results, you’d shake your head and think of a banana republic. If Bain has good ideas, he should make his case before the people and run for the office — just as Monique Worrell did.  But for now, he’s the state attorney. And so far, it’s encouraging to see him saying the right things about both accountability and transparency. Now we’ll just have to see how it plays out — in a format that doesn’t always foster either.  smaxwell@orlandosentinel.com"

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Baltimore Sun.  The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office will not bring charges against the officer who fatally shot Tyree Moorehead last year, as the Baltimore activist threatened a woman with a knife.  Baltimore Police Officer Zachary Rutherford fired 14 shots at Moorehead on Nov. 6, 2022, striking him 13 times, after Moorehead brandished a knife near a woman’s face.  Advertisement  Moorehead, 48, was a local rapper known for spray-painting the phrase “No Shoot Zone” at the sites of Baltimore murders. In the months before his death, family and friends said his mental health had declined and his behavior became increasingly erratic.  In a report from the Public Trust and Police Integrity Unit of the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office, prosecutors wrote that Moorehead was threatening a woman with a large knife when police arrived and that after officers ordered Moorehead to “get down,” he threw himself on top of her and held the knife near her face.  Advertisement  When Rutherford fired, he had a “reasonable belief” that Moorehead was armed and presented “an imminent threat to the life of the” woman, the office’s 16-page report said. The report said there was sufficient evidence to support that Rutherford‘s use of deadly force was justified and that his decision was “objectively reasonable” to protect the woman from danger or serious injury.  The Maryland Attorney General’s Independent Investigations Division, which investigates all fatal police shootings in Maryland and, on Oct. 1, will gain the power to prosecute officers, did not recommend if any officers should be charged its report released Tuesday. In a section of the report analyzing potential charges, investigators wrote Moorehead’s knife was 9 inches long and body-camera footage showed he was holding the weapon just inches from the woman’s face when Rutherford fired.  “There is no doubt that she was in imminent danger of serious physical injury or death when Officer Rutherford began shooting,” the state report said, adding there was “no reasonable alternative method” Rutherford could have used besides deadly force.  Rutherford joined the Baltimore Police Department on March 21, 2022, less than seven months before the shooting. Before that, he worked for the Maryland Transit Administration Police for three years. The Baltimore County Police Department hired him in June 2018, but he resigned before finishing the academy, according to the state report.

It would be possible to find that Rutherford’s final shot violated the state’s use-of-force statute, if prosecutors could prove Moorehead no longer posed a threat to police or the woman when Rutherford fired again, the report said.  At least five people, including Moorehead’s father, called 911 on Nov. 6 and reported Moorehead was brandishing a knife at a woman near the corner of North Fulton and West Lafayette avenues.  The woman told investigators said Moorehead asked her for water, then dragged her into the street by her purse. He told her, “I’m going to kill you; stop moving,” as she unsuccessfully cried out for help.  Officers arrived at 3:40 p.m. and saw Moorehead holding a knife near the woman, who was then sitting on the ground. When police yelled at Moorehead to “get down,” he instead lunged on top of the woman and held the knife near her face, according to the attorney general’s report.  Advertisement  Rutherford began shooting at Moorehead, who rolled off the woman and onto his back. After Rutherford had fired 13 shots, Moorehead reached out his right hand, holding the knife, while lying on the ground. After a two-second pause, Rutherford fired his 14th shot; yelled, “Shots fired, shots fired”; and reloaded.  He continued to yell at Moorehead to “drop the knife,” which Moorehead did about 27 seconds after the final shot, investigators wrote. Moorehead was pronounced dead at 4:04 p.m at the University of Maryland Medical Center.  A ballistics review found 14 cartridge casings from Rutherford’s weapon at the scene. One of the 13 bullets found in Moorehead’s body was from a prior injury, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner determined."

He survived and was discharged from a hospital on Monday.  The victim, a 30-year-old woman, sustained minor injuries during the attack, was evaluated by paramedics but declined to go to the hospital, authorities said.

Upon arrival, officers spoke to a woman outside who said there was a woman in the basement who needed help.  The homeowner confirmed that a man and woman lived in the basement. Officers attempted to speak to the downstairs residents through the basement door.  An officer outside the home saw a man holding a knife to a woman’s throat through a basement window. Due to the nature of the situation, the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS) and a regional SWAT team were called to the scene.  During negotiation efforts, the man grew “increasingly agitated” and refused to drop the knife or follow instructions, according to authorities.  Two members of NIPAS discharged their firearms, hitting the suspect.  Members from NIPAS were able to rescue the victim from the man’s grip, the release said.

With President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador’s term ending next year, family members face not only the prospect of a ninth year of not knowing what happened to their sons but fears that the next administration will start the error-plagued investigation over from scratch yet again. In 2014, a group of students were attacked by municipal police in the southern city of Iguala, Guerrero, who handed them over to a local drug gang that apparently killed them and burned their bodies. Since the Sept. 26 attack, only three of their remains have been identified. After an initial coverup, last year a government truth commission concluded that local, state and federal authorities colluded with the gang to murder the students in what it called a âstate crime.â Ulises Gutierrez Solano joined the march in honor of his brother, Aldo, a student who survived the initial kidnapping but was left in a âvegetative stateâ since 2014 after police shot him in the head while the others students were being abducted. âThis is an atrocity to humanity, to society,â said Solano. âHow could they do so much harm to so many people?â LÃ³pez Obrador had pledged to solve the case and recent years have seen a painstakingly slow release of documents from the abduction, as well as a slew of arrests. But activists and human rights organizations say the government has not done enough to atone for the murders, investigate exactly what happened, and punish the culprits. Tensions rose just hours before the march, when the families and their lawyers rejected a series of documents the Mexican government offered to make public, claiming the specific military files they requested months ago were not included. The army said it didn’t have those files. âSince August the families have been asking, but they just gave us part of the informationâ said Nicholas MendÃ©z, leading a group of students from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. âThatâs worrying because weâre changing government next year.â LÃ³pez Obradorâs six-year term ends in September 2024 and, MendÃ©z feared, petitioning a new president for information could mean starting from scratch. âWe canât have another six years of nothing,â MendÃ©z said. In a press conference Tuesday morning, Mexico’s president insisted all of the relevant documents had been released. âWe have principles; we have ideals, and we speak the truth,â LÃ³pez Obrador said, promising also to publish government social media messages about the case. The students from a radical teachers’ college had travelled to Iguala to hijack buses to get to a protest in Mexico City, but were intercepted by corrupt police linked to the Guerreros Unidos gang. Iguala officials thought the students were going to disrupt a local political event, and one of the hijacked buses may have carried a drug shipment. Recent years have seen a run of government and army officials from the time arrested, but no more remains have been found. Then-Attorney General, JesÃºs Murillo Karam, and the head of his anti-kidnapping unit have been arrested for their initial, botched investigation following the abductions. Almost a dozen military personnel, including the commander of the area where the students were abducted, have also been arrested. After evidence used to assemble an expert report in August was undermined, the caseâs chief prosecutor, Omar GÃ³mez Trejo, resigned. Just this year a party from the Inter-American Human Rights Commission which has been investigating the incident since 2015 also withdrew from Mexico. As families marched through the city, they passed barricades erected to protect monuments. The march was peaceful, notwithstanding isolated incidents of violence when demonstrators attacked and damaged some stores, according to local media. At one traffic circle, activists had plastered posters in remembrance not just of the 43 students, but of all Mexicoâs missing. The Ayotzinapa atrocity has taken on symbolic significance for a country with more than 110,000 missing people. Pablo Hector Gonzalez has traveled from Guerrero every year to join the march. âAfter nine years, in force, we will insist until the truth appears and until all the guilty are punished,â he said."

The action deepened the sense of crisis in Britain's largest police force, which is struggling to restore public confidence after a series of scandals and an independent review that found it was riddled with institutional racism, sexism and homophobia. Commissioner Mark Rowley, who heads the Metropolitan Police Service, called for greater clarity on the rules governing the use of lethal force and legal protections for officers when they make split-second decisions to fire their weapons. But that only fueled the concerns of some campaigners who said there is already a ''lack of accountability'' in the police force. ''Police cannot be judge, jury and executioner and must not be above the law,'' said Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, a charity focused on state-related deaths. Rowley's proposal ''would make accountability for police use of force virtually impossible, effectively giving firearms officers a license to kill,'' she added. ''That cannot be in the public interest.'' The police department, known as the Met, has more than 34,000 officers, about 2,500 of whom are licensed to carry firearms. Some firearms officers decided not to carry their guns after prosecutors last week filed murder charges against an officer who was involved in the shooting of an unarmed Black man in south London on Sept. 5, 2022. Chris Kaba, 24, died after he was struck by a single gunshot fired into the car he was driving. The BBC reported that as many as 300 officers had laid down their firearms. The Met didn't confirm that number, saying only that ''a number of officers'' had stepped back from armed duties in recent days as they reviewed the implications of the charging decision for themselves and their families. The department said it was having discussions with the officers and some have already returned to firearms duties. On Saturday, the Ministry of Defense agreed to provide backup for counter-terrorism operations, but that was no longer needed by midday on Monday, the Met said. A ''limited number'' of armed officers from other departments are still providing assistance in other areas of policing. Home Secretary Suella Braverman, whose department oversees policing, on Sunday announced a review of the rules governing police use of force. Rowley wrote to Braverman later in the day, calling for increased legal protections for officers. While Rowley acknowledged that police must be held to the highest standards, he said current rules are cumbersome and leave officers at risk of prosecution even when they follow their training. ''We rely on officers who are willing to put themselves at risk on a daily basis to protect the public from dangerous criminals including terrorists,'' Rowley said. ''Officers need sufficient legal protection to enable them to do their job and keep the public safe, and the confidence that it will be applied consistently and without fear or favor.'' Rowley stressed that officer-involved shootings are very rare in London. London police respond to about 4,000 armed incidents every year, with officers firing their weapons less than twice a year on average, Rowley said in his letter to Braverman. That means that 0.05% of armed operations result in shots fired by police, he said. The tensions over armed officers comes as Rowley tries to rebuild public confidence in his force following a series of scandals, including a serving officer who was convicted of kidnapping and murdering a young woman in 2021. Rowley, who took the top job last year, has made it a priority to root out bad officers and improve training after an independent review found widespread racism, misogyny and homophobia in the department. Restoring public trust is crucial for the Met because British law enforcement is based on the idea of ''policing by consent,'' which means most officers don't carry guns and they rely on the public to respect their authority. Rowley said police should be held to the ''highest standards,'' but the current system leaves good officers facing lengthy investigations and legal proceedings even when they follow their training. ''There is a concern on the part of firearms officers that even if they stick to the tactics and training they have been given, they will face years of protracted legal proceedings which impact on their personal wellbeing and that of their family,'' Rowley said. Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police in northern England, said that the action by firearms officers was symptomatic of a wider discontent among officers and a lack of confidence in the Home Office and the Independent Office of Police Conduct. But he said that police understand that they are subject to criminal law in the same way as any other member of the public. ''The law is clear, the stated cases are clear, and I think those firearms officers absolutely fundamentally understand that because it's part of their training,â³ Fahy told the BBC. ''As I say, this is really symptomatic of a wider discontent that officers feel that they're misunderstood and unappreciated.''"

There is clear evidence in the number of officers shot in the line of duty: As of Sept. 4, 272 law enforcement officers were shot in the line of duty throughout the United States, and of those, 34 were killed by gunfire, according to a report from the National Fraternal Order of Police. The number of officers shot is up 25% compared to the same time period in 2020, the report found. In Illinois so far this year, eight police officers were shot in the line of duty. Texas, with 21 officers shot, leads the nation.  Just within the last month, there is no more explicit example of how the system is failing law enforcement than what happened in San Antonio, Texas: Over 12 days, six police officers were shot in six separate incidents. Every one of the offenders arrested was either out on bond, on electronic monitoring, on early release, parole, or probation or was released from bond court on their recognizance. This must stop.  Ambush attacks — 83 have happened so far this year — are especially disturbing; one example is the attack against a Los Angeles County deputy recently.  Opinion bug Opinion  A December 2017 study by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services examined law enforcement officer fatalities from 2010 through 2016, including ambush attacks. Of the 81 officers killed in ambushes during that period, 15% were just sitting in their patrol car, sometimes on their break, when they were shot. That’s true lawlessness.  The risk of attacks is greater when violent suspects are let out rather than remaining in custody.  Attacks are not ‘part of the job’  Officers are always at risk of life-threatening attacks, and every attack on an officer, especially by gunfire, is disturbing. Some will say, “That’s part of the job,” but that is untrue. Police officers never join the profession so that they can be shot in the line of duty, injured, or killed. Officers know the dangers, but politicians, the court system, and prosecutors must stop making it impossible for law enforcement to carry out their sworn duty.  Where can we start to ensure that police are not being assaulted daily? First, locally and nationally, politicians must stop holding news conferences, issuing press releases, and holding impromptu interviews at crime scenes, calling for “criminal justice reform” — which can too easily equate to no accountability. Many police officers say that, in their experience, violent criminals no longer fear prosecution — being arrested, being held in custody, going to trial or receiving a stiff sentence if convicted.  Second, prosecutors should focus on prosecuting crime. That is their job, not “reform.” Third, the court system must do its job. With the SAFE-T Act here in Illinois, which includes the end of cash bond, the jury’s out on that one. But based on my experience, some parts of the SAFE-T Act — specifically, eliminating cash bond altogether — will not go well (though if I am wrong, I will be the first to admit it).  This is not about Republican, Democrat, Independent, social status, economic status, or even where you live. Crime is crime. It affects all of us. No one should fear leaving home and hearing gunshots, or witnessing or being victimized in a robbery, carjacking, or homicide.  Law enforcement officers sign up to serve the community. They want to be part of the community and share their answers on how to help the community they serve thrive. Residents can help by demanding that those responsible for crime, including assaulting police officers, be held fully accountable.

In another, a woman claims she was strip-searched, with an officer using a flashlight to scan her body.

In 2021, a corruption probe into the department’s narcotics division led to criminal charges and internal discipline against officers accused of stealing drugs from evidence and lying on police reports. Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul, who was hired to lead the agency in the wake of Sterling’s killing, said he was so concerned over the recent warehouse claims that he drove to the FBI’s New Orleans field division and asked them to review the allegations. “There were some mistakes made,” Paul told The Associated Press, acknowledging that his internal affairs division initially failed to investigate. “I promise you we will get to the bottom of this.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad The most recent lawsuit, which attorneys filed earlier this week on behalf of Ternell Brown, alleges officers pulled her over in June, took her to the same “black site” and strip-searched her for “contraband.” She was released without charges when officers concluded the prescription drugs in her possession were legal.

Shortly after Lee’s lawsuit, Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome ordered the warehouse closed, saying she was previously unaware of the facility’s existence. “The severity of these allegations deeply concerns me, especially given the potential impact on the trust our community places in us,” Broome said.

The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) released a pair of 33-minute videos from the perspective of the two officers — Stephen Gigante, who fired his service revolver, and Felix DeJesus Jr., who fired a taser — who were confronted by the 52-year-old Washington Aug. 27. The also released two audio recordings.  Washington, whose family said suffers from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, was mostly unresponsive to calls from Gigante, who is seen in the videos doing most of the talking, repeatedly saying he wants to make sure Washington is “good.” The few times Washington responded to the officer, he told him to leave.  “You got to get a fair chance for a fight,” Washington repeatedly chanted.  “Can you come show me your face so I know you are good?” Gigante said soon after. “You are not in trouble. You are not under arrest. ... You sound like you are having a bad day?”  Police did not notify Washington they were coming in and when Gigante kicked the door open, Washington was already holding the knife, the video shows. When Washington lunged through the doorway, both officers fired, the video shows. The officers continued to yell “drop the knife” at Washington, and one minute and 20 seconds later EMTs were called up the stairs.  Washington was pronounced dead a hour later at the Jersey City Medical Center. His death has sparked outrage in the community about how police respond to people in a mental health crisis. Last year the city approved the creation of a mental health crisis response program, the city has not been able to find an operator.  Family members and community activists march on City Hall Wednesday and held a rally outside prior to the city council meeting.  The shooting is under investigation by the OAG’s Office of Public Integrity and Accountability (OPIA), according to the press release with a link to the videos and radio transmissions. (The video files are each 1.3GB and you may need to download the Box app to view them.)  The radio transmissions refer to the shooting as not life-threatening more than once, but when asked for an update on Washington’s condition a short time later, an officer said Washington was in the (hospital) trauma room and “they” were “trying to bring him back.”  Washington’s family saw the footage Friday before it was released publicly, and his aunt said in a text message to The Jersey Journal that people will “learn very little about Andrew Jerome Washington III” after watching the videos.  “We want you to know how he lived,” Ervin said.”Together we faced every challenge mental illness forced on Drew and we watched him fight his way back to health and recovery. He was a man of integrity, faith and highly intelligent. Drew was so loving, compassionate, thoughtful, stylish, incredibly funny, and kind …  “He needed medical treatment. Medical treatment that would have allowed him the opportunity to win this last battle with his mental illness. And now we are in the depths of grief over losing him.”  The family had called the Jersey City Medical Center’s (JCMC) psychiatric unit for a wellness check on Washington. But EMTs determined it was unsafe to enter and police were then summoned to the scene, which began an hour-long engagement that led the police to consider him a danger to himself and others.  It could not be determined from the video why the police officers kicked in the door when they did, but a few minutes earlier, Gigante was told that Washington was a heavy smoker and he didn’t sound so well. At one point a few minutes before kicking in the door, Gigante asks DeJesus “Did you hear something like a knife?”  Mayor Steve Fulop and Public Safety Director James Shea held a press conference the day after the shooting and they described the shooting as justified. Fulop added that he was anxious for the AG’s Office to release the footage as he stood by the officers, who he said“acted properly.”  City spokeswoman Kimberly Wallace-Scalcione could not be reached for comment Friday night.  Critics of the police response say police knew Washington, who was shot by police in a similar episode 11 years ago, had mental health issues and they had responded to the home seven times recently.  Family members and others say Washington would still be alive if the city had its mental health crisis response program up and running. The city’s initial request for proposals to operate a mental health crisis response program received no bids, while a second request received one offer from a vendor who came in more than three times higher than the $1.2 million budgeted by the city.  But even with a program in place, Fulop and Shea have previously said the situation was too dangerous for EMS or mental health professionals to engage because a weapon was involved, but they have not said how they were aware that Washington had a knife."

According to a Hawaii island police report, officers responded around 11:45 p.m. Friday to a call reporting an argument between two brothers, one of whom was armed, at a home on 34th Avenue in the Orchidland Estates subdivision in Keaau. The 30-year-old armed suspect fled on foot and officers issued an “all-points bulletin” for the man, who also had an outstanding arrest warrant. At about 2:30 p.m. today, Big Island police received information about the suspect’s possible whereabouts on the “dead-end side” of 26th Avenue in Hawaiian Paradise Park subdivision in Keaau. “When they arrived, the officers heard noises from inside the house and announced their presence, ordering the male to exit the house and surrender,” according to a Hawaii County police news release. “The suspect fled from the back of the house and ran into a heavily wooded vacant neighboring property on 27th Avenue.” Officers chased the suspect and ordered him to stop but he “ignored officers’ commands and continued running through the woods,” police said. “As four officers chased after him, the suspect turned and fired the handgun at the officers. Fearing their lives were in danger, the officers took cover in the brush and shouted commands for the suspect to surrender,” police said. “The suspect suddenly emerged from the brush and began firing at the officers again. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect.” Police said the officers attempted to perform first-aid on the suspect but he died at the scene. No one else was injured in the incident. Hawaii island police said its Office of Professional Standards has opened a “critical incident review.” The officers involved — a detective with 17 years on the police force, another detective with 11 years of service, and two patrol officers with five years and one year on the force — have been placed on administrative leave. Police say anyone who witnessed the shooting should call the department’s non-emergency line at 808-935-3311 or contact Detective Donovan Kohara at 808-326-4646, extension 238, or at Donovan.Kohara@hawaiicounty.gov."

In late August, family and neighbors of Washington reported he’d been acting erratically and hadn’t been seen for several days. Washington’s aunt said he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at a young age. Police and emergency personnel showed up at his apartment in the Bergen-Lafayette section of the city and attempted to coax him out, but ended up fatally shooting him after a brief scuffle.  Since then family and supporters have been demanding to see footage of the incident.  Videos released by New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin’s office show Jersey City’s Emergency Services Unit arriving at Washington’s home at around 2:56 p.m. on Sunday, August 27th, after first responders call for backup.  According to information provided by Platkin’s office, the family first called for emergency medical services for help with Washington, 52, who was refusing to open the door to his apartment and appeared to be in the middle of a mental health crisis. Responders then requested help from the Jersey City Police Department who were unable to get Washington to comply and open the door to his apartment.  The body camera video recording started when officers from the Emergency Services Unit — which is trained in de-escalation — arrived and set up outside of Washington’s door, ready with shields and gear to break it down.  For more than 30 minutes, Officer Stephen Gigante is heard pleading with Washington, who was inside his apartment with the door locked, and who continued to demand that officers leave the building.  Gigante, along with other officers at the scene, seemed to know Washington and referred to a prior incident when they were able to get him to comply with them.  “Remember us? I’m willing to work with you. How can we help you out today?” Officer Gigante said. “I know sometimes people feel intimidated with the police at their door but we are just trying to help.”  “I am not your slave! I am not your slave!” Washington can be heard yelling back.  Another officer leaves to retrieve a taser from a patrol car. At this point, an onlooker who had their face blurred in the video says, “You know, just tase him. Don’t shoot him,” with a nervous laugh.  Back outside Washington’s apartment door, officers say they hear him continuously coughing and ask if he needs medical help. He can be heard saying “shooting” and “suicide,” though not in an audible sentence.  After some back and forth and periods of silence, Gigante breaks down the door, 32 minutes into the standoff.  At that moment, Washington, who was right near the door, runs toward the officers with what appears to be a knife in his hand. Officer Felix DeJesus fires the Taser, striking Washington, and Gigante says he shot Washington twice, though it’s not clear from the video.  After Washington is down, Gigante continues to tell him to stop moving and to drop the knife. The video recording ends when Gigante calls EMS for medical assistance. “He’s been tased and shot,” he tells them.  Doris Ervin, Washington’s aunt, told Gothamist last month that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at around 26-years-old.  Ervin called medical services on Sunday after he'd been missing for a few days. One neighbor said Washington had been yelling a lot more at the time and was talking about alien attacks.  Ervin said she was first told her nephew was just tased, and believed he was being processed for psychiatric treatment. She didn’t learn until hours later that he had been shot and had died.  Ervin said she regretted calling for help that day.  “We were afraid for his well-being, and we really wanted him to get help because of his illness,” she said. “And I kind of feel bad now that we did. We should have just left it alone.”  This shooting is still under investigation and is being conducted under a state law that requires that the AG’s office look into any death at the hands of a police officer, and release any video or audio recorded by law enforcement to the public."

Jesse Hartsock of the Maryland State Police for the shooting death of Jack C. Cimino Jr., 52, of Sykesville. “We believe, based upon our comprehensive review, that the use of deadly force by Sgt. Hartsock, after nearly a 10-hour barricade/standoff situation, was reasonable, necessary, and proportional, given the totality of the circumstances, to prevent an imminent threat to him and others,” the email states. Thomas Lester, public information officer in the Office of the Attorney General, said Friday that a redacted copy of its investigative report into the incident would be released within 30 days. On Aug. 11 the Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland State Attorney General’s Office released body camera footage from the shooting. [ Maryland AG releases body camera footage from fatal police shooting of Sykesville man in June ] Three videos were posted on YouTube, showing three perspectives of the incident at an apartment on Liberty Road in Sykesville. The incident began about 9 p.m. June 3, when state police responded to a report that a man had called a crisis hotline threatening to commit suicide. When they arrived at the apartment, state troopers attempted to make contact with Cimino, then declared a barricade, bringing in the state police, along with SWATand crisis negotiation teams throughout the night, according to an attorney general’s office news release. A 10-hour standoff followed, ending at about 7 a.m., June 4, when Hartsock shot Cimino. Cimino was taken to a hospital where he died. Hartsock, who has worked with the state police for 15 years and is assigned to the Field Operations Bureau, was moved to an administrative role following the shooting, per department policy, according to Maryland State Police spokesperson Ron Snyder. Hartsock remains on administrative leave as of Friday, according to the state police. Shoemaker stated in the email that his office’s investigation included examining Brown’s report, information from the Maryland State Police, witness statements from civilians and law enforcement, body-worn camera footage, videos, photographs, and an autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Shoemaker also reviewed a report from the Independent Investigations Division as well as applicable law, including state police policies and procedures. Shoemaker said the events of June 4 were tragic. “Nonetheless, Sgt. Hartsock was faced with an imminent deadly threat from Mr. Cimino and his actions were entirely justified,” he said. “The MSP attempted to de-escalate the situation for over 10 hours. During the negotiations, there were at least 12 requests that Mr. Cimino disarm. “Numerous troopers spoke to Mr. Cimino by telephone and in person and assured him that they were there to help him,” he said. “The Maryland State Police discussed the use of less lethal force. Unfortunately, due to the distance between troopers and the location of Mr. Cimino, it was determined that the option of less lethal force was not advisable because of the lethal threat posed by Mr. Cimino.” Shoemaker said from the start, Cimino made threats to shoot any law enforcement officers who were there. “The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner autopsy/toxicology report stated that Mr. Cimino had a blood alcohol level of 0.19 and had Xanax in his system at the time of his death,” he said. Several times Cimino said he could “see troopers behind the BEARCAT,” which is an armored vehicle used by the SWAT team, and that “he was going to shoot them. “On numerous occasions troopers observed Mr. Cimino exit his home with knives and then a handgun and act in an aggressive manner,” Shoemaker said. Carroll County Breaking News Shoemaker said Cimino became more agitated and more aggressive as the standoff went on and that Cimino aimed a black handgun at police, which was found near his body. According to an obituary posted by Burrier-Queen Funeral Home, Cimino was a longtime member and volunteer in the Sykesville Volunteer Fire Department, beginning as a junior member in his early teens. He worked in the emergency response and health care field, most recently as a phlebotomist for 27 years, according to the obituary."
"Biases against Black-sounding first names can lead to discrimination in hiring, especially when employers make decisions in a hurry − new research",9/22/23,2023-09-27T14:44:14Z,en,sfgate.com,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/biases-against-black-sounding-first-names-can-18382238.php,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927144414id_/https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/biases-against-black-sounding-first-names-can-18382238.php,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927144414/https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/biases-against-black-sounding-first-names-can-18382238.php,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNmZ2F0ZSkvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL2JpYXNlcy1hZ2FpbnN0LWJsYWNrLXNvdW5kaW5nLWZpcnN0LW5hbWVzLWNhbi0xODM4MjIzOC5waHA~,"(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) (THE CONVERSATION) Because names are among the first things you learn about someone, they can influence first impressions. That this is particularly true for names associated with Black people came to light in 2004 with the release of a study that found employers seeing identical resumes were 50% more likely to call back an applicant with stereotypical white names like Emily or Greg versus applicants with names like Jamal or Lakisha. Advertisement Article continues below this ad I’m a behavioral economist who researches discrimination in labor markets. In a study based on a hiring experiment I conducted with another economist, Rulof Burger, we found that participants systematically discriminated against job candidates with names they associated with Black people, especially when put under time pressure. We also found that white people who oppose affirmative action discriminated more than other people against job candidates with distinctly Black names, whether or not they had to make rushed decisions. Detecting racial biases To conduct this study, we recruited 1,500 people from all 50 U.S. states in 2022 to participate in an online experiment on Prolific, a survey platform. The group was nationally representative in terms of race and ethnicity, age and gender. We first collected data on their beliefs about the race and ethnicity, education, productivity and personality traits of people with six names picked from a pool of 2,400 workers whom we hired in an early stage of our experiment for a transcription task. Data from these individual responses made it possible for us to categorize how they perceived the candidates. Advertisement Article continues below this ad We found that the names of workers perceived as Black, such as Shanice or Terell, were more likely to elicit negative presumptions, such as being less educated, productive, trustworthy and reliable, than people with either white-sounding names, such as Melanie or Adam, or racially ambiguous names, such as Krystal or Jackson. We were specifically studying discrimination against Black people, so we did not include names in this experiment that are frequently associated with Hispanics or Asians. Participants were next presented with pairs of names and were told they could earn money for selecting the worker who was more productive in the transcription task. The chance that they would choose job candidates they perceived to be white because of their names was almost twice as high than if they thought the candidates to be Black. This tendency to discriminate against people with Black-sounding names was greatest among men, people over 55, whites and conservatives. Educational attainment, the level of racial diversity in the participants’ ZIP codes or whether they had personally hired anyone before didn’t influence their apparent biases. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Rushing can cause more discriminatory behavior Most real-world hiring managers spend less than 10 seconds reviewing each resume during the initial screening stage. To keep up that swift pace, they may resort to using mental shortcuts – including racial stereotypes – to assess job applications. We found that requiring the study participants to select a worker within only 2 seconds led them to be 25% more likely to discriminate against candidates with names they perceived as Black-sounding. Similar patterns of biased decision-making under time pressure have been documented in the context of police shootings and medical decisions. However, making decisions more slowly is not a panacea. Advertisement Article continues below this ad We found that the most important factor for whether more deliberate decisions reduce discrimination was a participant’s view on affirmative action – the consideration of race in a workforce or student body to ensure that their share of people of color is roughly proportionate to the general public or a local community. White participants who opposed affirmative action were more than twice as likely to select an applicant with a white-sounding name compared with applicants perceived as Black – whether or not they had to make the simulated hiring decision in a hurry. By contrast, giving white participants who favor affirmative action unlimited time to choose a name from the hiring list reduced discrimination against the job candidates with names they perceived as Black-sounding by almost half. The data showed that this decline had to do with people basing their decision more on their perceptions of a worker’s performance, rather than relying on mental shortcuts based on their perceived race. We assessed the participants’ views on affirmative action by doing a survey at the end of this experiment. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Discrimination hasn’t gone away A study published in 2021 suggested that hiring discrimination based on Black-souding names had declined, although discriminatory practices remained high in some customer-facing lines of work, such as auto sales or retail. Other research has suggested that once people learn more about someone, the discriminatory influence that a name might have begins to fade. Yet, other studies have indicated that racial biases can make the interactions needed for this learning process less likely. For example, racial biases may lead employers to refrain from interviewing – or hiring – a job candidate of color in the first place. There is ample evidence that people of color face discrimination in many important domains beyond employment, including finding housing or obtaining loans. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Our results suggest that slowing down the initial assessment of applicants can be a first step toward reducing this type of discrimination.

Roth’s recent commentary in The Baltimore Sun (“College students were ‘woke’ in the ‘60s, annoying to elders and drivers of social change; meet their successors,” Sept. 18) brought back vivid images of being in college at American University in Washington, D.C. from 1967 to 1971. The opposition to the war in Vietnam was rampant among D.C. college students then. We didn’t consider ourselves “woke,” we considered ourselves anti-war activists. College students from all over the country converged on our campus and on all the D.C. college campuses, sleeping on the floors of any building that allowed it. One of my memories was when I was going into my dorm spring of my junior year when a friend of mine from the College Young Democrats shocked me in the lobby. He went to Kent State. I told him I was worried about him, and he said I should have been. He was there! He could have been shot by police. I was at the protest at the Washington Monument with thousands of other college students, not just from the D.C., but from campuses all over the country. Another memory was when there was a huge protest on a hill at Ward Circle on the edge of our campus. Police stationed themselves with tear gas to break it up. I ran as fast as I could before the tear gas could get me. Lastly, boys who had no plans for graduate school suddenly took the standardized admissions tests to get student deferments from the war.

Inside the warehouse, officers punched and kicked him while he screamed for help, the lawsuit alleges. After he was violently interrogated and arrested, the only criminal charge prosecutors pursued against Lee was resisting arrest.  Shortly after Lee’s lawsuit, Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome ordered the warehouse closed, saying she was previously unaware of the facility’s existence.  “The severity of these allegations deeply concerns me, especially given the potential impact on the trust our community places in us,” Broome said.  Thomas Frampton, an attorney representing both Lee and Brown, said his team has heard from dozens more people alleging abuse inside the warehouse and they plan to file additional lawsuits.  “This kind of misconduct is so entrenched that people had little reason to expect any kind of positive change,” he said, praising the FBI’s decision to launch an investigation.  ___  Mustian reported from Washington, Skene from Baltimore."

Price lacks experienced  prosecutors for cop cases  When Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price was elected, she promised she would reinvestigate six fatal police shootings and would have an answer as to an investigation and charges in 120 days.  That time has come and gone. Those cases were fully investigated during former District Attorney Nancy O’Malley’s tenure, and she and other experts, real experts, who had years of experience, decided they weren’t chargeable because there was no evidence.  Now, Price does not have the veteran, experienced prosecutors to investigate and prosecute these cases should she want to reopen them. The defense attorneys will have a field day with the rookie prosecutors she’s hired.  Ninfa Wood  Walnut Creek  Bad actors must be  held accountable  Re: “Court: School district violated religious freedom” (Page B2, Sept. 15).  Given the egregious violation by Pioneer High School and the behavior of social studies teacher Peter Glasser, I hope the parties involved above are held accountable.  As long as people in positions of authority can behave this way with no discernable consequences, they are likely to repeat offend.  I’d like to see punitive damages assessed against the bad actors involved to discourage this sort of behavior in the future.  Kevin Hickman  San Ramon  Flag ban doesn’t foster  tolerance, inclusivity  Re: “Chaos in Sunol after flag ban” (Page A1, Sept. 14).  Every child counts and needs to feel accepted and loved in order to thrive emotionally and develop healthy self-esteem.  Showing and teaching respect for self and others is critical from an early age. As a former teacher for over 20 years and a licensed marriage and family therapist, I repeatedly saw the long-term impacts on children and their families when this encouragement does not occur.  Banning pride flags from the Sunol Glen school grounds does not lead to tolerance or convey inclusiveness.  Penee Field-Feinberg  Fremont  Repeal utility tax  provision in SB 205  Re: “PG&E’s customers facing big bill increases” (Page B1, Sept. 15).  The Sept. 15 article emphasizes PG&E and the California Public Utility Commission’s (CPUC) disregard for low-income ratepayers’ struggles.  PG&E’s rate increases (42%) over the last five years versus Bay Area inflation (13.5%) were highlighted. Now the CPUC has issued two new 2023 rate-hike proposals, costing customers between $24 and $28 per month if either passes. Let’s not forget that in 2022, the Legislature passed AB 205, which mandates utilities (including PG&E) to charge all ratepayers a new utility tax. PG&E will be charging the highest utility tax in the country, between $35 and $125 per month, depending on household income, upon state PUC approval in 2024.  While bills are going up for millions of people who live in apartments, condos and small homes, where is the proposal for PG&E to reduce their executives’ compensation, totaling $40 million in FY2022? Tell your legislators to repeal the utility tax provision in AB 205.  Sandy White  Fremont  Push to make schools  climate-resilient  As a primary care physician here in the East Bay, who is concerned about climate change, I’m calling on Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign SB 394, which creates a master plan for climate-resilient schools. This bill will help craft our response to climate impacts like the climate-fueled wildfire smoke we are all breathing today. This bill passed the Legislature by a near-unanimous vote in each chamber.  Every new school facilities project is an opportunity to mitigate the effects on students and teachers of climate-related health hazards and disruptions, and to move the school closer to California’s target of net-zero emissions. Climate change is about health — this bill is a huge step in the right direction toward protecting our children’s health and future. Please contact Governor Newsom’s office and urge him to sign SB 394 to protect our kids.

LOUIS COUNTY — Police shot and injured a man while responding to a domestic incident Wednesday night in the Affton area of south St. Louis County.  Officials said the man fired at police, too, but no officers were injured.  Police were called just after 7 p.m. to the 9100 block of Rambler Drive, near Gravois Road, and were told the man had a gun and was threatening to harm police.  The man was sitting on a porch with a gun in each hand when police arrived, said St. Louis County Sgt. Tracy Panus. Police tried to talk with him, but when he raised one of the guns, he and two officers exchanged gunfire.  The man suffered life-threatening injuries.  “We always assume when we roll up on any scene that everyone is armed,” Panus said at a news briefing Wednesday night. “But knowing it when we go in, and knowing that someone has made those threats to harm us as soon as we get here, it definitely escalates the situation. So we are more aware of our surroundings. We’re more aware of the people that we’re working with, and we’re trying to … slow it down.”  Christine Tannous of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report."
Internal LAPD reports show body camera misuse more widespread than chief alleges,9/21/23,2023-09-27T07:56:07Z,en,latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-21/internal-lapd-reports-show-body-cam-misuse-issue-more-widespread-than-chief-alleges,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927075607id_/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-21/internal-lapd-reports-show-body-cam-misuse-issue-more-widespread-than-chief-alleges,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927075607/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-21/internal-lapd-reports-show-body-cam-misuse-issue-more-widespread-than-chief-alleges,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGxhdGltZXMpL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEvc3RvcnkvMjAyMy0wOS0yMS9pbnRlcm5hbC1sYXBkLXJlcG9ydHMtc2hvdy1ib2R5LWNhbS1taXN1c2UtaXNzdWUtbW9yZS13aWRlc3ByZWFkLXRoYW4tY2hpZWYtYWxsZWdlcw~~,"LAPD Chief Michel Moore, center, has repeatedly assured the public that the alleged body camera misuse among some Mission Division officers does not reflect a larger problem.  For weeks after the Mission Division scandal broke in late August, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore repeatedly framed the growing crisis as an isolated problem of rogue gang officers who flouted LAPD regulations by turning off their body-worn cameras at critical moments.  Moore said there was no evidence so far that other units were engaging in the more serious allegations facing Mission gang officers — who have been accused of theft, illegal stops and searches, and the use of Apple AirTags to track people, according to LAPD sources who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.  But an internal department report found that the body camera issue is more widespread than the department is letting on publicly.  Advertisement  The confidential report by command staff from the 77th Street Division said that patrol officers from that division, as well as from the Hollenbeck and Hollywood divisions, were also in the habit of turning off their cameras in violation of department policy.  One possible explanation for these lapses, the report says, is a “real perception” that exists among many officers that they are “somehow excused” from turning on their cameras in time to capture encounters with the public, so long as they can articulate a clear reason for not doing so.  At the same time, some supervisors are under the impression that they are only required to review officers’ body camera footage in a narrow set of situations, the report said.  “Anecdotally, when speaking with my supervisors including my Watch Commanders, they provided a few reasons why a ‘deep review or investigation isn’t customarily done,” a division leader says in the report, which was obtained by The Times. “The overall belief by the Watch Commanders and supervisors is that aside from the requirement to review [body-worn and dashboard camera footage] for Personnel Complaints, Use of Force and Pursuit Investigations, the role of reviewing [body-worn and dashboard cameras] for Audits, Inspections, and Compliance Reviews is the responsibility of the Bureau Inspections Units or teams.”  So-called quality service inspections of officers’ activity were suspended temporarily in March 2018 at the behest of the police union; a follow-up rule change said that such reviews could only be conducted by auditing units at the department’s four geographical bureaus and that they must be randomized.  Advertisement  The same audit did not turn up any body camera deviations at a fourth station, Foothill, a finding the report’s authors surmised might be the result of auditors not reading officers’ reports closely enough for language suggesting a possible deviation.  Officers in the other three divisions had noted in their reports why they failed to activate their cameras, but Foothill officers had not; only someone who reads an officers’ daily logs line-by-line would figure out that a violation had occurred, the report’s authors concluded.  Without addressing all of those issues, the report said that even with a greater emphasis on body camera compliance, officers would find other ways to get around the rules.  “If the expectation is that we should be conducting a deeper investigation into any documented ... deviation,” the report said, “I will tell you with confidence that officers will hear about this and will stop making these entries in the comments of their [reports] and no one would know any different unless their entry was selected as part of a random Bureau Inspection. If we want to make real progress, lets address this as well.”  LAPD rules don’t explicitly require supervisors to check body camera footage after they find a “deviation in the comments of [an officer’s] report,” and until recently, the report said, the department’s computer system couldn’t track whether such a review had been done.  The report said the department should consider studying the “feasibility” of adding to the workload of patrol supervisors, who are already tasked with the “voluminous work of reviewing [videos] ... for Use of Force and Pursuit Investigations and Complaint Intakes.”  After the controversy became public last month, Moore ordered additional training for all of the department’s gang units, and effectively disbanded the Mission gang unit, ordering two of its members to submit to disciplinary hearings for possible termination.  In the weeks since, Moore has on several occasions told reporters and the Police Commission — the department’s civilian bosses — that problems identified in Mission were confined to a single division, saying a broad review he’d ordered “found no evidence that this type of misconduct extends to any other division in the City.”  But even as he made public assurances, behind the scenes Moore ordered department auditors to start reviewing officers’ body camera videos for possible violations.  Auditors from the four geographical bureaus perform spot checks roughly  every four weeks by randomly reviewing gang unit stops “that don’t result in enforcement action.” Supervisors are supposed to ensure that an officer’s reports reflect what’s captured by their camera and look for potential red flags, including the use of canned language in reports and unexplained camera deactivations.  The department has since increased the frequency of these audits, according to LAPD spokesperson Capt. Kelly Muniz.  This has led to the discovery of scores of new violations, sources say.  According to two LAPD sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, a preliminary investigation turned up multiple body camera policy violations in a recent police shooting in Hollywood.  In the Sept. 9 incident, officers opened fire after a suspect started shooting toward a group of people outside a nightclub near the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Ivar Avenue, but no one was struck, police said. The alleged shooter, who hasn’t been identified, fled the scene and eventually eluded police in a high-speed chase.  When department officials reviewed police video from the scene, they found several so-called significantly involved officers were late to start recording or otherwise flouted the department’s body camera policy, according to sources.  A 2021 study by the department’s inspector general found that nearly a fourth of LAPD officers involved in incidents where serious force was used failed to activate their body cameras in a timely manner.  The report found that while the LAPD had ramped up inspections of body camera compliance among officers involved in serious uses of force, the department could be doing more to ensure officers are consistently activating their cameras and keeping them powered on while in the field.  A Times examination of department reports stemming from recent police shootings found that in many cases, officers were still failing to record their encounters with the public.  Of 37 police shootings that have gone before the civilian commission over the last year, 25 cases had some type of body camera violation by officers who were considered to be substantially involved, the Times review found.  These deviations included officers delaying to turn on their cameras, turning them off prematurely or failing to activate them entirely, as required. In another two shootings, some officers’ recordings did not include a full two-minute buffering period, which is sometimes the result of officers improperly activating their cameras.  In an email, LAPD Deputy Chief Robert Marino admitted that “there have been recent Categorical Use of Force Investigations where the involved officers had late activation.”  Officers were reminded of their obligations to record interactions with the public in a department-wide message, Marino said in the Sept. 15 email, a copy of which was obtained by The Times. He added that his office was working on a notice to supervisors about their “duties and responsibilities” to review officers’ reports and body camera videos.  Mark Smith, the commission’s inspector general, said last week that his office had been “closely monitoring” the LAPD’s investigation of the Mission gang unit from the beginning.  “Our monitoring is focused on ensuring that the investigation is impartial, unbiased, and thorough, and we will continue monitoring the investigation until it is complete,” Smith said in a statement. “Additionally, the [office] is currently in the planning phase of a review of all Department [gang enforcement details]. Our broad review of these units will be informed, in part, by the recent allegations involving the unit at Mission.”  The alleged misconduct in Mission came to light after a traffic stop in December: A motorist said that police had pulled him over and searched his vehicle without consent or probable cause. The motorist filed a complaint, and the ensuing internal investigation turned up other cases of Mission gang officers improperly switching off their cameras or otherwise failing to document stops.  As the department’s inquiry continued, allegations surfaced that some officers may have stolen items from people they pulled over.  The FBI is also investigating the unit for possible civil rights violations.  Times staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report."

The suspect, a 33-year-old, was transported to a hospital with critical injuries, but is expected to survive, according to the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, which is investigating the incident.  Advertisement  The victim, a 30-year-old woman, sustained minor injuries during the attack, was evaluated by paramedics but declined to go to the hospital, authorities said.  At about 6:35 p.m. Tuesday, Round Lake police officers were dispatched to a residence on North Park Road for an unknown problem. Upon arrival, officers spoke to a woman outside the home who said there was a woman in the basement who needed help.  Advertisement  The homeowner answered the door, and allowed the officers inside. The homeowner told officers that a man and a woman live in the downstairs basement of the residence. Round Lake officers attempted to speak to the downstairs residents through the basement door in attempt to figure out what was happening.  Meanwhile, an officer on the outside of the residence looked through the basement window and saw the man holding a knife to the woman’s throat, according to reports. Round Lake police officers attempted to de-escalate the situation, but the man refused to put the knife down or release the victim, officials said.  Due to the nature of the situation, the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS) and a regional SWAT team were called to the scene. Both the victim and the man are Spanish-speaking, so Spanish linguists were on-scene to lead communication efforts.  During negotiation efforts, the man grew “increasingly agitated” and refused to drop the knife or follow instructions, the release stated.  Two members of NIPAS discharged their firearms, hitting the suspect.  Members from NIPAS were able to rescue the victim from the man’s grip, the release said. Police officers provided aid to the suspect until paramedics arrived.  The two officers involved in the shooting were transported to area hospitals for evaluation, per protocol.  The initial woman police encountered outside of the home was an acquaintance of the victim, who the victim attempted to contact while being attacked, authorities said.  Advertisement  Evidence, including two knives, was collected from the scene. Charges against the man who took the victim hostage are pending, the release said."

The 37-year-old old man was booked into the Miami-Dade County jail on Friday on 53 total charges, including felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, resisting an officer with violence and possession of a short-barrel rifle, and 48 misdemeanor counts of discharging a weapon in public, according to court records. Officers responded to an apartment complex on July 7 where they found a man in body armor firing a gun into the air, according to a Miami police arrest report. Witnesses later told officers that the man claimed he was celebrating the new law that went into effect on July 1. An officer ordered the man to stop shooting and show his hands, but the man tried to run away, police said. The man turned his body toward the officer while trying to enter an apartment, and the officer opened fire, striking the man several times, police said.

Vallejo police releases report mandating return of Sean Monterrosa shooter,9/20/23,2023-09-27T01:42:43Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/vallejo-releases-report-mandating-return-of-monterrosa-shooter/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927014243id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/vallejo-releases-report-mandating-return-of-monterrosa-shooter/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927014243/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/vallejo-releases-report-mandating-return-of-monterrosa-shooter/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzA5LzIwL3ZhbGxlam8tcmVsZWFzZXMtcmVwb3J0LW1hbmRhdGluZy1yZXR1cm4tb2YtbW9udGVycm9zYS1zaG9vdGVy,"Leaders in the Vallejo Police Department, including a captain and the commander of the agency’s Professional Standards Division, stand by the actions of the officer who killed Sean Monterrosa. That’s according to testimony quoted in Arbitrator Alexander Cohn’s report, released Thursday by the city of Vallejo, which mandates Det. Jarrett Tonn’s return to the agency with back pay. Lt. Shane Bower testified that he found no flaw in Tonn’s decision to shoot Monterrosa, who was unarmed, in the early hours of June 2, 2020. Capt. Bob Knight similarly pushed back against many findings of an investigation that the city used to justify firing the detective. Knight called the 66-page report by the OIR Group a “catastrophically bad administrative investigation” that “fell short to me on a lot of levels.” And Bower, who is in charge of internal investigations at the VPD, “concluded that (Tonn’s) actions were in line with Department training and policy as it pertains to addressing a threat.” Cohn additionally quoted an email sent to the police force in which then-Chief Shawny Williams affirmed that Tonn “perceived a deadly threat” from Monterrosa and that he had “the most profound appreciation for (Tonn’s) hard work, dedication and courage.” The Napa-based arbitrator wrote, “This was an admission by the Department that Grievant reasonably perceived a deadly threat and did nothing wrong, despite having shot an unarmed man.” All in all, the arbitrator referred to the controversy between the city of Vallejo and the Vallejo Police Officers’ Association as “a close case in which even experts on use of force may reach different conclusions.” But pointing out that he is legally bound to consider only the facts available to Tonn when the shooting took place, Cohn concluded that the city erred when it terminated the police officer in October 2022. “Although not an easy question, the Arbitrator is constrained to view the situation from the SWAT officers’ points of view at the time,” Cohn wrote. “Using that lens, (Tonn) acted in self-defense of his fellow officers when he shot and killed Monterrosa, whom he believed was about to shoot them.” Conflicting testimony The Monterrosa shooting came at a time of intense civil unrest in Vallejo. George Floyd had been murdered by a Minneapolis police officer just days before. Vallejo police, according to the arbitrator’s report, saw themselves as “under siege” – facing crowds of protesters by day and bands of looters by night. Tonn and the two other SWAT Team members in his vehicle had been tasked with protecting the city’s businesses from thieves. They arrived at the Walgreens on Redwood Street and an officer informed them that he had been watching looters coming in and out of the pharmacy. The plan, the report states, was for the first officer’s police vehicle to approach the looters from one side and Tonn’s vehicle to approach from the other. Tonn’s team entered the parking lot and people coming out of the Walgreens started sprinting toward getaway vehicles. At this point, according to testimony from an officer whose name was redacted, news came over the radio: “The guy in the black, he’s armed.” What happened next is in dispute. There’s no clear video of the shooting itself. In violation of agency policy, none of the officers’ body cameras were activated at the time. Drone footage of the incident, according to public records, was later found overwritten with zeros. All three officers testified that immediately before Tonn shot Monterrosa, the 22-year-old had been in the process of getting into a black sedan that was driving away – but then, they said he suddenly spun around. One officer testified that Monterrosa dropped to one knee and held up a black object, looking like he was about to shoot. Another officer referred to Monterrosa falling into a “shooting position” with his hands near his waistband, where he was later found to be carrying a hammer. Tonn, according to the report, testified that Monterrosa grabbed the hammer “in the same manner one would grab a firearm, with his hand over the backside.” The detective, who was sitting in the back seat of his vehicle, gave no verbal warnings before firing an assault rifle five times through the vehicle’s windshield in a span of 1.5 seconds. He struck the unarmed San Francisco man once – in the back of the head. “What did he point at us?” Tonn can be heard asking in a belated bodycam recording. “I don’t know,” another officer replies. Cohn noted in his report that lying about an investigation can be a fireable offense and municipalities often charge officers with dishonesty when attempting to fire them. Vallejo did not charge any officers in the Monterrosa shooting with dishonesty, and therefore, “all sworn officers were considered truthful” in Cohn’s analysis. This incident was Tonn’s fourth officer-involved shooting. ‘A political decision’ When then-Chief Williams informed Capt. Knight that a consulting firm, rather than the police department, would be investigating the shooting, Knight’s “jaw just dropped.” “He told the Chief this was a bad idea because the OIR Group was not there that night and would not have the benefit of what was gleaned,” the arbitrator’s report states. Williams reportedly cut the captain off, saying, “It was a ‘political decision’ or ‘it’s political.’” The OIR Group’s report condemned several of Tonn’s decisions during and immediately before the shooting. It called the SWAT Team’s tactical approach to the looting at Walgreens “reckless.” It stated that because Monterrosa was shot in the back of the head, “he was turned away from detectives, dissipating any threat when he was fatally struck.” And it held up Tonn’s question, “What did he point at us?”, as evidence of him being unsure whether Monterrosa was, in fact, pointing a gun at officers. To the last point, Bower – who is the department’s rangemaster and leads the agency’s internal investigations – testified that officers coming out of a critical incident often act in unintuitive ways. Officers may be unable to formulate words or coherent sentences as they finish processing what just happened. Emotional states, meanwhile, run the gamut and include “negative or odd reactions.” Tonn testified that when he shot Monterrosa, he “100 percent believed (Monterrosa) was an imminent threat and about to shoot us.” Bower also testified that there is always a lag in even the fastest officers’ response times. This can sometimes result in people being shot in the back of the head as the officer responds to something that happened a split second before the person turned. Additionally, the lieutenant said he’d have made the same tactical decisions if he had received similar orders from the officer who was there before Tonn’s team arrived. Knight, for his part, said he “could not understand” Williams’ decision to fire Tonn and “analysis of use of force should rely upon facts and not opinion.” Cohn also heard from Williams, who resigned in November and, according to the report, “is currently retired.” Williams stood by the OIR Group’s findings. He said he fired Tonn because of policy violations including the fact that “deadly force was utilized when it was not objectively reasonable.” ‘Final and binding’ Cohn’s report underlined the “heightened sense of threat” that Tonn and other officers were experiencing just before the shooting – a fear driven by recent vandalism at the police station and “hostility in the community toward the Department.” Warnings about possible armed looters only added to that sense of danger. “He was primed to see a weapon when Monterossa (sic) acted as though he was able to deploy one,” Cohn wrote. “Because all three SWAT officers also saw Monterrosa either holding a gun or moving a hand toward his waistband area to pull one out, Grievant’s mistaken belief was one a reasonable officer at such a scene could make.” As further evidence, Cohn pointed out that the police department failed to fire Tonn for more than a year and a half after the Monterrosa shooting – instead treating him “as a sworn officer who was justified in using deadly force.” “These actions are another admission that Grievant could be trusted in the deadly use of force despite his actions on the night in question,” the arbitrator wrote. Cohn went on to criticize the police department for failing to convene a Critical Incident Review Board to consider Monterrosa’s case before firing him – a breach of protocol. He also questioned the city’s decision during arbitration proceedings not to call any OIR Group representatives to respond to witnesses’ concerns about the firm’s initial report. Cohn’s report describes itself as “final and binding.” The document also misspells “Monterrosa” as “Monterossa” 26 times. City Manager Mike Malone announced on Aug. 29 that the city will be reinstating Tonn per Cohn’s ruling. A crowd of about 120 people packed Vallejo City Hall last week in protest, blasting the decision across two hours of impassioned speeches. Among the protestors was Attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Monterrosa’s family in a civil lawsuit against the city. Merritt declined to immediately answer a question from Mayor Robert McConnell about how to prevent Tonn from returning to the force. “I certainly offer myself and my resources and an international group of people who work with cities across the country to come up with a reasonable answer to that question,” he said at the time. But he did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article. If Tonn returns to the VPD’s Patrol Division, Merritt has pledged to hire private security to track the detective’s movements and warn community members of his presence. The California Department of Justice is currently conducting a criminal investigation into the Monterrosa shooting. The agency’s press office said in late August that this review “is ongoing.” “We owe it to the family and community to ensure that cases involving the loss of human life are done right, and supported by a thorough, fair, and comprehensive investigation,” a spokesperson said. “Beyond that, we cannot comment on an active review.”"
Vallejo officer explains why he shot man who allegedly tried to kill him,9/20/23,2023-09-27T04:30:06Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/vallejo-officer-explains-why-he-shot-man-who-reportedly-tried-to-kill-him/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927043006id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/vallejo-officer-explains-why-he-shot-man-who-reportedly-tried-to-kill-him/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927043006/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/vallejo-officer-explains-why-he-shot-man-who-reportedly-tried-to-kill-him/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzA5LzIwL3ZhbGxlam8tb2ZmaWNlci1leHBsYWlucy13aHktaGUtc2hvdC1tYW4td2hvLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktdHJpZWQtdG8ta2lsbC1oaW0~,"The preliminary examination of a man accused of attempting to murder a Vallejo police officer began Tuesday. The hearing, which was scheduled to last for two days, is meant to determine whether enough evidence exists to take the case to trial. But many questions Tuesday focused more on the actions of Officer Brad Kim than on Jamazea Kittell, who allegedly tried to kill him. Under questioning from Public Defender Nick Filloy, Kim testified that he was outnumbered and in fear for his safety from the moment he arrived at a Springs Road gas station around 4:12 a.m. June 27. Kim said he shot Kittell in an attempt to stop the suspect from running him over and potentially killing him – but expressed uncertainty over how a bullet hole appeared in one of the rear doors of Kittell’s vehicle. Kim also testified that one of his own vehicle’s cameras failed to activate that morning because of a technical malfunction. Judge Robert Bowers frowned deeply and sustained several objections to Filloy’s flurry of questions. Kittell, who received stitches around his nostrils after the incident, watched the proceedings wearing a jail uniform and green beanie. Body camera footage uploaded by the Vallejo Police Department shows Kim arriving at the gas station in question and scrambling out of his squad car. The officer arrived alone and said he witnessed “at least three to four people” fleeing the business. “I was more focused on safety, on fears of some kind of retaliation or some type of action from the group to ensure that they got away,” Kim told the court. Spotting a Dodge Charger, which is faster than Kim’s own Ford Explorer, the officer said his initial plan was to park his vehicle bumper to bumper with the car to prevent anyone from driving off. But out of concern for the safety of suspects running in front of him, Kim said he screeched to a stop about six feet away from the Charger. Then, hoping to catch suspects but also worried about being “a sitting duck” who could be shot if he remained in his vehicle, Kim jumped out and drew his firearm. “The whole purpose of being a police officer isn’t to write a whole bunch of reports on your 10, 12 hour shifts,” the officer testified. “It’s so that you can catch bad guys doing bad things to good people.” Kim spotted a suspect later identified as Kittell getting into the Charger and he ran in front of the car. “As I was going around,” he testified, “I felt the vehicle lunge toward me.” Kim shot Kittell through the car’s windshield in the “split second” between Kim’s torso collapsing onto the hood of the vehicle and him falling onto the ground. “The only thing I thought of was, ‘I need to stop the driver from operating the vehicle,” he said. But photos of the Dodge Charger reveal two bullet holes: One in the windshield and another in the driver’s side passenger door. “As soon as I became aware that the car was no longer a great threat, I stopped firing,” Kim testified. Under questioning he later added, “The driver’s side rear door may have been mine. I’m not really sure.” The officer said one of the car’s rear windows was covered with a plastic bag, which could mean the vehicle had been in another shooting. Kim testified to two technical malfunctions the morning of the incident – one of which prevented him from broadcasting that there had been an officer-involved shooting, and the other of which stopped one of his vehicle’s cameras from working properly. He said he believed he’d broadcasted word of the shooting until the watch commander seemed surprised when he mentioned it later that morning. The problem with the camera, meanwhile, reportedly happened because Kim flipped a switch too quickly. “I guess they installed it in a way that didn’t work. I’m not really sure,” he said. Kittell’s preliminary examination will continue Oct. 3. This article has been updated to reflect the fact that the second day of Kittell’s preliminary examination was postponed to October."
San Jose police to classify gun-pointing as a use of force,9/20/23,2023-09-27T12:50:28Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/san-jose-police-set-to-classify-gun-pointing-as-a-use-of-force/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927125028id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/san-jose-police-set-to-classify-gun-pointing-as-a-use-of-force/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230927125028/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/20/san-jose-police-set-to-classify-gun-pointing-as-a-use-of-force/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzA5LzIwL3Nhbi1qb3NlLXBvbGljZS1zZXQtdG8tY2xhc3NpZnktZ3VuLXBvaW50aW5nLWFzLWEtdXNlLW9mLWZvcmNl,"SAN JOSE — The San Jose Police Department is expected to start recording cases in which officers point their guns at someone as a use of force, adopting a change that the city’s civilian police auditor has recommended for years.  In a memo to the City Council that was formally reviewed Tuesday, police Chief Anthony Mata wrote that SJPD expects to update its duty manual to include the change by the end of the month. In doing so, San Jose joins several other major US cities — including Oakland, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle, Denver, Washington, D.C. and New Orleans — in considering gun-pointing as a use of force.  According to Mata’s memo, officers have already been documenting when they point their firearms at people during enforcement stops and other encounters. But to this point, those cases have not been factored into the department’s tallies of use-of-force incidents, despite SJPD voicing its support for the change after the IPA’s office first made the recommendation in 2019.  Though state regulations already require police departments to track gun-pointing incidents, the new policy would amount to more than checking a new box on report forms. Documenting the act of pointing a gun as a use of force means an officer could be subject to more stringent evaluation to ensure it was performed in accordance with policy, which includes but is not limited to a review of body-camera footage and an internal-affairs investigation.  In its 2022 annual report, delivered to the City Council this week, the Office of the Independent Police Auditor cited research showing that requiring officers to report gun pointing as a use of force is “associated with systematically reducing the rate of officer-involved shooting fatalities.” The same research, the report states, shows that “implementing this policy has no effect on the rate of gun deaths of police officers,” contradicting law-enforcement concerns that officers could be endangered if the policy causes them to hesitate in dangerous situations.  “Community members have indicated that experiencing this kind of force can be traumatic and intense,” the IPA said. “The memory of the encounter can resonate for years. It is frightening and suggests the possible imminent use of deadly force.”  The change will almost certainly result in an increase, at least in the short term, of overall use-of-force incidents recorded by the department. When the IPA’s office first made its recommendation in 2019, it noted that in San Francisco, the policy change revealed that 41% of first-quarter-force reports that year involved officers pointing their guns at people.  Under the soon-to-be-adopted policy for San Jose, an officer merely drawing their gun would not constitute a documentable act, so long that the weapon stays at “low ready” position. The office defines that as being held at a 45-degree angle or less and not directly pointing at anyone.  The IPA’s 2022 annual report was originally scheduled to go before the council June 6 but was deferred to a later date. The postponement roughly coincided with an embarrassing episode in which former auditor Shivaun Nurre got into a loud public argument with police officers working at the San Jose Greek Festival, during which Nurre later admitted to being intoxicated.  Nurre notified the city of her intent to retire that same week. Retired Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney Karyn Sinunu-Towery, appointed to serve as interim auditor while the city conducts a search for a permanent successor, presented the annual report Tuesday.  The IPA report states that in 2022, the office received 358 police-conduct complaints from the public — the highest number in a decade — and that a third of the roughly 1,100 sworn officers in the department were named in at least one complaint.  Of those complaints, 18% had at least one sustained finding, meaning that misconduct was substantiated, which was at least a five-year high. At Tuesday’s council meeting, Assistant Chief Paul Joseph said 2022 “was a year of unprecedented levels of misconduct at the department, something that we’re ashamed of, and something that Chief Mata has taken a hard stand on.”  Mata also noted in his memo that the department is working to implement several other IPA-recommended reforms. They include more robust reporting when an officer perceives that someone is armed, confirms whether that person is armed, and the level of threat posed by the weapon.  The department also plans to update its duty manual to make clear that when officers conduct an intensive search of someone, that the officers have already committed to making a “full custodial arrest” — which in most instances means someone being taken to jail. This scenario is distinct from more passive pat-down searches during a detention that will end with a citation or release.  The policy change is based on Fourth Amendment protections to prevent officers from being noncommittal about someone’s arrest status, and then conducting an intensive search and using the results of that search to justify a subsequent arrest. However, Mata wrote in his memo that they believe there are several exceptions, including when people consent to a search, if someone is on probation or parole or when there is “reasonable suspicion that the detained person is armed and dangerous.”  The department also will adopt a reform recommendation to provide uniform guidance for when officers order someone out of their vehicle to sign a citation. Current policy defers to officers’ discretion based on their individual safety concerns, which has prompted questions about the equity — racial and otherwise — of the practice. That policy change is expected to be enacted in November.  The final reform stemming from the IPA report recommends equipping officers with devices that will provide a consistent benchmark for deciding if a vehicle’s window tinting violates state law requiring 70% of light to pass through the windshield and front side windows and thus warrant a potential traffic stop. The adoption of this recommendation is pending a cost evaluation."

The 37-year-old old man was booked into the Miami-Dade County jail on Friday on 53 total charges, including felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, resisting an officer with violence and possession of a short-barrel rifle, and 48 misdemeanor counts of discharging a weapon in public, according to court records. Officers responded to an apartment complex on July 7 where they found a man in body armor firing a gun into the air, according to a Miami police arrest report. Witnesses later told officers that the man claimed he was celebrating the new law that went into effect on July 1. An officer ordered the man to stop shooting and show his hands, but the man tried to run away, police said. The man turned his body toward the officer while trying to enter an apartment, and the officer opened fire, striking the man several times, police said. The man was taken to a local hospital, where he was being treated until his arrest. Republican Gov.

The man killed - Nathan K. Wood, 28, of Bleeker - attacked a property owner and the officer, troopers said.  Around 7:57 a.m., State Police out of Fonda responded to assist the Johnstown Police Department with the officer-involved shooting, state police spokesperson Trooper Stephanie O’Neil said in a news release.  O’Neil said Wood went into an upstairs apartment without permission in a building on Washington Street in Johnstown. The resident of the upstairs apartment was not home at the time, she said.  The property owner, who lives in a downstairs apartment, told Wood to leave, O’Neil said. Wood hit the owner multiple times with a hammer, causing serious injuries, she said.  When a Johnstown police officer arrived, the officer confronted Wood, O’Neil said. Wood did not follow the officer’s commands and hit the officer with a hammer. The officer then shot Wood, she said.  Wood was taken to Nathan Littauer Hospital in Gloversville, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.  The officer and property owner were taken to the same hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, O’Neil said.  The state Attorney General’s Office is investigating the incident along with the State Police, O’Neil said.  Staff writer Darian Stevenson covers breaking news, crime and public safety.

Trial to begin for 3 Tacoma officers in death of Black detainee Manuel Ellis,9/18/23,2023-09-23T13:07:08Z,en,latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-18/trial-begin-tacoma-officers-death-manuel-ellis,https://web.archive.org/web/20230923130708id_/https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-18/trial-begin-tacoma-officers-death-manuel-ellis,https://web.archive.org/web/20230923130708/https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-18/trial-begin-tacoma-officers-death-manuel-ellis,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGxhdGltZXMpL3dvcmxkLW5hdGlvbi9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTA5LTE4L3RyaWFsLWJlZ2luLXRhY29tYS1vZmZpY2Vycy1kZWF0aC1tYW51ZWwtZWxsaXM~,"Tacoma, Wash., police Officers Christopher Burbank, left, Matthew Collins and Timothy Rankine, who have been charged in the death of Manuel Ellis.  Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in the trial of three Tacoma, Wash., police officers charged in the death of Manuel “Manny” Ellis, a 33-year-old Black man who was tackled, punched, shocked with a stun gun and held face down on a sidewalk in March 2020, two months before George Floyd met a similar fate.  Officers Christopher Burbank and Matthew Collins, who are white, have been charged with second-degree murder, and Timothy Rankine, who is Asian American, faces first-degree manslaughter charges. They have pleaded not guilty.  Opening statements are expected to start Oct. 2 in Pierce County Superior Court in Tacoma. The trial is expected to run four days each week until December.  Advertisement  Ellis purchased a box of doughnuts and some water at a convenience store about 11:21 p.m. on March 3, 2020, and walked across the street, where he encountered Burbank and Collins sitting in a patrol car, according to a probable cause statement filed by the Washington attorney general’s office.  Burbank and Collins said Ellis tried to get into a stranger’s car and then attacked the officers when they confronted him. But witnesses say the officers jumped out of their car as Ellis walked by and knocked him to the ground. Several witnesses recorded the encounter with their cellphones as they screamed for the officers to stop, the document said.  A video taken by a woman sitting in a car behind the officers shows Burbank wrapping his arms around Ellis, lifting him into the air and slamming him onto the pavement, striking him with his fist in the process, the statement said.  “Collins then moves in towards Ellis and brings his weight down onto him,” the document said. “With Ellis underneath him, Collins begins striking Ellis’s head with his fist. Meanwhile, Burbank draws his Taser gun and walks close in towards Ellis. Collins can be seen on [the witness’] video striking Ellis’s head four times, with Ellis screaming after each strike.”  Collins wrapped his arm around Ellis’ neck while squeezing, and his head fell limply to the sidewalk. The officer also pressed on Ellis’ back while pushing his face into the ground, the document said.  Advertisement  A doorbell security camera across the street picked up Ellis saying, “Can’t breathe, sir. Can’t breathe,” and one of the officers responded by saying, “Shut the [expletive] up, man.”  The officers then wrapped a hobble restraint device around Ellis’ legs and linked it to his handcuffs behind his back in a “hog-tie” position while he remained in the prone position. They also pulled a spit-hood over his head. After the hobble was applied, he stopped moving, the statement said.  All three witnesses said Ellis was not fighting back during the struggle, the prosecutor said.  Ellis was pronounced dead at the scene.  The Pierce County Medical Examiner said the cause of death was “hypoxia,” a lack of oxygen, “due to physical restraint,” and found the manner of death was homicide.  Lawyers for the officers filed reports saying that Ellis was resisting and trying to get away and that the officers needed to use force to get him into custody.

Experts hired by the officers blamed his death on methamphetamine use and heart problems, calling it an accident.  The Pierce County Sheriff’s Office initially investigated the death, but months later, when it was revealed that sheriff’s personnel were involved in the detention, Gov. Jay Inslee ordered the Washington State Patrol to take over the investigation and referred the charging decision to the Washington attorney general’s office.  Charges were filed May 27, 2021, marking the first time the attorney general’s office has charged a law enforcement officer with murder. It was only the second time an officer has been charged with murder in Washington state since voters approved Initiative 940 in 2018, which removed the requirement that prosecutors show an officer acted with malice in order to be charged with murder.  Auburn Officer Jeffrey Nelson was charged in 2020 with second-degree murder and first-degree assault in the shooting death of Jesse Sarey on May 31, 2019. His trial is pending.  Ellis’ family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers, and the Pierce County Council approved a $4-million settlement agreement in 2022. The deal ended the county’s involvement, but Ellis’ sister, Monet Carter-Mixon, and mother, Marcia Carter, continue to pursue their wrongful death lawsuit against the city of Tacoma."
Alameda County DA promised to hold police accountable.

She quickly announced that her office would review six fatal police shootings and two in-custody deaths to determine whether any of the officers involved should face criminal charges. So far, however, the DA’s Office has not publicly announced any charging decisions in any of the police shooting cases, which had previously been reviewed and cleared by former longtime District Attorney Nancy O’Malley, who retired at the end of her term last year. Price said the goals she originally set for these cases were ambitious — and the process of re-examining them has taken longer than she would have liked. “Our goal is to be far more timely than the office — my predecessor’s administration — was,” Price said in a recent interview. “So we started off with our own internal goal of trying to move forward as much as we could within 120 days. That was the internal benchmark that I set. We’re beyond that in most of the cases because they require more investigation.” The fatal police shooting cases under review range from as far back as 2007 to as recent as 2022. They include the controversial killings of Mack “Jody” Woodfox in 2008 and Andrew Moppin-Buckskin in 2007 by Oakland police officer Hector Jimenez. Also under review is the 2022 killing of San Jose resident Cody Chavez by Pleasanton police officers Brian Jewell and Mario Guillermo. In the Pleasanton case, the officers fatally shot Chavez after he emerged from an apartment building carrying a kitchen knife. Officers said he lunged toward them. A report by O’Malley’s office found insufficient evidence to charge the officers, saying they justifiably believed Chavez posed a lethal threat. A wrongful-death lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Chavez’s family. Price said the city’s police chief asked why her office was revisiting the case, and she explained the circumstances of the standoff and subsequent shooting raised concerns. “My predecessor’s handling of it raised red flags,” Price said. “Certainly as a resident of Alameda County, anytime police officers are deployed and the manner in which they were deployed in that incident raises red flags. We don’t want tanks and BearCats in the streets of any neighborhood. These are not terrorist threats. And it does concern me — the impact on public safety — when there’s such a display of force as was demonstrated in that case.” Price said she has “more than a suspicion” that officers may have violated criminal law in the cases her office has reopened for review. Still, the DA suggested she would issue declination memos — statements describing the office’s decisions — in the cases where criminal charges are not pursued. “Under those eight cases where my predecessor had closed them, the decision to review them was not made lightly,” she said. “We understood first and foremost that we were at risk of retraumatizing the victims who had lost loved ones. That it would trigger them.” On the other side, she needed to weigh “subjecting the officers to what they would certainly believe is unfair and undue scrutiny because they had been led to believe that they had been cleared,” she said. “And so it was certainly not very comfortable for them to feel like maybe they weren’t in the clear.” Price’s reopening of police shooting cases mirrors similar actions taken by progressive district attorneys across the country following widespread demonstrations protesting police brutality and racism. And they are facing many of the same challenges, said Philip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who is considered a national authority in collecting data on prosecutions of police officers. Police in the United States fatally shoot more than 1,000 people per year on average, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. From 2005 through the beginning of August 2023, Stinson found there have been 184 nonfederal sworn law enforcement officers who have been arrested on suspicion of murder or manslaughter stemming from an on-duty shooting throughout the United States. But there are multiple reasons why more officers don’t face criminal charges in on-duty shootings, and why more aren’t convicted, Stinson said. One is that grand juries want to see prosecutors meet a high bar of probable cause before returning an indictment, or “true bill,” against an officer. Similarly, trial juries are reluctant to second-guess the split-second decisions officers make in a violent or potentially violent encounter, he said. Prosecutors also are reluctant to bring cases where they don’t think they will win, or where winning a conviction may be difficult. Another reason is that investigators who probe fatal police shootings often start with the assumption that the killing was legally justified, affecting the quality of evidence gathered in the course of an investigation, Stinson said. “They don’t necessarily canvass the neighborhood and talk to witnesses the same way they would normally do, so they don’t often preserve evidence in the same way,” said Stinson, a former police officer. “There’s just all kinds of gaps in the file, and that leads to problems with the prosecutors’ offices. So reopening these old cases is really a difficult task, because they tend to run into pushback from the local law enforcement agencies on what they’re asking for, when in fact what they’re asking for is nothing that they wouldn’t normally see if this were not a police-involved shooting.” Price’s office filed charges in May against two Alameda County sheriff’s deputies, Sheri Baughman and Amanda Bracamontes, in one of the in-custody death cases that was under review. The deputies are accused of falsifying records in connection with the death of 32-year-old Vinetta Martin at the Santa Rita Jail. Martin used a bedsheet to hang herself in April 2021, three weeks after telling jail employees she planned to die by suicide, prosecutors said. The deputies doctored logbooks to make it appear they were following procedure when video evidence showed they “repeatedly failed to check on Ms. Martin for extended periods,” according to prosecutors. Baughman and Bracamontes have pleaded not guilty. While police officers and family members of the dead wait for Price’s office to come to decisions in their cases, at least one family says they are hopeful justice will be done. “I want to thank the DA for reopening the case,” said Anthony Chavez, Cody Chavez’s brother. “Because the second worst day of my life in the past two years was when I got the information that the DA who retired declared the murder of my brother a ‘good shoot.'” Staff writer Jason Green contributed to this report."

Santos, of Kauai, was wanted since Sept. 8, after the fatal shooting of Kith Silva-Lacro, 28, of Kalaheo a day earlier on Kahili Mountain Road. In addition to Kauai police, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were assisting in the search. At about 10:20 p.m. Sunday, law enforcement officers located Santos operating a motor vehicle near Kekaha Beach Park and a quarter mile west of the Akialoa Road and Kaumualii Highway Junction, the Kauai Police Department said in a news release. “Unfortunately, despite several efforts to encourage Mr. Santos to peacefully surrender to police, his actions during contact with law enforcement officers resulted in an officer-involved shooting,” said KPD Chief of Police Todd Raybuck in a statement. No officers were injured and Santos was transported to Wilcox Hospital, where he currently remains, the release said. No information was provided on his condition or the extent of his injuries. Kaumualii Highway at mile marker 27 is closed in both directions due to the ongoing investigation, police said."
Bail reform sees a smooth rollout in Cook County,9/18/23,2023-09-22T16:01:36Z,en,suntimes.com,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/18/23879782/bail-reform-first-test-cook-county-smooth-rollout,https://web.archive.org/web/20230922160136id_/https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/18/23879782/bail-reform-first-test-cook-county-smooth-rollout,https://web.archive.org/web/20230922160136/https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/18/23879782/bail-reform-first-test-cook-county-smooth-rollout,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN1bnRpbWVzLGNoaWNhZ28pLzIwMjMvOS8xOC8yMzg3OTc4Mi9iYWlsLXJlZm9ybS1maXJzdC10ZXN0LWNvb2stY291bnR5LXNtb290aC1yb2xsb3V0,"Bail reform sees a smooth rollout in Cook County Despite a frenzied Monday morning of last-minute preparations, the hearings at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse were not substantially different from the old cash bail system. A courthouse worker raised her hands in celebration late Monday afternoon as Cook County finished its first day under Illinoisâ historic law eliminating cash bail. âWeâre done. One day down,â she said, beaming. Then she quickly added, âJust all the rest of them to go.â After a flurry of last-minute preparations, the hearings at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse were not substantially different from the ones under the old cash bail system. Judges no longer ordered people to pay a bond to be released from jail, a system critics decried as inherently unfair and damaging to communities. Instead, judges were now faced with whether to simply detain someone until trial based on whether they were determined be a threat to the public or at risk of not returning to court. Cook County is expected to be closely watched as the reforms are tested with real world cases, and the courtrooms were filled Monday with judges and lawyers observing the new proceedings unfold for the first time â at times chiming in to offer advice when difficult procedural questions arose. âI appreciate everyoneâs patience, weâre working out a lot of new processes,â said Judge Mary Marubio, who heads the courtâs pretrial division. She was working with a group of assistant public defenders to determine how an order placing someone on electronic monitoring on a new charge would be impacted by a separate case the person was facing. Behind the scenes, courthouse personnel who could previously sleepwalk through initial hearings were operating in a slightly frenzied state, asking last-minute procedural questions of each other as they guided paperwork and defendants to their proper destinations. Separate courtrooms were established to handle the initial flood of cases: one to set conditions for release and the other for hearings where prosecutors were seeking to detain someone. Prosecutors filed petitions to detain eight people on Monday: four were granted, three were denied and one couldnât be heard because the person, shot by police a day earlier, was still hospitalized. Judge Marubio repeatedly warned defendants who would go home after their court appearance that violating the terms of their release â not appearing in court or picking up a new charge â could result in them spending the rest of their case in jail. âI want you to understand that consequence,â she told one defendant sternly. Many of those appearing in support of relatives facing charges said they hadnât heard much about the bail reform. In one case, Judge Charles Beach reviewed a bond that had been previously set for a man facing a charge of driving on a suspended license. He ordered the man released on the condition that he be in contact with the Pretrial Services Department. His family said they were able to hire a private attorney after learning that his charge was not eligible for detention and he could be released without having to post the $2,000 bond. âIt was a big help,â a relative who attended the hearing said. But in another case, a man facing a residential burglary charge but with no other criminal history was accused of violating his electronic monitoring. Prosecutors asked for him to be detained, saying they believed he couldnât be trusted to follow the courtâs orders and may not return to court. An assistant public defender for the man said his client left his home in order to visit a relative on a day his aunt died after a long illness. âThat is an extraordinary circumstance that could affect anyoneâs thinking,â the assistant public defender argued, adding that the situation was âunlikely to repeatâ and the man was supposed to start a new job next month as a flagger for a construction company. But Judge Beach noted that when sheriffâs deputies approached the man, prosecutors said he ran away and blocked the door of an apartment with a refrigerator. âBased on those factors I am going to detain you,â Beach told him. Not everyone was satisfied with the new system â though whether the outcome would have been substantially different under the old system was difficult to tell. A woman who said she was robbed by three other women last weekend said she was worried about her safety after a judge ordered all three released on Monday. Prosecutors had only sought for one of the alleged attackers to be detained, but the judge determined electronic monitoring would be sufficient. âIf the judge was robbed and severely beaten, would she had let them go? Would another fellow judge had let them go?â she said outside the courtroom. âNo they would have not.â There were also moments of levity, cutting through the stress of a day of brand new rules and concerns about how closely they were being watched. âThat doesnât really exist anymore,â Judge Beach said to chuckles when an attorney asked for a client to be released on a bond.

A week ago, police body camera audio came out in which the vice president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild says the quiet part very loud, laughing and joking with the guild president in the aftermath of the death of a 23-year-old student killed by another officer who was racing to a 911 call. Northeastern University student Jaahnavi Kandula was walking in a Seattle crosswalk in January when Officer Kevin Dave — driving 74 mph in a 25 mph zone — hit her, throwing her more than 100 feet. Kandula was from India and was studying information systems. Officer Daniel Auderer, vice president of SPOG, accidentally left his body camera running when he was talking with union President Mike Solan after assessing whether Dave was under the influence. In recording audio, he minimizes Dave’s responsibility, erroneously saying “he’s going 50, that’s not out of control for a trained driver.” But it was Auderer’s other comments that shocked people around the world. In the recording, Auderer laughs with Solan and says, “just write a check” to make up for the loss of Kandula’s life. He then says, “Eleven thousand dollars. She was 26 anyway. She had limited value.” (In truth, she was 23 and her life had limitless value.) SPOG tried to limit and preempt the damage from the recording, releasing a Friday post on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying Auderer’s comments were intended to mock what lawyers would say, and did not reflect his feelings. But even if you take the most generous reading of the comments at face value, this defense strains credulity. In response to the audio, the Seattle Office of Police Accountability launched an investigation and within days, the audio was picked up by media around the world. Not long after, #JusticeForJaahnavi began appearing on X, and the consulate general of India in San Francisco called the handling of the case “deeply troubling.” Elected officials from all levels of government levied their outrage. Petitions were created and hundreds of people rallied last Thursday in Seattle to demand accountability for Kandula’s death. It was bitterly ironic the recording emerged less than a week after a U.S. district judge ruled the Seattle Police Department had achieved “full, sustained and lasting compliance” with most of the requirements of a federal consent decree intended to improve biased policing and police accountability. Notably, the judge will continue oversight of police crowd control and officer accountability. In March, Mayor Bruce Harrell and U.S. Assistant Attorney Kristen Clarke called SPD a “transformed organization,” in asking Judge James Robart to find the department fulfilled the agreement’s core requirements. Yet the comments on the recording sound more like the department of old, not the supposedly transformed version of today. What was most chilling to me about the recording was the laughter. SPOG might try to spin the officer’s words as a misunderstanding, but the laughter shortly following the death of this precious young woman spoke volumes. The laughter said her life didn’t have value to the officers. The laughter betrayed a belief that they could do or say whatever they wanted and there would be no consequences. As Annalesa Thomas, whose son, Leonard Thomas, was killed by Lakewood police in 2013, said in a statement from the Washington Coalition for Police Accountability, “When we hear a recording of police officers joking about Jaahnavi Kandula’s death, we can’t help but imagine all of the unrecorded conversations of police officers belittling our dead loved ones.” The coalition is calling for support of Washington state House Bill 1445, which was proposed in the 2023 session to empower the state attorney general to investigate and hold police accountable. Many are calling for the firing of officers Dave, Auderer and Solan and I understand that impulse. But I think it’s even more important to look at the culture of the department and ask how much it really has changed at its core. It’s not about bad apples, it’s about a culture that is confident of its impunity. A culture that after 11 years of a federal consent decree, leaves the heads of the police union feeling no hesitation in laughing or minimizing a human being’s tragic death. This culture hurts people of color most, particularly Black and Native American people who experience a disproportionate use of force by police and Black and Asian people, who are more likely to be victims of police shootings. But the world is pushing back on that impunity. At the rally last Thursday, participants held signs calling for justice for Jaahnavi. I noticed one girl holding a sign reading, “I have unlimited value. So did Jaahnavi.” I couldn’t agree more."

Sadness and caution in wake of deputy’s shooting of 2 teens: What do we need to talk about?,9/16/23,2023-09-20T02:16:18Z,en,syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2023/09/sadness-and-caution-in-wake-of-deputys-shooting-of-2-teens-what-do-we-need-to-talk-about.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230920021618id_/https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2023/09/sadness-and-caution-in-wake-of-deputys-shooting-of-2-teens-what-do-we-need-to-talk-about.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230920021618/https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2023/09/sadness-and-caution-in-wake-of-deputys-shooting-of-2-teens-what-do-we-need-to-talk-about.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN5cmFjdXNlKS9jcmltZS8yMDIzLzA5L3NhZG5lc3MtYW5kLWNhdXRpb24taW4td2FrZS1vZi1kZXB1dHlzLXNob290aW5nLW9mLTItdGVlbnMtd2hhdC1kby13ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXRhbGstYWJvdXQuaHRtbA~~,"Syracuse, N.Y. -- Deka Dancil stands in front of the Onondaga County sheriff’s office, a bullhorn in her hand.  “These were two young, Black boys who didn’t have to die,” she says.  The gathering of 20 begins to chant: “No Peace. No Justice.”  Then they say the names, Dhal Apet, 17, and Lueth Mo, 15.  The unarmed teens were shot and killed Sept. 6 by Onondaga County sheriff’s deputy John Rosello when they were in a stolen car investigated in connection with late-night burglaries.  The boys were Black, American sons of South Sudanese refugees. Rosello is white, from a department that is more than 90% white.  Throughout the Syracuse area, people are figuring out what this tragedy means.  There have been two small protests and a march. At one of them, an organizer remarked at how small the turnout was. Elected officials have largely been silent.  The response seems muted when compared to the 2020 marches for justice and George Floyd. It was the beginning of “Black Lives Matter” in a community where the statistics seem to tell the opposite story. The city has among the nation’s highest rates of concentrated poverty among Black residents, and is still working to undo the segregation created by redlining and the construction of I-81.  Many U.S. communities across the nation have grappled with racially charged police killings. Last month, Ohio police officers shot and killed a pregnant Black woman accused of shoplifting. In that case and the Syracuse shooting, police said the car was coming at the officer, whose choice was to fire or get run over.  Now those conversations and introspections have come to Syracuse.  New York Attorney General Tish James will decide whether Rosello’s actions were justified. A video of the incident raises enough questions on both sides that experts have said it’s not clear cut. Sheriff Toby Shelley and Rosello’s union have defended him. There’s been a wave of “back the blue” on social media.  Community figures who spoke with Syracuse.com said there is more than one more problem to untangle, more than one person to blame.  Due process is gone  Rickey Brown, a Black parent of two young men who works as a diversity consultant, said every time there is a police shooting of an unarmed Black man, the narrative is the same.  “The officer was afraid for his life,” Brown said. “It was either him or the person on the other end of the gun.”  But in watching the video captured by a home security camera, Brown said he saw scared teenagers trying to flee, not hit the deputy. Brown questions why the deputy didn’t wait for backup. Why didn’t the deputy turn on his body-worn camera or his dashboard camera?  Brown said he realizes the teens were in a stolen car. Perhaps they should have been arrested, he said, but not killed.  “The officer is being afforded due process,” Brown said. “That’s something that was taken away from the children.”  Brown said the response of Sheriff Toby Shelley made the situation worse. Before the video was released to the public, he defended Rosello’s actions, saying he had no place to go to escape the oncoming car. For days, that version was unchallenged.  “The video did not coincide with what we heard from the sheriff,” Brown said. “Either he purposefully mischaracterized, or we’re in a place where we can be force-fed this information and take it again and again.”  Some people have leveled blame at the parents of the teens. Brown said he doesn’t think that’s fair.  “I completely empathize with the parents. It’s challenging,” he said.  Kids make mistakes, he said, “in spite of all the things you have given them. All the things you have done to build their character.”  Where to put the blame  Community activist Mary Nelson, who is Black and raising four teens in the city schools, said she sees the shooting of the teens in two parts: the deputy and the parents.  “A child’s life is gone,” Nelson said. “That hurts me more than anything.”  She has so many questions that she worries will not be answered. Why did the deputy have to shoot? It seems he could have gotten away.  The mother and grandmother questioned whether the teens would have been shot if they were white, pointing to what happened to the white 18-year-old who shot and killed 10 Black people in a Buffalo grocery. Police cuffed him and put him in the police car. No officer fired a shot at him, Nelson pointed out.  “People are mad about the police. I’m even more so about the parents; your child should have been in the house,” said Nelson, whose youth center runs after school until 6 p.m.  Everyone needs to work together better to make sure kids are being given opportunities that keep them out of trouble, and that they are being held accountable, she said.  ‘I will not criminalize the kids’  Protestors gather on State St. in front of the Justice Center to voice their concerns over the shooting deaths of Lueth Mo, 15, and Dhal Apet, 17 Wednesday Sept 6th . Dennis Nett | dnett@syracuse.com  The teens would have attended Henninger High School this year in the Syracuse school district.  Superintendent Anthony Davis said the school community has been working to support the students’ friends and family. The day after the shooting, teachers stopped by Mo’s house to comfort the family.  Like the other shootings his district has dealt with, this one had ripples that went beyond Mo and Apet.  “The hard part is the trauma reaches past just those people involved. That spider web goes way out,” Davis said.  Davis is Black. He has raised Black sons, and now runs a school district where the nearly 50% of the students are Black and more than 20% are Latino.  “I don’t know police protocol,” he said. “I’m just very disappointed with the results, that two kids were killed.”  He said he’s still trying to understand everything that happened.  “I will not criminalize the kids,” Davis said.  There has been a lot of talk about teen crime in the city. Deputies have been investigating a string of car thefts and burglaries by groups of teens who seem to be competing with each other. A different group of young people stole a Lexus by driving it through the glass showroom at Driver’s Village this summer. Mo and Dhal were in a stolen Hyundai that was connected to two burglaries that the deputy was investigating when he shot the teens, the sheriff said.  The shootings tax the frayed trust many in the Black community have with the police. Davis said the officers who work within the schools have built relationships with students. This is a thing they will likely talk about with each other. Because of that, he thinks that trust will remain.  But he is less certain about what happens to the trust between the larger community and the police.  “It’s different,” Davis said. “In the (school) buildings, I think we’ll be OK. Outside the buildings, I’m not sure.”  As he spoke, about 50 teens – some members of the Mo and Apet families – marched toward the sheriff’s office, carrying pictures of the dead boys. They were calling for Rosello, the deputy who shot the two teens, to be charged with a crime for the shooting.  ‘Weighted consequences’  “We need to do some changing,” the Rev. H. Bernard Alex said.  Alex is a pastor at Victory Temple Fellowship Church and the president of the Syracuse chapter of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization founded by Rev. Al Sharpton.  This is not something another roundtable or think-tank suggestion can fix, he said.  He sees part of it simply: There should be a policy that if an officer doesn’t turn on his body-worn camera for an incident like this, he should be fired immediately.  Shelley’s predecessor, former Sheriff Eugene Conway, resisted getting body-worn cameras for the department. They finally bought the cameras a little more than a year ago, but it’s unclear how often the cameras are used. Under Conway’s leadership the office bought, then returned, a device that would have turned on the deputy’s body-worn camera and dashboard camera as soon as he drew his gun.  “There have to be weighted consequences to assure a community who is tired of this,” said Alex, who is on the town of DeWitt’s police commission. “This is across the country. People are tired of police against community, community against police.”  Alex, though, emphasized that the community should not meet this violence with more violence. “We don’t need that,” he said.  Alex said that the pain goes beyond the slain teens’ families. Rosello has to live forever with having killed two people.  Dancil, who is a field organizer for the New York Civil Liberties Union and a community activist in Syracuse, said she had to force herself to watch the video of the shooting.  She is Black, and the mother of two boys. One is an infant and one is 7.  Mo and Apet were just boys, too, she said.  She said the officer was violent from the moment he drove up on the scene, ramming the car the teens were in. “If the police hit me with their car, I’m not thinking they want to talk,” Dancil said at a rally earlier this week. “I’m feeling that my safety is in danger.”  Dancil said the NYCLU is asking for a full review of the incident, including why the officer did not turn on his cameras. She stopped short of saying that he should be fired. That decision is for the attorney general to make, she said.  But it is hard for her to watch the video and not think of her own boys, growing up.  “If they make a mistake, I don’t want them to die,” Dancil said.

Approval of the city’s settlement agreement with Russell Strong is on the Denver City Council’s agenda Monday. Strong filed his suit in February 2021, alleging that Denver police officers used “extreme violence” against peaceful protesters on May 30, 2020, in the early days of the racial justice demonstrations sparked across the country by the Minneapolis police murder of George Floyd.  An officer later identified as Adam Bolton fired a “kinetic impact projectile” at Strong’s head, hitting him in the eye, according to the lawsuit. Despite emergency surgery, Strong lost his right eye on June 4, 2020.  In an interview with The Denver Post in 2021, Strong said losing his eye had a “devastating” impact, including making everyday tasks such as driving more difficult. He also said that after the incident, he struggled with the mental strain of being in crowds with visible damage to his eye.  In a statement on Friday, attorney Qusair Mohamedbhai, whose firm represented Strong in the suit, praised his client’s courage in seeking to hold Denver police accountable for their actions during the protests.  “As he tries to move forward with his life after losing an eye, he is faced with the daunting task of adjusting to a permanent and life-altering injury,” Mohamedbhai said. “We are proud of Russell’s efforts to ensure that others in the future will not suffer the same harm.”  The City Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the settlement.  The pending settlement will increase the city’s legal payouts for the weeks of clashes between law enforcement and largely peaceful protesters in 2020 to nearly $10 million, according to city legal records.  That number still could grow significantly. The city is working to appeal a $14 million jury award last year to a dozen protesters for civil rights violations in a case that includes now-state Rep. Elisabeth Epps of Denver as a plaintiff.  Last week, the council approved settlements for six other protesters stemming from police conduct during the 2020 demonstrations, including former mayoral candidate Terrance Roberts. Those six payments added up to $1.1 million.  Stay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot."

The $20 million redevelopment comes from the nonprofit Refuge and Restoration, headed by pastors Beverly and Ken Jenkins. Tenants include Employ St. Louis, North County Innovation Center, Assisted Recovery Centers of America, Brilliant Angels Academy, Cathy’s Kitchen and Midwest BankCentre.  The 88,000-square-foot plaza, at 10148 West Florissant Avenue, had stood vacant since Schnucks closed in 2006.  “We see this plaza all the time. It’s always been in the back of our minds,” Beverly Jenkins told the Post-Dispatch Wednesday. “This is our community. It’s important to us.”  The idea for the complex has been in the works for a decade, she said. The Jenkinses had always envisioned the marketplace as a community hub of economic resources and opportunities, and they created their five pillars — education, workforce, small business development, banking and a community resource center — to guide the project.  Dellwood, just east of Ferguson, gained national attention in 2014 after a Ferguson police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, prompting peaceful protests during the days followed by nights of rioting in the area. That experience was transformative for the small community, R&R Marketplace supporters said at a grand opening Thursday.  “All of us are here today as a result of what happened in August 2014, also associated with the loss of Michael Brown’s life,” Bill Carson, vice president and senior business development officer at U.S. Bankcorp, told a crowd of more than 100 supporters Thursday morning.  “All of us, every single person here, took refuge in one another and that refuge inspired restoration in this community,” Carson said.  To fund the project, Ken Jenkins said they tapped into every development resource in the St. Louis area they could. Thirteen million dollars in New Markets Tax Credits were allocated from Heartland Regional Investment Fund. Midwest BankCentre also financed over $5 million in loans for the redevelopment. Donations and grants have helped, too.  Jahhara Bentley said she didn’t know the strip mall was being restored until she dropped her mom off for the ribbon cutting Thursday. Her mom works at Cathy’s Kitchen.  “I love that they’re putting something in the neighborhood to bring it up,” Bentley said. “The Employ St. Louis, I think that’s a really good idea to have in this area right here. I feel employment places are kind of far, so for it to be right here is kind of convenient for the community that really needs the jobs.”  Ken Jenkins said the Refuge and Restoration nonprofit is the parent organization of Employ St. Louis, North County Innovation Center and Brilliant Angels Academy. The other tenants were developed through relationships and inquiries, he said.  “We wanted to make sure tenants understood our vision,” Ken Jenkins said. “It was important for us to have the right people.”  Tenant and financier Midwest BankCentre is opening its new Innovation Centre there (not to be confused with the North County Innovation Center.) In addition to testing new products, services and technology to serve individual bank customers, the branch will make smaller-dollar, non-traditional loans to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  “The small business development that is happening is the backbone of America,” Orvin Kimbrough, CEO of Midwest BankCentre, told the Post-Dispatch Wednesday. “The Innovation Centre has focused on people who want to establish that economic development.”  Next door, the North County Innovation Center is outfitted with new offices, a commercial kitchen, small conference rooms. It will offer trainings and networking opportunities to help people launch and grow businesses.  “This was a groundbreaking community development project. I am thrilled to witness the launch of this exciting and innovative project that aims to enhance the City of Dellwood,” Dellwood mayor Reggie Jones said. “This is a historical development.”  A second phase is planned to begin next year and would include the Refuge and Restoration non-denominational church, arts and theater programming, video and media production and a demonstration commercial kitchen. A library, computer lab and cafe are also planned."
Vallejo settles with alleged police ‘badge-bending’ whistleblower,9/15/23,2023-09-17T06:48:48Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/15/vallejo-settles-with-alleged-badge-bending-whistleblower/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230917064848id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/15/vallejo-settles-with-alleged-badge-bending-whistleblower/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230917064848/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/15/vallejo-settles-with-alleged-badge-bending-whistleblower/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzA5LzE1L3ZhbGxlam8tc2V0dGxlcy13aXRoLWFsbGVnZWQtYmFkZ2UtYmVuZGluZy13aGlzdGxlYmxvd2Vy,"Vallejo has reached a $900,000 settlement agreement with a former police captain who claims he was fired for exposing the Vallejo Police Department’s “badge-bending” scandal.  The Vallejo City Council approved the agreement – confirmed by ex-Capt. John Whitney and his attorney, Jayme Walker, on Thursday – during a closed session Tuesday afternoon.  RELATED: Union says badge bending occurred at Vallejo Police Department, but for a different reason  Whitney had served on the Vallejo police force for 19 years when the city fired him in August 2019. He claims the police department targeted him for exposing a tradition of bending back the star points on the badges of officers who killed someone in the line of duty.  “I took an oath to uphold the public trust and that’s what I did when I blew the whistle on badge bending,” Whitney said in a statement. “I shouldn’t have lost my career for trying to hold officers accountable. Vallejo took so much from me, but now I have finally been vindicated.”  Walker condemned what she sees as the city’s attempts to cover up a now-infamous practice.  “John Whitney tried to reform a department with much higher rates of police shootings than almost any other agency in California,” she said. “Badge bending should have been rooted out immediately. Instead, Vallejo tried to cover it up and fired the officer trying to stop it. Hopefully beginning with this settlement, the City of Vallejo will start making necessary reforms in its police department and holding its officers accountable for excessive use of force.”  The city did not admit fault in the settlement and did not respond to requests for comment on this article.  Whitney’s lawsuit, which he filed in 2020, targeted the city, the police department, then-city manager Greg Nyhoff, and former Vallejo Police Chiefs Andrew Bidou and Joseph Allio.  Earlier in 2020, Nyhoff told people gathered at a town hall to discuss police matters that it “appears true” that officers were bending their badges to celebrate kills and he pledged that there would be discipline. A third-party investigation of the practice was launched by then Vallejo Police Chief Shawny Williams in late July of 2020.  Whitney claimed that when he brought up the misconduct, then-chief Bidou rounded up the badges in an attempt to send them for repairs but realized that if finance saw a bill for 10 badge repairs they might start asking questions.

Soon after, Open Vallejo reported that Whitney was terminated for removing personal data from his work cellphone while he was being investigated for improperly handling information. He was later cleared of these allegations.  Mayor Bob Sampayan wrote a letter attached to the ex-captain’s initial claim filed in March 2020.  “Frankly, I believe that because John spoke out about a negative culture in the Vallejo Police Department, his reputation was soiled by those who did not want ‘dirty laundry’ aired,” he wrote.

This week, after eight hours of hearings, Tamaulipas State Judge Patricio Lugo Jaramillo ruled against 12 Tamaulipas state police officers linked to the January 22, 2022 massacre near Camargo. The officers also face additional charges and remain behind bars awaiting sentencing on September 19.  As Breitbart Texas initially reported, on January 22, 2022, the police officers shot and killed a group of migrants that were being smuggled from Monterrey to the U.S. border, where they would be smuggled into Texas.  The execution occurred in the Las Piedras Ranch in the municipality of Diaz Ordaz, near the border between the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. At the time, the police officers reportedly confused the vehicles used by the human smugglers for a convoy of cartel gunmen and shot at them. Upon realizing the group was made up of migrants and not cartel gunmen, authorities set fire to the bodies and vehicles to erase the evidence.  For the charges of murder, abuse of authority, and crimes against public administration, Judge Lugo Jaramillo ruled against former special operations commander Horacio Rocha Nambo and officers Hector Javier Alfaro Acuña, Horacio Quiroz Sánchez, William Figueroa Medellin, Jorge Echeverria Barcenas, Christian Eduardo González Garcìa, Carlos Rodriguez Rodriguez, Jorge Castillo Miranda, Jose Luis López Morales, and Edgar Manuel Antonio.  In the case of regional police coordinator Mayra Elizabeth Vazquez, Judge Lugo Jaramillo was convicted here on the same three charges but also added a fourth charge of lying in official statements for her attempts to cover up the case.  For officer Ismael Vazquez Leon, who reportedly turned state’s witness, the judge only convicted him of abuse of authority and crimes against public administration. This spared him from the more severe murder charge.  Vazquez Leon and two other witnesses who lived in the area where the crime took place were key in providing authorities with testimony about what happened and the subsequent cover-up, sources with the Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office revealed.

‘Ban killer kops’: Protesters swamp Vallejo City Hall over the reinstatement of officer involved in fatal shooting,9/14/23,2023-09-15T03:56:10Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/14/tonn-protest-vallejo-city-hall/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230915035610id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/14/tonn-protest-vallejo-city-hall/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230915035610/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/14/tonn-protest-vallejo-city-hall/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzA5LzE0L3Rvbm4tcHJvdGVzdC12YWxsZWpvLWNpdHktaGFsbA~~,"Outrage over the impending reinstatement of the Vallejo police officer who killed Sean Monterrosa swept through council chambers Tuesday, with protesters blasting the city’s decision across two hours of fiery speeches. Signs reading “ban killer kops” waved in the crowd of over 120 people as the Vallejo City Council repeatedly extended the original 15-minute time block allotted for public comments at the start of the meeting. Dozens of reform advocates – including several family members of people killed in Vallejo police shootings – took the podium to condemn the return of Det. Jarrett Tonn, who shot Monterrosa while he was on his knees with his hands up in June 2020. “We used to raise hell up here because we really thought that y’all could really do something,” David Harrison – a cousin of Willie McCoy, who Vallejo police killed in 2019 – told council members. “But I’m seeing now that there’s nothing that you can do, because the police officers – you guys are scared of police officers. You’re scared.” In response to a question from a public speaker, all council members raised their hands to indicate they would personally support blocking Tonn’s reinstatement. But, according to Mayor Robert McConnell as well as City Manager Mike Malone, they can’t. “The last ruling was by an independent arbitrator who said, ‘you must rehire,’” McConnell said amid shouted jeers. He added, “We’ve got to find a proper way to do what we want to do.” The city fired Tonn over the Monterrosa shooting in October 2022. Tonn appealed that move, however, arguing that he mistook a hammer in Monterrosa’s waistband for a gun and didn’t realize the 22-year-old was facing away from him. Last month, an arbitrator ordered Tonn returned to his post with back pay. Malone said in a statement that the detective will be back “as soon as practicable,” but was unable to provide specific timelines at the time. It’s unclear whether Tonn will ever return to the Vallejo Police Department’s Patrol Division. If he does, civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who is representing the Monterrosa family in a lawsuit against the city, has pledged to hire a private security company to monitor the officer’s movements and warn community members of his presence. ‘Blood money’ Antoinette Saddler’s brother, — Angel Ramos — died after Vallejo police officer Zach Jacobsen shot him while he was fighting another man in 2017. The city of Vallejo paid out $2.8 million in November 2022 in a settlement over the 21-year-old’s death. Saddler’s family lives in a new house now. Her mother doesn’t have to work every day. But Saddler said Tuesday that no amount of money could undo the pain and loss Jacobsen inflicted on her and the people she loves. “I don’t care if we move into a big new mansion. That (expletive) does not bring my brother back,” Saddler declared. “I don’t care how much money is in the world. That is blood money.” The speaker demanded greater accountability within the Vallejo Police Department for the 33 people its officers have killed since 2000. She excoriated the city for taking almost three years to implement just eight of 45 recommendations to improve its law enforcement – progress so slow, the California Department of Justice is currently drafting legal documents to force Vallejo into faster reform. “Y’all put one or two things in place out of the 40-plus y’all (were) supposed to do!” Saddler shouted. “Y’all know what I had to put in place? My brother’s headstone. My brother’s coffin.” Council members Tuesday offered few direct answers to community members’ comments, which were theoretically limited to three minutes and later two minutes in length but which regularly blew past the designated time limit. A rare response from McConnell came after much of the audience stood and applauded a speech in which Merritt proclaimed, “On behalf of the Monterrosa family and the community standing with them, it’s clear we don’t consent to the return of Jarrett Tonn to the street.” “You’re a constitutional scholar,” the mayor said. “You’re an attorney, as am I. Do you have any recommendations as to how we deal with the adverse arbitrator’s decision?” “I appreciate that you’re asking the question,” Merritt responded. He declined to answer in a “30-second sound bite,” but said, “I certainly offer myself and my resources and an international group of people who work with cities across the country to come up with a reasonable answer to that question.” Mixed demands Other speakers hurled a variety of complaints and demands at council members, ranging from calls for better engagement with the community to disbanding the Vallejo Police Department and rebuilding the city’s law enforcement from the ground up. Philip Balbuena, the civilian representative on VPD’s critical incident review board, pointed out that few council members have attended recent town halls concerning the police department – the most recent of which attracted a crowd of about 100 people Aug. 24. He referenced a scheduled Thursday meeting about a proposed plan to have Vallejo police stop responding to automatically triggered alarm calls. “You can stand there and not speak,” Balbuena said, “but come Thursday, all hell is going to break loose for (Interim Police Chief Jason) Ta and (Deputy Chief Joseph) Gomez – but you aren’t going to be there. And you are the ones negotiating with the (Vallejo Police Officers’ Association)! The least that you can do is stand by your associates, the ones that you have left behind.” Balbuena warned that poor police morale can contribute to exhaustion, impatience and, ultimately, poor decisions. He also sharply criticized an item originally on the meeting’s agenda to discuss a potential 3% cost-of-living pay raise for City Manager Malone. “Something needs to be done,” Balbuena said. “People need to feel safe on the streets, and we need to prioritize. We’re not going to prioritize you or anybody else’s raise until people start feeling safe again.” McConnell announced at the start of the meeting that council members were striking Malone’s potential raise from the agenda. Other speakers called on the city to immediately release a report investigating VPD’s badge-bending scandal – in which some officers would bend the tips of their badges after killing a person. In a Monday press release, Malone stated that the city cannot release this report because police personnel records are protected under California law. Three judges have sided with the city in rulings on the case, but yet another legal challenge is currently in progress. Other attendees voiced more radical critiques. Lively whoops burst from the crowd as speaker Tiny Garcia declared Vallejo to be “occupied Miwok and Ohlone territory.” “It doesn’t matter what settler colonial town we talk about, because the same settler colonial government is in place, killing our sons and daughters,” Garcia said. “And so the bigger question that we have for you, that I hope you can answer, is, ‘When will you stop killing our people?’” Speaker Juju Angeles spent over one minute leading audience members in a sacred song intended to “open up all your hearts to really bring some change.” And a speaker who identified herself only as Marie C. referenced successful efforts in Camden, N.J. to both dramatically transform the city’s approach to policing and substantially reduce crime rates. “Abolish VPD,” Marie said. “Start it over again, because the culture is so toxic in Vallejo. It’s a state of emergency, the police department is so bad. Y’all are bankrupt because they keep killing people.” The other four and a half hours Councilmember Mina Loera-Diaz was the only official to offer a response immediately after the extensive public comments. She defied protesters to do better than her. “When people say that you will be remembered, I hope so,” Loera-Diaz said, referencing earlier comments on the current council’s legacy. “Because I have done every damn thing that I had to do, and if people don’t like that, then that’s on them. Run! Run for office! Get up here and do what you can do. I’ll be sitting in the front row when you guys are up here.” McConnell declared a recess, after which the council proceeded with the rest of their slated agenda items. The meeting lasted until 1:38 a.m. A handful of speakers spoke on other agenda items, which included updates on plans to rebuild the Vallejo police station as well as Ta’s most recent attempts to find more officers to patrol the city. See Friday’s edition of the Vallejo Times-Herald for more information on these topics. Three virtual speakers resurrected earlier discussions about police during the second public comment section near the end of the meeting. By the evening’s close, the in-person audience consisted of a single member of the public and two members of the media."
Colorado State Patrol training officers to reinforce duty to stop others using excessive force,9/14/23,2023-09-15T03:15:59Z,en,denverpost.com,https://www.denverpost.com/2023/09/14/colorado-state-patrol-intervention-training-excessive-force/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230915031559id_/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/09/14/colorado-state-patrol-intervention-training-excessive-force/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230915031559/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/09/14/colorado-state-patrol-intervention-training-excessive-force/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGRlbnZlcnBvc3QpLzIwMjMvMDkvMTQvY29sb3JhZG8tc3RhdGUtcGF0cm9sLWludGVydmVudGlvbi10cmFpbmluZy1leGNlc3NpdmUtZm9yY2U~,"The Colorado State Patrol announced a partnership with the Georgetown University Law Center for Innovations in Community Safety to implement a new program training officers on techniques for preventing misconduct and avoiding police mistakes. The Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement, or ABLE, program includes scenario-based role-play and the creation of a culture that supports intervention in high-stress situations, regardless of officer rank, according to a state patrol news release on Tuesday. This program is in compliance with Senate Bill 20-217, which went into effect July 1. The bill made it illegal for a Colorado police officer to fail to stop another from using excessive force and protects those who attempt to intervene from any retaliation. “ABLE was not considered due to any incident,” Master Trooper Gary Cutler said via email Wednesday. Cutler said the decision to implement ABLE training was made in 2021. But he noted that as part of the $19 million settlement in the 2022 killing of Christian Glass by law enforcement, the state agreed to share with every trooper a video of Glass’ parents explaining the importance of further intervention training. The agreement also required CSP to incorporate lessons from the killing into its training; policing experts have said that officers at the scene — including Clear Creek County sheriff’s deputies, Idaho Springs and Georgetown police officers, a Colorado State Patrol trooper and state Division of Gaming investigators — failed to de-escalate the situation before deciding to use deadly force on Glass, who was unarmed and posed no threat. According to Cutler, CSP will adhere to ABLE’s program standards after the training is complete. These standards include “meaningful training,” “accountability” and “community support.” Training began May 23 and, according to Cutler, 100% of sworn-in members are expected to be trained by the end of December. As of Tuesday, more than 90% of troopers already had gone through the program. “We are very excited to be partnering with ABLE to expand our training on active bystandership,” CSP chief Col. Matthew C. Packard said in the news release. “Through this program we prioritize our commitment, dedicating an internal resource to coordinating this program and adhering to outside standards.” The ABLE Project is meant to build on training to help police officers stop unnecessary harmful behavior of other officers. According to the news release, all sworn CSP staff, including top leadership, will be required to take the ABLE training and will receive annual refresher training from this point forward.

Updated 5:30 p.m. Sept. 14, 2023: This article was updated to include that all CSP troopers will be shown a video of the parents of the late Christian Glass explaining why such intervention is important and to note that the settlement involving Glass’ death at the hands of law enforcement officers included a mandate that CSP incorporate lessons from the police shooting into its training."

The deadly encounter occurred about 8 p.m. Wednesday on the south side of Algona, a city of about 5,300 residents roughly 35 miles south of Iowa's border with Minnesota, according to the Iowa State Patrol. Iowa Department of Public Safety (DPS) officials say Algona police officer Kevin Cram was shot while trying to arrest Kyle L. Ricke, 43, of Algona, over an active warrant for harassment in Palo Alto County. Cram, 33, was taken to Kossuth Regional Health Center in Algona, where he was pronounced dead. According to the charging document, Ricke yelled immediately after he shot Cram with a handgun, ""too late [expletive]. â¦ I'm tired of all this [expletive]."" Ricke was captured without incident roughly 110 miles from the shooting scene four hours later near Sleepy Eye, Minn., at a family member's residence. He was booked into the Brown County jail around 4:10 a.m. Thursday. Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, said Ricke is charged with first-degree murder and will be extradited to Kossuth County. Cram's death marks the sixth law enforcement officer in or near Minnesota who has been fatally shot in the past five months. Iowa DPS Commissioner Stephan Bayens called Cram a hero who ""chose to be a beacon of light."" ""Kevin ... was an outstanding police officer here at the Algona Police Department and in many ways was the bedrock of this department,"" Bayens said. Bayens called Ricke a coward and said Cram's death wouldn't deter Algona and Iowa police from doing their jobs. Cram was a 10-year police veteran who worked in Algona for eight years. He started his career in North Springs, Iowa. DPS officials ask the public to respect the privacy of Cram's family and Algona police. Few details are known about the shooting, including whether there were any witnesses. No one else was injured during the incident. The Iowa Department of Public Safety issued a ""Blue Alert"" after Cram was shot, meaning a member of law enforcement has been assaulted or is missing. The Minnesota State Patrol had pilots in the air assisting in the pursuit, said Lt. Gordon Shank, the patrol's chief spokesman. On July 14 in Fargo, Officer Jake Wallin, 23, was killed and two fellow officers and a civilian were wounded by gunfire from Mohamad Barakat, of Fargo. A fourth officer shot and killed Barakat. On May 6 in western Wisconsin, St. Croix County Sheriff's Deputy Kaitie Leising, 29, was shot just outside of Glenwood. Leising was answering a call about a drunken driver stuck in a ditch. The suspect, Jeremiah D. Johnson, of Shakopee, was found dead nearby with a gun close to his body. On April 15 in western Minnesota, Pope County Sheriff's Deputy Joshua Owen was killed on his 44th birthday while responding to a domestic dispute call April 15. Two other officers were wounded. The suspected shooter, Bryan Nygard, of Cyrus, Minn., died when officers returned fire.

And not just any novel, but one that skewered the supposedly englightened book business through the eyes of a young Black woman stuck in a low-level assistant job at a prestigious, overwhelmingly white publishing house. To make it possible, Harris and the boyfriend she’d been dating for less than a year began living together in a studio apartment in Midwood, a far-flung Brooklyn neighborhood. Over the course of a frantic summer, in between shifts at a cupcake shop and a creative writing workshop for kids, she finished a draft. “It’s insane. I don’t know who that person was,” recalled Harris, over the din of sweet sweepers on a sweltering early September morning in Park Slope. “I was very desperate, and so tired of publishing.” The desperation didn’t last long: Her debut novel, “The Other Black Girl,” a creepily satirical, zeitgeist-capturing thriller aptly described as “The Devil Wears Prada” meets “Get Out,” sparked a 14-way bidding war, sold to Atria for a reported sum of more than $1 million, became a bestseller, and received ecstatic reviews when it was published in 2021. (The L.A. Times called it a “perceptive exploration of racism in publishing, wrapped up in a whip-smart story of young women at war in the workplace.”) Naturally, Hollywood also came calling: before Harris had even handed in final edits on the manuscript, an adaptation was in the works at Hulu. On Wednesday, “The Other Black Girl” — a 10-episode series developed by Harris and Rashida Jones and produced by the Onyx Collective, Disney’s diverse storytelling division — premiered on the streaming service. “I’m in a very small, privileged group of writers who’s not only gotten something adapted within like, three years — which is crazy — but also, I was part of it. It’s on a whole other level.” The series stars Sinclair Daniel as Nella Rogers, who has toiled away for two years as an assistant at Wagner Books, a Manhattan publishing house, where she is surrounded by white colleagues — circumstances that Nella, raised in the Connecticut ‘burbs, knows all too well. Already frustrated by her lack of career momentum, Nella is further demoralized when she raises concerns about a grossly stereotypical Black character in an upcoming book by one of Wagner’s bestselling (white, male) authors, only to be silenced by her high-strung boss, Vera (Bellamy Young). Nella is also haunted by the mysterious fate of Kendra Rae Phillips, the first Black female editor at Wagner in the 1980s, who collaborated with another Black woman, Diana Gordon (Garcelle Beauvais) to create Nella’s favorite book, “Burning Heart” — then seemed to vanish without a trace. So Nella is understandably ecstatic when she learns that another Black woman, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), has been hired at Wagner — even if Hazel, with her Howard degree, Harlem roots and seemingly “authentic” Blackness, stirs both admiration and inadequacy in her. The women bond over their shared experiences (and mutual love of “Burning Heart”) but Nella quickly grows wary of her seemingly perfect new colleague. Her concerns multiply when she receives a note telling her, “Leave Wagner now.” “I’m really proud of it,” said Harris, sitting outside a cafe where the baristas greet her with a familiar wave. “I think readers will really be excited about the changes we made — and the changes we didn’t make.” Still, the editor in her head can’t help but be nervous. “I know I’m oftentimes more vocal about shows I don’t like than I am about books. So I’m just bracing myself for that.” No doubt some of Harris’ anxiety stems from her deep connection to the series’ protagonist. Like Nella, Harris grew up in Connecticut and had literary aspirations from a young age. Storytelling was in her DNA: her father, Frank Harris III, is a journalism professor and former columnist at the Hartford Courant. Her sister is writer and critic Aisha Harris, who hosts an NPR podcast and provoked the rage of Megyn Kelly with a piece questioning why Santa Claus was assumed to be a white man. Harris fondly recalls how her father would always be grading a stack of papers or jotting down ideas on paper and how, as a family, “we’d come up with stories on our way to karate class and piano lessons.” In an early experiment in self-publishing, Harris would write and illustrate books using stacks of printer paper. (She still has one of them, called “Aren’t You Tired Yet?”) After studying English literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she applied to a fiction writing program at the New School in New York. She was wait-listed, but was admitted to the nonfiction program. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise: she took a class with the poet and activist Hettie Jones, who liked her writing, urged her to consider a publishing career and helped make some introductions. By the fall of 2016, not long after she completed her graduate studies, Harris started as an editorial assistant at Knopf Doubleday, long known for its literary fiction. “I was happy because I had insurance. I had great roommates. I was living the young professional life,” she said. But the bubble quickly burst. “And then I was like, “OK, publishing is a lot.’ I loved the idea of getting to be an editor and acquiring my own titles. But at the time, it didn’t feel like you could move up and have your own kind of agency for a very long time.” She wrote book reviews on the side, did some ghost-writing, and chipped away at another ambitious novel that remains unfinished. Then one day in the office bathroom, she ran into a Black woman she’d never seen before. Harris was thrilled — but also immediately wondered who the woman was and why she suddenly seemed to materialize from nowhere. The encounter, though fleeting, lingered in her mind. “I was just thinking about, ‘Why was I so excited?’ And then the what-ifs. Like, what if she’s a robot? Then I got the idea for this book, and just ran with it.” She started writing what would become “The Other Black Girl” in longhand, on Knopf stationery — something that helps her be less critical, she said — during quiet moments at her cubicle. (In the book, Nella is alerted to Hazel’s presence by the sudden smell of cocoa butter wafting in the air.) Within a few months, she quit her job. Working at a creative writing program for children that summer also helped fuel her. “Being around kids who are just starting out brought me back to what writing was like pre-capitalism for me, where it’s just the pure thrill of it,” she said. She was revising the book and thinking about the adaptation in 2020 as George Floyd’s murder sparked protests across the world and racial reckonings in countless powerful institutions and industries — including, yes, the book business. While the book “already had the message of the commodification of Blackness and performative wokeness,” she said, the cultural climate only gave her more fodder. “2020 wasn’t the first year, obviously, we’ve had police shootings or people just going rogue against Black people. But I do feel like 2020 really made me home in on this part of my manuscript where Nella is really reflecting on her existence in this space. Even the moments where Nella is sitting at her desk, thinking about instances of police brutality and how hard it is to have to turn off that knowledge of what’s going on in the world when you go to the office.” In addition to co-writing the pilot, Harris was part of the writers room, made up predominantly of people of color (as was the directing team). “I remember very much at the beginning, talking with the room about what we all wanted to see in the series and also our own personal experiences in the workplace with bosses who are annoying, but also with another Black person who wasn’t looking out for us.” The writers often probed deep into Nella’s psychology, and, to Harris, it sometimes felt intensely personal — “like a therapy session for this character that isn’t totally me,” she said. “But, very much like her, I have anxieties about not being Black enough, about not being as cool as Hazel. Those are all versions of like fears that I had as a younger person.” She eventually sat down with Danielle Henderson, who was then the showrunner, to explain why she felt blocked and needed to change her relationship to the character: “’I’m cutting the cord. I’m giving birth to this thing. And I’m passing it on,’” she said. “I am still very close to the book. But I had to very quickly divide myself from the character of Nella.” Still, there were other surreal moments — as when Harris visited the show’s Atlanta set and saw meticulously realized versions of the Wagner Books office and the cramped Brooklyn studio Nella shares with her boyfriend. “We’re playing with an idea that I came up with in my studio apartment. And now there’s a costume team devoted to outfits for these characters, who are now real people,” she said. Harris cites an eclectic array of influences on the series, from “Night of the Living Dead,” “The Stepford Wives,” “Key & Peele” (especially the sketch about an a capella group that already has a Black guy), “Rosemary’s Baby,” and the novel “Passing” by Nella Larsen. Most of the changes to the series are minor. We see more of Nella’s life outside the office, including her boyfriend Owen (Hunter Parrish) and best friend, Malaika (Brittany Adebumola). And a pivotal plot point involving a surprisingly powerful form of hair grease is introduced earlier in the story. Perhaps the biggest change involves the ending. While the book version of “The Other Black Girl” ends on what can only be called a down note (“I am a morbid realist,” Harris said of the divisive conclusion), the Season 1 finale is more ambiguous, leaving the door open to interpretation — and a possible Season 2. “That’s the hope,” said Harris, who is currently at work on a second novel and hopes to do more screenwriting once the writers’ strike is over. “I’ve definitely imagined a world beyond the end of the book.” ©2023 Los Angeles Times.

Video of deputy shooting teens leaves experts uncertain: ‘What was his purpose for firing?’,9/13/23,2023-09-14T04:27:58Z,en,syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/09/video-of-deputy-shooting-teens-leaves-experts-uncertain-what-was-his-purpose-for-firing.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230914042758id_/https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/09/video-of-deputy-shooting-teens-leaves-experts-uncertain-what-was-his-purpose-for-firing.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230914042758/https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/09/video-of-deputy-shooting-teens-leaves-experts-uncertain-what-was-his-purpose-for-firing.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN5cmFjdXNlKS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDkvdmlkZW8tb2YtZGVwdXR5LXNob290aW5nLXRlZW5zLWxlYXZlcy1leHBlcnRzLXVuY2VydGFpbi13aGF0LXdhcy1oaXMtcHVycG9zZS1mb3ItZmlyaW5nLmh0bWw~,"Syracuse, N.Y. – Newly released video of an Onondaga County sheriff’s deputy shooting and killing two teens raises troubling questions that won’t be fully answered without further investigation, several law enforcement experts said.  Experts contacted by Syracuse.com said they had concerns about the deputy’s actions. He fired at a moving vehicle, a move that is widely discouraged by police agencies. And he clearly was able to get out of the path of the fleeing car as he was shooting at it.  At the same time, key seconds in the video – which has no audio – are hidden from the camera’s lens. That makes it hard to know, for now, the answer to the central question: Was the shooting justified as a matter of self-defense?  The video fails to make clear exactly when the shots were fired or at what angle they struck. Those details will help establish whether the shooting came before or after the deputy stepped out of the path of the car.  “That’s the biggest question right now,” said Frederick Cornelius, a Cayuga County private investigator who worked in law enforcement for 26 years.  The video, from a home surveillance system roughly 200 feet away, shows sheriff’s Deputy John Rosello standing in a DeWitt parking lot and firing his gun at a car as it moves toward and then past him.  Rosello is obscured from view at a key moment in the video, when the suspects’ car backs up, turns toward Rosello and then takes off. Then Rosello can be seen leveling his gun at the car, but it’s not clear when he fires three shots.  Did Rosello yell commands at the occupants of the car? When did he fire the first shot? Did he continue firing after he stepped out of the car’s path?  One thing is clear, the experts said: Rosello was able to avoid getting hit by the car.  “It’s obvious he could step out of the way because he does,” said Brian Higgins, former Bergen County, N.J. police chief. “There’s no fancy diving and rolling. Whether or not it was legally justified, what was his purpose for firing? Common sense would say do what he did — step out of the way.”  Two teen passengers in the car were killed: Dhal Apet, 17, and Lueth Mo, 15. A third occupant, the driver, escaped and later ditched the stolen car with Dhal and Lueth still in it, police said.  None of the five experts we spoke to was able to make a firm judgment based on the video. Critical evidence remains to be uncovered.  The incident occurred just after 6 a.m. Sept. 6. Rosello, who had been investigating a burglary, responded to a call about suspicious activity at a DeWitt trailer park involving two vehicles that matched the description of stolen cars used in the burglary.  The video shows Rosello’s car driving into the parking lot fast and tapping the bumper of a white Hyundai sedan, pinning it against the shrubs behind it. A second vehicle flees across the grass and gets away. Rosello gets out of his car and approaches the Hyundai.  For about two seconds, Rosello disappears from view behind his police cruiser. The Hyundai backs up and turns toward Rosello. Then the deputy can be seen backing up and stepping to the side, leveling his gun at the car as it drives off.  Higgins, now an adjunct professor for the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said he had concerns about the deputy’s actions, but added that the video did not provide enough information to say whether the deputy acted appropriately or not.  Did the deputy feel his life was in danger? When? Critical seconds of the action are blocked from view.  Some of those questions might have been answered if Rosello had activated the body-worn camera he wore, Higgins said. But he didn’t.  Chuck Wexler, longtime head of the Police Executive Research Forum, said he has long endorsed a policy of police never shooting at moving vehicles without some other threat present besides the vehicle. That’s because incapacitating the driver doesn’t stop a vehicle; it only leads it to continue out of control.  But Wexler said that the video of last week’s shooting leaves many questions unanswered. The most important part of the encounter happens in the seconds that the deputy is hidden from view behind his patrol vehicle.  Wexler said it remains an open question whether the shooting was justified.  “You cannot exactly see what happened, and that will be up to investigators to determine what happened,” he said.  Cornelius, the Cayuga County investigator, agreed that the video does not provide definitive proof of whether the shooting was justified or not.  “It looks from the video that he had a means of escape, that he could’ve gotten away,” Cornelius said. If that were true, that could mean Rosello was not justified in shooting the two teens, who were on the passenger side of the car.  But Cornelius said the angle of the video is not great.  Much of the case, he said, will hinge on where Rosello’s bullets hit the car. Rosello fired three shots. Are the bullet holes in the front, as the car is coming at him? Are they in the side, indicating that the car was not coming at him when he shot?  That forensic evidence will be critical, he said.  Cornelius, who has investigated police shootings before, said he often thinks if someone has enough time to draw their gun, they have enough time to get away in a case like this. But there’s so much unknown about what happened, and there was a clear risk that Rosello was trying to protect himself against, based on the way the call was described.  “He knows he’s dealing with felony crimes when he arrives,” Cornelius said. “He doesn’t know if they’re armed.”  From 200 feet away, the camera provides a different view of the scene than Rosello had up close. Investigators will have to balance what they see on the video with interviews and physical evidence from the scene.  “Whether the driver intended to hit the officer is really secondary to what the officer reasonably perceived,’’ said Tom Aveni, executive director of the Police Policy Studies Council. “If the officer reasonably perceived that this guy was accelerating toward him, that’s all that really matters.”  Aveni, who served 26 years as a cop before becoming a consultant and trainer, said the lack of sound and the distant perspective of the video make it difficult to interpret.  The video also does not answer the question of why Rosello answered the call alone, without backup. Were other deputies or other police departments available?  Higgins said he’s not sure why the deputy began the encounter by crashing into the suspect vehicle. While the vehicle matched the description of one used in two overnight burglaries, that might not have been enough for such a forceful approach, Higgins said.  “Part of that situation he’s involved in is self-created,” Higgins said. “The individuals (in the car) could claim fear. Some cop comes driving into us.”  While raising critical questions about the deputy’s response, Higgins also noted that the driver of the suspect vehicle didn’t help matters.  “If you see the police and just complied, you’d see fewer of these,” the former police chief said. “The deputy had a split-second decision and now we’re Monday morning quarterbacking him.”  Still, the outcome is undeniably tragic, Higgins said.  “At the end of the day, regardless of the outcome of the investigation, you have two dead people who were not actively involved in trying to harm this officer,” Higgins said. “He shoots the two people who don’t have control over the operation of the vehicle. Was this worth it for the crime they were alleged to have committed?”  Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said the state Attorney General’s office still has much to investigate beyond what’s in the video.  Fitzpatrick said information from the autopsy report, which has not yet been completed, will help shed light. Investigators also will look at the angle the bullets entered the car and how the two teens were seated in the car when they were shot.  He encouraged the public to be patient.  “The case is being investigated by competent people. The truth and facts will eventually be known,” Fitzpatrick said.

The museum will hold a ceremonial groundbreaking on Oct. 5 for a sizable new expansion that will increase its footprint by a third. Transgender Catholics: Catholics and members of the LGBTQ+ community are at odds over the new policy implemented by the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland that lists rules for churches and schools across Northeast Ohio for people who âexperience gender dysphoria and/or gender confusion.â Molly Walsh reports on the reaction to the two-page list of rules, which affects all staff, volunteers and students at diocese parishes and schools. Walsh also reports that some residents fear the policy will increase the risk of suicide and self-harm among young people who identify as LGBTQ. Editor Chris Quinn compiles reader responses from his Subtext account. Redistricting: Thereâs an emerging rivalry on the Ohio Redistricting Commission between the two Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker Jason Stephens and Senate President Matt Huffman, who is expected to run for the House next year and then challenge Stephens for his leadership position. Andrew Tobias reports the dynamic could create incentives for Stephens, who won his leadership job with help from Democrats, to shape how involved Democrats may be in lawmaking. CLE crime: Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday rolled into Cleveland for the second time in recent weeks and praised the success of the law-enforcement partnerships that have worked to reduce crime in the city. Olivia Mitchell reports the support has resulted in 138 felony arrests and 63 seized firearms. Some of the guns were traced to at least 23 other crimes.

Statehouse and Politics Tax breaks: Ohioans who are 70 or older, make up to $70,000 per year and have owned their home for at least 10 years would have their property taxes frozen under new bipartisan legislation in the Ohio House, reports Jeremy Pelzer. The sponsors of the â70 under 70â³ bill, which would come on top of the stateâs homestead exemption and other tax breaks for older Ohioans, would freeze both property tax rates for those Ohioans and require that local governments tax their property at the same assessed value, even if their homeâs assessed value goes up.

Sabrina Eaton reports theÂ blockchain industry is lobbying for regulations, including a campaign to stress the technologyâs importance to Ohioans. Social Security: The amount of savings allowed for Americans who receive Social Security Income has not been updated since 1984 and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown says the limits keep people with disabilities from being financially independent. Sabrina Eaton reports groups including AARP, JPMorgan Chase, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Catholic Charities are endorsing bipartisan legislation introduced by Brown that would raise limits to $10,000 for individuals and $20,000 for couples. Northeast Ohio News Affordable housing: Cuyahoga County could soon set aside $26.4 million to build affordable housing and help low-income residents cover rent and utilities, reports Lucas Daprile. Three separate programs were to be introduced Tuesday during a meeting of Cuyahoga County Council. Jail food: Cuyahoga County Council could extend a contract to its troubled jail food provider, but officials say the new agreement would have more oversight. In the past, the food has been so bad corrections officers have worried it could spark a riot, Lucas Daprile reports. Hinckley Lake: Hinckley Lake will start disappearing next week so that construction on an improved dam can begin later this year. Peter Krouse reports the lake, which is part of Metroparksâ Hinckley Reservation, will close Monday and wonât reopen until 2026, which means the swimmers, anglers and boaters that enjoy the recreation area on a regular basis will have to find somewhere else to spend their spare time. Cultural Garden: Walking into the Greek Cultural Garden is designed to feel like walking back when democracy was born and philosophy was paramount in ancient Greece, reports Zachary Smith in his Cultural Gardens series. The garden was dedicated in 1940, just before World War II, but the Greek population began arriving in Cleveland long before then. New fruit to try: Susan Brownstein discovered a delicious new fruit you can grow in your Northeast Ohio garden: ground cherries. They go by several nicknames: cape gooseberries, husk tomatoes and poha berry. She likes sweet tomatillos best because ground cherries share the papery husk and slightly firm texture of tomatillos. Healthcare and Business COVID vaccine: Expect to see the updated COVID-19 vaccine in many Greater Cleveland pharmacies as early as this week. Hospitals and drug stores said they are waiting for the updated vaccine to gain final approval from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before they begin jabbing customers, reports Julie Washington. Crime and Courts Stolen mail: Seven men are accused of using stolen mail to fleece peopleâs identities and their cash.

Jurors hear differing theories Vanesa Gastellu, 31, is accused of murder in death of Christina Garcia, 23, found in a Chua Vista field in August 2020 Jurors heard vastly different theories Wednesday during opening statements in the murder trial of a 31-year-old woman accused of gunning down a former friend in Chula Vista. The prosecution said it intends to show that Vanesa Gastellu executed Christina Garcia, 23, because she believed the victim had caused Gastelluâs sometime-boyfriend to be fatally shot by police. Gastelluâs defense attorney told the jury the victim was actually shot to death by gang members who set her client up to take the fall. Garciaâs body was discovered on the morning of Aug. 5, 2020, in a field near Main Street west of Beyer Way. Deputy District Attorney Christopher Rhoads told jurors that Gastellu and others took Garcia to that field because they believed Garcia had âsnitchedâ to law enforcement, leading to the shooting death of their fellow gang member and Gastelluâs on-again, off-again boyfriend, David Angulo. Angulo, 33, was fatally shot by Chula Vista police on July 20, 2020, following a car chase in a stolen truck. Prosecutors said Angulo, who was a wanted suspect in three shootings, eventually ditched the stolen pickup and unsuccessfully tried to barge into a residence. Cornered, he pointed a gun at officers and was shot and killed, the District Attorneyâs Office said. Rhoads said that just prior to the fatal shooting, Garcia was with Angulo in an SUV, which was being tracked by police. At some point, Angulo ran from the SUV and carjacked the driver of a pickup truck, leading to the police pursuit and fatal shooting. Rhoads said Anguloâs death devastated Gastellu, who later allegedly told a friend, âI got word that Christina was with himâ and âIâm going to get to the bottom of this because someone snitched on him.â One night before Garciaâs death, Garcia messaged her mother about threats sheâd been receiving in connection with Anguloâs death. She told her mother she was going to confront the people threatening her, the prosecutor said. Garciaâs body was found the following morning. Sheâd been shot three times. Rhoads said Gastellu told several people that she was the killer, allegedly telling one person â(Angulo) was my man, so I dumped on her and I dumped her body.ââ The prosecutor also alleged Gastellu deleted location data on her phone and her Facebook account less than a day after the shooting. Gastelluâs defense attorney, Christine Basic, told jurors Garcia was killed by gang members who Gastellu âthought were her friends,â and those same people threatened Gastelluâs life in that field. Basic said Garciaâs killers âleft her to take the blameâ and spread rumors that she was involved. According to the attorney, a number of people who claimed Gastellu confessed to them had reasons to lie to police. Additionally, no physical evidence such as DNA could tie Gastellu to the murder, Basic said. The latest news, as soon as it breaks. Get our email alerts straight to your inbox.

Zakiya Dalila Harris' life inspired 'The Other Black Girl.' Then she cut the cord,9/13/23,2023-09-14T04:07:39Z,en,latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-09-13/zakiya-dalila-harris-the-other-black-girl-hulu,https://web.archive.org/web/20230914040739id_/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-09-13/zakiya-dalila-harris-the-other-black-girl-hulu,https://web.archive.org/web/20230914040739/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-09-13/zakiya-dalila-harris-the-other-black-girl-hulu,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGxhdGltZXMpL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtYXJ0cy90di9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTA5LTEzL3pha2l5YS1kYWxpbGEtaGFycmlzLXRoZS1vdGhlci1ibGFjay1naXJsLWh1bHU~,"Zakiya Dalila Harrisâ life inspired âThe Other Black Girl.â Why she had to cut the cord Four years ago, Zakiya Dalila Harris quit her job to as an editor at Knopf Doubleday to do something that, at the time, even she thought was crazy: write a novel. And not just any novel, but one that skewered the supposedly englightened book business through the eyes of a young Black woman stuck in a low-level assistant job at a prestigious, overwhelmingly white publishing house. To make it possible, Harris and the boyfriend sheâd been dating for less than a year began living together in a studio apartment in Midwood, a far-flung Brooklyn neighborhood. Over the course of a frantic summer, in between shifts at a cupcake shop and a creative writing workshop for kids, she finished a draft. âItâs insane. I donât know who that person was,â recalled Harris, over the din of sweet sweepers on a sweltering early September morning in Park Slope. âI was very desperate, and so tired of publishing.â The desperation didnât last long: Her debut novel, âThe Other Black Girl,â a creepily satirical, zeitgeist-capturing thriller aptly described as âThe Devil Wears Pradaâ meets âGet Out,â sparked a 14-way bidding war, sold to Atria for a reported sum of more than $1 million, became a bestseller, and received ecstatic reviews when it was published in 2021. (The Times called it a âperceptive exploration of racism in publishing, wrapped up in a whip-smart story of young women at war in the workplace.â) Naturally, Hollywood also came calling: before Harris had even handed in final edits on the manuscript, an adaptation was in the works at Hulu. On Wednesday, âThe Other Black Girlâ â a 10-episode series developed by Harris and Rashida Jones and produced by the Onyx Collective, Disneyâs diverse storytelling division â premiered on the streaming service. âIâm in a very small, privileged group of writers whoâs not only gotten something adapted within like, three years â which is crazy â but also, I was part of it. Itâs on a whole other level.â The series stars Sinclair Daniel as Nella Rogers, who has toiled away for two years as an assistant at Wagner Books, a Manhattan publishing house, where she is surrounded by white colleagues â circumstances that Nella, raised in the Connecticut âburbs, knows all too well. Already frustrated by her lack of career momentum, Nella is further demoralized when she raises concerns about a grossly stereotypical Black character in an upcoming book by one of Wagnerâs bestselling (white, male) authors, only to be silenced by her high-strung boss, Vera (Bellamy Young). Nella is also haunted by the mysterious fate of Kendra Rae Phillips, the first Black female editor at Wagner in the 1980s, who collaborated with another Black woman, Diana Gordon (Garcelle Beauvais) to create Nellaâs favorite book, âBurning Heartâ â then seemed to vanish without a trace. Based on the book by Zakiya Dalila Harris, this comedy, horror and mystery series on Hulu examines the realities of racism and sexism in the workplace. So Nella is understandably ecstatic when she learns that another Black woman, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), has been hired at Wagner â even if Hazel, with her Howard degree, Harlem roots and seemingly âauthenticâ Blackness, stirs both admiration and inadequacy in her. The women bond over their shared experiences (and mutual love of âBurning Heartâ) but Nella quickly grows wary of her seemingly perfect new colleague. Her concerns multiply when she receives a note telling her, âLeave Wagner now.â âIâm really proud of it,â said Harris, sitting outside a cafe where the baristas greet her with a familiar wave. âI think readers will really be excited about the changes we made â and the changes we didnât make.â Still, the editor in her head canât help but be nervous. âI know Iâm oftentimes more vocal about shows I donât like than I am about books. So Iâm just bracing myself for that.â No doubt some of Harrisâ anxiety stems from her deep connection to the seriesâ protagonist. Like Nella, Harris grew up in Connecticut and had literary aspirations from a young age. Storytelling was in her DNA: her father, Frank Harris III, is a journalism professor and former columnist at the Hartford Courant. Her sister is writer and critic Aisha Harris, who hosts an NPR podcast and provoked the rage of Megyn Kelly with a piece questioning why Santa Claus was assumed to be a white man. Harris fondly recalls how her father would always be grading a stack of papers or jotting down ideas on paper and how, as a family, âweâd come up with stories on our way to karate class and piano lessons.â In an early experiment in self-publishing, Harris would write and illustrate books using stacks of printer paper. (She still has one of them, called âArenât You Tired Yet?â) After studying English literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she applied to a fiction writing program at the New School in New York. She was wait-listed, but was admitted to the nonfiction program. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise: she took a class with the poet and activist Hettie Jones, who liked her writing, urged her to consider a publishing career and helped make some introductions. By the fall of 2016, not long after she completed her graduate studies, Harris started as an editorial assistant at Knopf Doubleday, long known for its literary fiction. âI was happy because I had insurance. I had great roommates. I was living the young professional life,â she said. But the bubble quickly burst. âAnd then I was like, âOK, publishing is a lot.â I loved the idea of getting to be an editor and acquiring my own titles. But at the time, it didnât feel like you could move up and have your own kind of agency for a very long time.â She wrote book reviews on the side, did some ghost-writing, and chipped away at another ambitious novel that remains unfinished. Then one day in the office bathroom, she ran into a Black woman sheâd never seen before. Harris was thrilled â but also immediately wondered who the woman was and why she suddenly seemed to materialize from nowhere. The encounter, though fleeting, lingered in her mind. âI was just thinking about, âWhy was I so excited?â And then the what-ifs. Like, what if sheâs a robot? Then I got the idea for this book, and just ran with it.â She started writing what would become âThe Other Black Girlâ in longhand, on Knopf stationery â something that helps her be less critical, she said â during quiet moments at her cubicle. (In the book, Nella is alerted to Hazelâs presence by the sudden smell of cocoa butter wafting in the air.) Within a few months, she quit her job. Working at a creative writing program for children that summer also helped fuel her. âBeing around kids who are just starting out brought me back to what writing was like pre-capitalism for me, where itâs just the pure thrill of it,â she said. She was revising the book and thinking about the adaptation in 2020 as George Floydâs murder sparked protests across the world and racial reckonings in countless powerful institutions and industries â including, yes, the book business. While the book âalready had the message of the commodification of Blackness and performative wokeness,â she said, the cultural climate only gave her more fodder. â2020 wasnât the first year, obviously, weâve had police shootings or people just going rogue against Black people. But I do feel like 2020 really made me home in on this part of my manuscript where Nella is really reflecting on her existence in this space. Even the moments where Nella is sitting at her desk, thinking about instances of police brutality and how hard it is to have to turn off that knowledge of whatâs going on in the world when you go to the office.â In addition to co-writing the pilot, Harris was part of the writers room, made up predominantly of people of color (as was the directing team). âI remember very much at the beginning, talking with the room about what we all wanted to see in the series and also our own personal experiences in the workplace with bosses who are annoying, but also with another Black person who wasnât looking out for us.â The writers often probed deep into Nellaâs psychology, and, to Harris, it sometimes felt intensely personal â âlike a therapy session for this character that isnât totally me,â she said. âBut, very much like her, I have anxieties about not being Black enough, about not being as cool as Hazel. Those are all versions of like fears that I had as a younger person.â She eventually sat down with Danielle Henderson, who was then the showrunner, to explain why she felt blocked and needed to change her relationship to the character: ââIâm cutting the cord. Iâm giving birth to this thing. And Iâm passing it on,ââ she said. âI am still very close to the book. But I had to very quickly divide myself from the character of Nella.â Still, there were other surreal moments â as when Harris visited the showâs Atlanta set and saw meticulously realized versions of the Wagner Books office and the cramped Brooklyn studio Nella shares with her boyfriend. âWeâre playing with an idea that I came up with in my studio apartment. And now thereâs a costume team devoted to outfits for these characters, who are now real people,â she said. Harris cites an eclectic array of influences on the series, from âNight of the Living Dead,â âThe Stepford Wives,â âKey & Peeleâ (especially the sketch about an a capella group that already has a Black guy), âRosemaryâs Baby,â and the novel âPassingâ by Nella Larsen. Most of the changes to the series are minor. We see more of Nellaâs life outside the office, including her boyfriend Owen (Hunter Parrish) and best friend, Malaika (Brittany Adebumola). And a pivotal plot point involving a surprisingly powerful form of hair grease is introduced earlier in the story. Perhaps the biggest change involves the ending. While the book version of âThe Other Black Girlâ ends on what can only be called a down note (âI am a morbid realist,â Harris said of the divisive conclusion), the Season 1 finale is more ambiguous, leaving the door open to interpretation â and a possible Season 2. âThatâs the hope,â said Harris, who is currently at work on a second novel and hopes to do more screenwriting once the writersâ strike is over. âIâve definitely imagined a world beyond the end of the book.â It's a date Get our L.A.

(AP) â Newly released investigative files in the police shooting death of a Grammy-winning sound engineer reveal there was an armed Tennessee Bureau of Investigation officer in the home when Mark Capps began threatening his family with guns Jan. 5. The officer, Zachery Silva, was the boyfriend of Mark Capps’ stepdaughter, McKenzie Acuff, according to the records. Silva told investigators he attempted to de-escalate the situation, eventually leaving the house around 5:30 a.m. after Mark Capps put down the weapons and returned to his bedroom. When Mark Capps, 54, fell asleep several hours later, and Acuff and her mother Tara Capps, Mark Capps’ wife, were able to leave the house and file a police report. Police later shot and killed Mark Capps when he pointed a gun at an officer after they tried to arrest him at his home. Mark Capps, who had won four Grammys for his work on polka albums more than a decade earlier, was depressed and suicidal and had reached out to several people in the days and hours before taking his family hostage, according to the report. The depression had been going on for months but got worse after his brother died Jan. 3. He had refused to give his brother, Jeff Capps, money and the two had been fighting. In a video call with Jeff Capps three weeks earlier, Mark Capps had put a gun to his own head. That same day Mark Capps had sent a photo of him pointing a gun to his head to friend Juanita Copeland. At least three other people knew Mark Capps was suicidal. Jeff Capps had told his former roommate, Tracey West, about the video. Meanwhile, Colleen Walters, who was a family friend, spoke with Mark Capps the day before his death. Walters told investigators Mark Capps made a FaceTime call to her where she saw a drawer full of pill bottles and he placed several guns on a bed. He told her the guns were for protection, but also that he had thought about suicide. Mark Capps also called his friend Josh Swift that same day, saying, âTell me not to do it.â Swift told investigators he told him that he was loved and eventually heard what sounded like guns being unloaded. Mark Capps called again that night complaining that his career was over. He called once more around 1:10 a.m. on Jan. 5, but his speech was difficult to understand and Swift told him to go to sleep. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention suggests that if someone is threatening suicide they should be taken seriously. Steps to help include calling or texting the 988 suicide prevention lifeline or accompanying them to a mental health facility or emergency room. The group also suggests helping to keep them safely away from lethal means like firearms. Tennessee does not have a red flag law that would allow police to temporarily take away a person’s guns if they were judged to be a danger to themselves or others. After a deadly shooting at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville in March, Republican Gov. Bill Lee proposed something similar â what he called an extreme risk protection order. When the legislature declined to take it up in the last days of the regular session, Lee called a special session for the end of August. But the Republican-dominated General Assembly once again failed to even consider Lee’s proposal. In the hours before Mark Capps began threatening his family, he had been drinking and taking pills, Tara Capps and Acuff told investigators. Around 2 a.m. Mark Capps pulled a pair of pistols out of a drawer. He began berating his wife and threatening to kill everyone in the house, including the dogs. Acuff went downstairs, but Silva, the officer, was still in an upstairs bedroom, listening to what was going on. Mark Capps said if they called law enforcement, they would all die. Eventually, he demanded that Silva come downstairs without his gun. Silva, Acuff and Tara Capps all worked to de-escalate the situation, according to the report. Silva told Mark Capps he was a good man and that he knew he âwouldn’t do anything to harm someone he loves,â according to the report. Around 5 a.m., Mark Capps agreed to put the guns back in the bedroom. He finally went to bed about 30 minutes later and Silva left for work. However, Mark Capps continued to verbally abuse his wife until he fell asleep at around 8:30 a.m., according to the report. That’s when Tara Capps and Acuff took the dogs and went to a nearby police station. David Dyer, CEO of the National De-escalation Training Center, which offers de-escalation training to law enforcement agencies and private sector enterprises, shared his observations of Silva’s engagement with Mark Capps with The Associated Press. âThe fact that he was armed but didn’t go in guns ablazing â kudos to him for thinking, âLetâs talk this guy down,'” Dyer said. Dyer said de-escalation exists on a continuum with use of force, and they teach officers to be âreasonable and prudent.â He also said that domestic violence situations are some of the most deadly for officers responding to calls for service. Dyer said he did not want to second guess the police response later that day. Nashville has a project called Partners in Care that teams counselors from the city’s Mental Health Cooperative with officers to respond to mental health emergencies where there is a gun or other danger present. Instead, members of the Metro Nashville Police Special Response Tactical team returned to the Capps’ home around 2 p.m. They planned to place charges at the doors and then announce that the home was surrounded and that Mark Capps should surrender. Instead, Mark Capps opened the front door as police were placing a charge there. One of the officers shot and killed him. The three officers who were near the door all told investigators that Mark Capps was pointing a gun at them. Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to look into the shooting and determined that no criminal charges would be filed against any of the law enforcement officers. Asked whether the Bureau looked into why police chose to approach the house with a SWAT team, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said in an email that “the investigation was purely focused on the facts of what happened for the district attorney to review.” Metro Nashville Police, in turn, directed the AP to the TBI report for any questions about the operation."

Safir’s son told The New York Times his father had died Monday at a hospital in Annapolis, Maryland, from a sepsis infection. He was 81. Current New York Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban issued a statement extending the department’s condolences and saying that Safir, who held the role from 1996 to 2000, “was a devoted, dynamic leader.” Safir was named to the NYPD’s top spot by then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had appointed him as fire commissioner two years earlier. Safir succeeded William Bratton, who had instituted policing tactics that had seen success in bringing down the annual number of murders but who left after having a falling out with Giuliani. The murder count continued to fall under Safir, with under 700 the year he left the job, compared with more than 1,100 the year before he started. But some of the city’s most heated moments of racial tension occurred during Safir’s time in the job as well. In 1997, police arrested Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, and officers brutalized him in the police precinct. In 1999, four plainclothes officers shot Amadou Diallo, from Guinea, outside his building in the Bronx, thinking his wallet was a weapon. In 2000, an undercover officer approached Patrick Dorismond, a Black man, in an attempt to buy drugs. After Dorismond took offense, a tussle broke out, and an officer shot and killed him. The incidents all spurred outrage at the department and its leadership."

The sheriff issued the statement after the state Attorney General’s Office released a video of the shooting on Sept. 6 in the parking lot of a mobile home park in DeWitt. The video comes from a security camera at a home facing the parking lot; the officer had not turned on his body camera.  This is the full statement Shelley released:  “I am aware the Attorney General Office released the video today from the Officer Involved Shooting which occurred on September 6th 2023 with a member from my office. As I stated then and will again, I support Deputy (John ) Rosello.”  “I also support our legal process in this country and my office will continue to corporate with the Attorney General’s Office in any way we can. The Sheriff’s Office will not have any further comments until the investigation is complete. Please refer any further questions to the Attorney General’s Office.”  This is the video released by the AG’s Office:  The teens killed are Dhal Apet, 17, and Lueth Mo, 15. The sheriff’s office identified John Rosello, 34, as the deputy who fired three shots that killed the teens.  Shelley, in defending the deputy, said last week that Rosello was not able to get out of the car’s way because he was in a narrow space between his patrol vehicle and the workbench. That led him to fire at the car, he said.  The video released by the AG’s Office shows the deputy getting out of the way of the car as it leaves the parking lot.  After the shooting, the car with Apet and Mo fled and ended up crashing on Mooney Avenue in Syracuse where one teen was found dead and the other dying. The driver fled the scene.

Safir's son told The New York Times his father had died Monday at a hospital in Annapolis, Maryland, from a sepsis infection. He was 81. Current New York Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban issued a statement extending the department’s condolences and saying that Safir, who held the role from 1996 to 2000, “was a devoted, dynamic leader.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Safir was named to the NYPD's top spot by then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had appointed him as fire commissioner two years earlier. Safir succeeded William Bratton, who had instituted policing tactics that had seen success in bringing down the annual number of murders but who left after having a falling out with Giuliani. The murder count continued to fall under Safir, with under 700 the year he left the job, compared with more than 1,100 the year before he started. But some of the city's most heated moments of racial tension occurred during Safir's time in the job as well. Advertisement Article continues below this ad In 1997, police arrested Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, and officers brutalized him in the police precinct. In 1999, four plainclothes officers shot Amadou Diallo, from Guinea, outside his building in the Bronx, thinking his wallet was a weapon. In 2000, an undercover officer approached Patrick Dorismond, a Black man, in an attempt to buy drugs. After Dorismond took offense, a tussle broke out, and an officer shot and killed him. The incidents all spurred outrage at the department and its leadership."

Fitzpatrick declined to characterize the video or comment on the specifics of the case. The prosecutor said he has confidence in Attorney General Tish Jamesâ investigation. Under state law, the AG takes over investigations of fatal police shootings from local prosecutors. Dhal Apet, 17, and Lueth Mo, 15, were shot and killed by Deputy John Rosello, 34, last week when they were passengers in a stolen car. A video released Tuesday sheds light on Sheriff Toby Shelleyâs description of events and his claim that Roselloâs life was in imminent danger. Shelley said last week that the car came at Rosello, and he had no choice but to shoot. The video shows that Rosello was able to get out of the way without being injured. Rosello fired three shots at the car as the driver appeared to be trying to escape a parking lot. Itâs hard to tell exactly where the bullets hit the car. But the officer was standing on the passenger side of the car with his arm and gun extended. Jamesâ office has declined to comment on the investigation. Fitzpatrick offered some guidance for navigating the news to come. âThe case is being investigated by competent people. The truth and facts will eventually be known,â Fitzpatrick said. He said people will watch the video and come up with their own conclusions, but there are questions that must be answered that go beyond whatâs in the video. Fitzpatrick said information from the autopsy report, which has not yet been completed, will help shed light. Fitzpatrick also said investigators will look at the angle the bullets entered the car and how the two teens were seated in the car when they were shot. âThis is not going to be something resolved by the end of the week or the end of the month,â he said. âMy advice to people is: Be patient. Give the authorities the time to do it, and do it right.â Marnie Eisenstadt writes about people and public affairs in Central New York. Contact her anytime email | Twitter| Facebook | 315-470-2246."
Investigation shows armed officer was hostage at home of Grammy winner who was killed by police,9/12/23,2023-09-13T19:59:55Z,en,metro.us,https://www.metro.us/investigation-shows-armed-officer-was-hostage-at-home-of-grammy-winner-who-was-killed-by-police/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230913195955id_/https://www.metro.us/investigation-shows-armed-officer-was-hostage-at-home-of-grammy-winner-who-was-killed-by-police/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230913195955/https://www.metro.us/investigation-shows-armed-officer-was-hostage-at-home-of-grammy-winner-who-was-killed-by-police/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/dXMsbWV0cm8pL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tc2hvd3MtYXJtZWQtb2ZmaWNlci13YXMtaG9zdGFnZS1hdC1ob21lLW9mLWdyYW1teS13aW5uZXItd2hvLXdhcy1raWxsZWQtYnktcG9saWNl,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Newly released investigative files in the police shooting death of a Grammy-winning sound engineer reveal there was an armed Tennessee Bureau of Investigation officer in the home when Mark Capps began threatening his family with guns Jan. 5. The officer, Zachery Silva, was the boyfriend of Mark Capps’ stepdaughter, McKenzie Acuff, according to the records. Silva told investigators he attempted to de-escalate the situation, eventually leaving the house around 5:30 a.m. after Mark Capps put down the weapons and returned to his bedroom. When Mark Capps, 54, fell asleep several hours later, and Acuff and her mother Tara Capps, Mark Capps’ wife, were able to leave the house and file a police report. Police later shot and killed Mark Capps when he pointed a gun at an officer after they tried to arrest him at his home. Mark Capps, who had won four Grammys for his work on polka albums more than a decade earlier, was depressed and suicidal and had reached out to several people in the days and hours before taking his family hostage, according to the report. The depression had been going on for months but got worse after his brother died Jan. 3. He had refused to give his brother, Jeff Capps, money and the two had been fighting. In a video call with Jeff Capps three weeks earlier, Mark Capps had put a gun to his own head. That same day Mark Capps had sent a photo of him pointing a gun to his head to friend Juanita Copeland. At least three other people knew Mark Capps was suicidal. Jeff Capps had told his former roommate, Tracey West, about the video. Meanwhile, Colleen Walters, who was a family friend, spoke with Mark Capps the day before his death. Walters told investigators Mark Capps made a FaceTime call to her where she saw a drawer full of pill bottles and he placed several guns on a bed. He told her the guns were for protection, but also that he had thought about suicide. Mark Capps also called his friend Josh Swift that same day, saying, “Tell me not to do it.” Swift told investigators he told him that he was loved and eventually heard what sounded like guns being unloaded. Mark Capps called again that night complaining that his career was over. He called once more around 1:10 a.m. on Jan. 5, but his speech was difficult to understand and Swift told him to go to sleep. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention suggests that if someone is threatening suicide they should be taken seriously. Steps to help include calling or texting the 988 suicide prevention lifeline or accompanying them to a mental health facility or emergency room. The group also suggests helping to keep them safely away from lethal means like firearms. Tennessee does not have a red flag law that would allow police to temporarily take away a person’s guns if they were judged to be a danger to themselves or others. After a deadly shooting at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville in March, Republican Gov. Bill Lee proposed something similar — what he called an extreme risk protection order. When the legislature declined to take it up in the last days of the regular session, Lee called a special session for the end of August. But the Republican-dominated General Assembly once again failed to even consider Lee’s proposal. In the hours before Mark Capps began threatening his family, he had been drinking and taking pills, Tara Capps and Acuff told investigators. Around 2 a.m. Mark Capps pulled a pair of pistols out of a drawer. He began berating his wife and threatening to kill everyone in the house, including the dogs. Acuff went downstairs, but Silva, the officer, was still in an upstairs bedroom, listening to what was going on. Mark Capps said if they called law enforcement, they would all die. Eventually, he demanded that Silva come downstairs without his gun. Silva, Acuff and Tara Capps all worked to de-escalate the situation, according to the report. Silva told Mark Capps he was a good man and that he knew he “wouldn’t do anything to harm someone he loves,” according to the report. Around 5 a.m., Mark Capps agreed to put the guns back in the bedroom. He finally went to bed about 30 minutes later and Silva left for work. However, Mark Capps continued to verbally abuse his wife until he fell asleep at around 8:30 a.m., according to the report. That’s when Tara Capps and Acuff took the dogs and went to a nearby police station. David Dyer, CEO of the National De-escalation Training Center, which offers de-escalation training to law enforcement agencies and private sector enterprises, shared his observations of Silva’s engagement with Mark Capps with The Associated Press. “The fact that he was armed but didn’t go in guns ablazing — kudos to him for thinking, ‘Let’s talk this guy down,'” Dyer said. Dyer said de-escalation exists on a continuum with use of force, and they teach officers to be “reasonable and prudent.” He also said that domestic violence situations are some of the most deadly for officers responding to calls for service. Dyer said he did not want to second guess the police response later that day. Nashville has a project called Partners in Care that teams counselors from the city’s Mental Health Cooperative with officers to respond to mental health emergencies where there is a gun or other danger present. Instead, members of the Metro Nashville Police Special Response Tactical team returned to the Capps’ home around 2 p.m. They planned to place charges at the doors and then announce that the home was surrounded and that Mark Capps should surrender. Instead, Mark Capps opened the front door as police were placing a charge there. One of the officers shot and killed him. The three officers who were near the door all told investigators that Mark Capps was pointing a gun at them. Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to look into the shooting and determined that no criminal charges would be filed against any of the law enforcement officers. Asked whether the Bureau looked into why police chose to approach the house with a SWAT team, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said in an email that “the investigation was purely focused on the facts of what happened for the district attorney to review.” Metro Nashville Police, in turn, directed the AP to the TBI report for any questions about the operation."

Mylett was appointed in August 2021 after the city conducted a nationwide search. His retirement is effective as of Jan. 1. Mylett led the department during the June 2022 fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker, an incident that sparked nationwide attention and fueled the countryâs conversation around police shootings. In a press release from the city, Mylett thanked Mayor Dan Horrigan, the police department and Akron citizens. âIt is with great difficulty that I make this decision to step away, but I do think the time is right based on many different factors,â he said in a statement. âI am proud to end my 35 years in policing in Akron.â Horrigan thanked Mylett for his âhis outstanding, dedicated service to our community through a very trying time.â âI know Steve to be a man of honor with the utmost care for the communities he has served,â he said. âAkron was lucky to have him at the helm, and I am grateful to have had him by my side through the last two years. I wish him and his family the best in their future endeavors.â Mylett was selected as one of four finalists for the position through an internal interview process, the city said. Prior to offering the position to Mylett, Horrigan issued a community survey with nearly 1,500 responses and hosted a public town hall with nearly 1,000 views on YouTube. Previously, Mylett served as the chief of the Bellevue, Washington, Police Department since 2015. Eight Akron police officers on June 27, 2022, fired 94 shots at Walker following a police chase, hitting him 45 times. Protests broke out in Akron after Walkerâs death and again after a grand jury rejected charges against the officers. Mylett defended the officersâ actions, and he refused to release the names of the officers involved. The officersâ names remain hidden from the public. Walkerâs family filed a federal civil lawsuit against the city and police department over the shooting. The lawsuit seeks $45 million from the city. Another civil lawsuit was filed against Akron police who protestors accused of using excessive force and wrongfully arresting protestors during demonstrations. That case remains on-going. âThis past year has been very difficult for many, many people, and the road ahead to regain what was lost will be no easy feat,â Mylett said. âHowever, I hold tremendous optimism for the future of this city, and I know everyone in this city wants a safe and secure Akron in order to raise our families and to live in peace.â Horrigan said in a statement he plans to work with presumptive Mayor Shammas Malikâs transition team regarding a search for the next police chief, the city said in a press release. âThe next Mayor will have the opportunity to lead a search and select the next head of the Akron Police Department,â the release said. Cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer reached out to Malik for comment."
"Former NYPD commissioner Howard Safir, who also held city’s top fire job, dies at 81",9/12/23,2023-09-13T19:26:02Z,en,nydailynews.com,https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/09/12/former-nypd-fdny-commissioner-howard-safir-dies/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230913192602id_/https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/09/12/former-nypd-fdny-commissioner-howard-safir-dies/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230913192602/https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/09/12/former-nypd-fdny-commissioner-howard-safir-dies/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55ZGFpbHluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzA5LzEyL2Zvcm1lci1ueXBkLWZkbnktY29tbWlzc2lvbmVyLWhvd2FyZC1zYWZpci1kaWVz,"Howard Safir, who was a loyal administrator who had the rare New York City distinction of serving as commissioner of both the police and fire departments, died on Monday.. He was 81. Safir, who warned in recent years that the Big Apple remained vulnerable to another terrorist attack, died on the 22nd anniversary of 9/11. No cause of death was immediately announced. As fire commissioner from 1994 through 1996 Safir visited every firehouse in the five boroughs, and led efforts to re-organize and re-equip the department, an effort that included stocking the department with life-saving bunker gear.As police commissioner from 1996 through 2000, the same man led a laudable reduction in crime while also reducing citizen complaints while establishing the department’s Courtesy, Professionalism & Respect program, with words still painted on the side of every police car in New York City. “Former NYPD Police Commissioner Howard Safir was a devoted, dynamic leader whose pioneering work in fugitive apprehension, illicit drug enforcement, and officer training is still emulated today,” said Edward Caban, the current police commissioner. “A public servant for more than three decades, Commissioner Safir dedicated his professional life to improving the lives of others. This noblest of pursuits guided him throughout – and on behalf of the entire New York City Police Department and all the people we serve,” Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh said. Safir’s FDNY contributions were “long lasting.” “He was relentless about making long-overdue improvements to the department, and we credit him with building a new FDNY headquarters in Brooklyn and improving training facilities on Randall’s Island,” Kavanagh said. But remarkably, Safir did not have ties to either department when then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani twice plucked him out of obscurity. Safir, a former federal drug agent, who was running a Washington-based security firm, had worked with Giuliani in the nation’s capital. The mayor tapped him to run the FDNY, and two years later, he appointed Safir as the NYPD commissioner. Safir, who was born in the Bronx, was brought in to replace William Bratton, the innovative top cop, who, despite his crime-fighting success, butted heads with Giuliani. Safir never upstaged Giuliani and seemed comfortable in his shadow, two important criteria for the job. Safir, as police commissioner, had his own success, but he also had his critics. The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association once gave Safir a vote of no-confidence, and Black community and elected leaders — outraged by the police shooting death of Amadou Diallo and the station house torture of Abner Louima — gave him bad grades. Since leaving the NYPD, Safir has been a security and intelligence consultant. “He found the perfect balance between public safety and people,” said retired NYPD Transit Chief Joseph Fox. “ He knew the importance of both. But a bigger fan of his than me, was my mom Josephine. She wrote him a get well card when as Commissioner he had a medical procedure done. She was so touched by the beautiful handwritten note he wrote back days later. Not lost on me is the significance of commissioner Safir transitioning on 9/11, a day that epitomizes the greatest service of all.” A memorial visitation for Safir will be held Sept. 20, from 10 a.m. to noon at John M. Taylor Funeral Home in Annapolis, Maryland, followed by a memorial service. Contributions may be made to Saint Jude Children’s Research Hospital or to theTunnel to Towers Foundation."

The attorney general is required by law to investigate all police killings. NYPD Assistant Chief of Patrol Borough Bronx Benjamin Gurley said Mamady Cisse, 22, was pacing around the Throgs Neck 7-Eleven at around 2:10 p.m. on Saturday when an employee stepped outside momentarily. The employee returned to find Cisse behind the cashier counter with a knife, standing beside a female employee who looked âvery nervous,â Gurley said at a news conference. Cisse was removing merchandise from behind the counter, police said. The employee ran to the NYPD 45th Precinct around the corner and returned with two officers, authorities said. âOne officer gave several commands to the male inside the location to take his hands out of his sweatshirt pocket,â Gurley said. Cisse didnât say anything to the officers, Gurley said, but revealed a knife and âlungedâ at one of them. The officer shot Cisse once in the torso, and Cisse was pronounced dead at 3:14 p.m. at Jacobi Hospital. âOfficers recovered knives at the scene,â a statement from the attorney generalâs office read. Cisse lived in the Soundview section of the Bronx, just a few miles from where he was killed. His family could not be reached for this story. The NYPDâs Force Investigation Division is also investigating. Police have not named either officer at the scene. When asked by a reporter, Gurley said last week that the officers involved will not be suspended. Police have body-worn camera footage and surveillance video of the incident, Gurley said. The cityâs medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide via ""gunshot wound of torso with injury of liver and major blood vessels."" This is the fourth known police killing in New York City in 2023. The attorney generalâs office released body-worn camera footage on Friday of a different fatal police shooting that took place on Roosevelt Island last month. This story has been updated with a ruling from the city's medical examiner."

Kirkpatrick, if approved, would be the permanent replacement for Shaun Ferguson, who retired from the job last year. The post has been held on an interim basis by Michelle Woodfork, a longtime veteran of the New Orleans department, who had also applied for the job. âWith over 35 years of experience in law enforcement, coupled with 20 years of leading police departments of even larger municipalities, Kirkpatrick has proven that she is more than capable and has what it takes to now lead the world-class NOPD,” Cantrell said in a news release. Kirkpatrick’s job history includes six years as chief of police in Spokane. She was tapped to help with police reform efforts in Chicago under then-Mayor Rahm Emmanuel in 2017. But she left that job soon afterward to head up Oakland’s police department. She was fired in Oakland in 2020. But she filed a whistleblower claim against the city, alleging she was fired for calling out unethical behavior by the civilian commission that oversees the police department. She eventually received a $1.5 million payment. Kirkpatrick has been hailed as a reformer by her supporters. If she is approved by the City Council, she would head a police department that has been operating under a broad reform agreement with the U.S. Justice Department that was approved by a federal judge in 2013. It was the result of federal investigations growing out of deadly police shootings of civilians in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Also facing the new chief: a force that has been steadily dropping in manpower in recent years, even amid jumps in violent crime during the COVID-19 pandemic. Voters approved a measure last year granting the council the right to approve or reject a nominee for police chief. Council Vice President Helena Moreno, among critics of the selection process, did not guarantee approval in a statement reacting to the nomination. âAll I have asked for during the search for a new police chief is that the very best candidate be chosen in a transparent and fair process,” Moreno said. “Arguably, transparency has been an issue, but hopefully, more can be brought to light as we move toward the confirmation process. I look forward to learning more about Anne Kirkpatrick, her previous work, and most importantly, her plans to make the city of New Orleans safer and improve our NOPD.â"

Almost one third of the 88 sworn positions in his department were vacant, giving him 24 jobs to fill as quickly as possible. He wasn’t alone in that predicament. Many California police departments have reported serious hiring challenges in a persistently tight labor market over the past several years. But Joshi’s city council in April gave him something exceptional to lure candidates to Alameda: a $75,000 enlistment bonus in addition to regular pay that starts at $110,000 a year. It’s working. After receiving 170 applications from all over the country, the Alameda Police Department now has enough officers enrolled in academies to bring its projected total vacancies down to 10 by early next year. Joshi credits the bonuses, in part, for attracting applicants to a city with an expensive cost of living. “There are million dollar homes here. The average rent here is also $3,000,” said Joshi, who hopes the extra cash bonus could ease the financial burden on officers who are expected to live in the East Bay’s pricey housing market. Alameda’s high dollar bonuses are an attention-grabbing example of the fierce competition among California law enforcement agencies trying to replenish the ranks of officers who retired or changed careers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, cities are offering lucrative new contracts and incentives for law enforcement officers throughout the state. The Los Angeles City Council last month approved a four-year $384 million contract for police officers that sharply raises starting pay and provides retention bonuses to officers with as little as two years of experience. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors in April approved a contract that raises starting pay for entry-level officers to about $108,000, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The city is offering $5,000 signing bonuses, too. Closer to Alameda in the East Bay, Richmond in October adopted a police contract that raises pay by 20% over 26 months. Another Alameda neighbor, El Cerrito, offered a $10,000 signing bonus to attract new recruits. Alameda Mayor Marilyn Ashcraft acknowledged the $75,000 bonus has been “a little bit eye-popping.” But, she added, “more of what I hear is envy” from leaders in other cities who would like to match or beat the offer. The danger, said retired Redondo Beach Police Department lieutenant Diane Goldstein, is a widening divide between the cities and counties that can afford to pay big bonuses to address their staffing shortages and those that can’t. “This whole signing bonus started a few years back. It creates police agencies of the haves and the have-nots,” said Goldstein, the executive director of the Law Enforcement Action Partnership, a nonprofit that supports improving police-community relations. “It may be a well-intentioned policy, thinking they can attract the best and brightest, but it creates inequities potentially in policing,” she said. More California police, and more accountability The police hiring perks come as California cities address conflicting demands from their constituents after the civil rights protests that followed George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. A January 2023 survey found that 49% of adults say police spending in their area should be increased while 13% said spending should be decreased, according to the Pew Research Center. Some Californians are especially concerned about rising crime. The Oakland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for instance, in July wrote a letter calling on city leaders to declare a state of emergency due to rising crime. “People are moving out of Oakland in droves. They are afraid to venture out of their homes to go to work, shop, or dine in Oakland and this is destroying economic activity. Businesses, small and large, struggle and close, tax revenues vanish, and we are creating the notorious doom-loop where life in our city continues to spiral downward,” the letter read. But Americans after Floyd’s killing have also asked for “major changes” in the way policing is practiced, according to a Gallup poll from 2020. Those changes include holding officers accountable for abuses of power and capping law enforcement spending in the interest of hiring social workers or other professionals to respond to more emergency calls. California lawmakers responded to those appeals by passing bills that empower a commission to decertify police officers accused of misconduct and require the state Department of Justice to investigate most fatal police shootings. This year police accountability advocates pressed for other bills, including one that would limit the use of police stops for bicyclists and drivers for low-level traffic stops and minor infractions, like expired license plates. “Instead of putting more money toward police departments and creating those huge hiring bonuses, cities could look at the moment we’re currently in and say maybe it’s time to reduce our police force and invest more in alternatives,” said Eliana Machefsky, a legal fellow for the National Police Accountability Project. Natasha Minsker, a policy adviser at the nonprofit Smart Justice California, said law enforcement agencies should focus on changing their cultures. “Pay them a fair wage, whatever that is. People should get paid a fair wage,” Minsker said about about the recent hikes in officer pay. “It doesn’t matter how much you pay them, it’s how much you change the culture.” How a small East Bay city recruits Many California police chiefs say they’re trying to figure out how to both fill their ranks while also improving relationships in their communities. El Cerrito, a city of 26,000 nestled north of Berkeley, has faced staffing issues of its own. The average price of a home hovers around $1 million, just like Alameda and their neighbors in the inner Bay Area. “I think if you are motivated by higher pay, there’s not much we can do to stop you,” said El Cerrito Mayor Lisa Motoyama, who said she has little wiggle room to fix staffing woes in the city’s $14 million police budget. “There’s no way we can match Alameda. We can’t compete.” From 2020 to 2021, El Cerrito lost 21 officers. Among those departures, nine were retirements or resignations and 12 transferred to other police and sheriff’s departments, including Solano, Marin, Walnut Creek, and Contra Costa, according to the police chief. “The most common reasons cited in our exit interviews were the desire to be closer to home or have more opportunities for personal growth in a new agency,” El Cerrito Police Chief Paul Keith said in an email. Keith first noticed the staffing crisis after the summer of 2020. Ever since then, he has continued to hear officers express dissatisfaction with their careers.“They also predominantly left for agencies that paid more money,” he added. The city stepped in with some new perks, including free gym memberships and dry cleaning. Then it kicked in some extra money. “We tried to institute a recruitment bonus which is nowhere near that $75,000,” Motoyama said. Instead, the El Cerrito department offered a $10,000 signing bonus. “Four months ago we had a big swearing in, lots of women. Whatever we’re doing is working,” she said. As of this summer, El Cerrito has 36 officers, leaving just one vacancy."

Kirkpatrick, if approved, would be the permanent replacement for Shaun Ferguson, who retired from the job last year. The post has been held on an interim basis by Michelle Woodfork, a longtime veteran of the New Orleans department, who had also applied for the job. “With over 35 years of experience in law enforcement, coupled with 20 years of leading police departments of even larger municipalities, Kirkpatrick has proven that she is more than capable and has what it takes to now lead the world-class NOPD,” Cantrell said in a news release. Kirkpatrick’s job history includes six years as chief of police in Spokane. She was tapped to help with police reform efforts in Chicago under then-Mayor Rahm Emmanuel in 2017. But she left that job soon afterward to head up Oakland’s police department. She was fired in Oakland in 2020. But she filed a whistleblower claim against the city, alleging she was fired for calling out unethical behavior by the civilian commission that oversees the police department. She eventually received a $1.5 million payment. Kirkpatrick has been hailed as a reformer by her supporters. If she is approved by the City Council, she would head a police department that has been operating under a broad reform agreement with the U.S. Justice Department that was approved by a federal judge in 2013. It was the result of federal investigations growing out of deadly police shootings of civilians in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Also facing the new chief: a force that has been steadily dropping in manpower in recent years, even amid jumps in violent crime during the COVID-19 pandemic. Voters approved a measure last year granting the council the right to approve or reject a nominee for police chief. Council Vice President Helena Moreno, among critics of the selection process, did not guarantee approval in a statement reacting to the nomination. “All I have asked for during the search for a new police chief is that the very best candidate be chosen in a transparent and fair process,” Moreno said. “Arguably, transparency has been an issue, but hopefully, more can be brought to light as we move toward the confirmation process. I look forward to learning more about Anne Kirkpatrick, her previous work, and most importantly, her plans to make the city of New Orleans safer and improve our NOPD.”"

Edmonds Police said the off-duty officer noticed the thieves trying to get inside his Hyundai Santa Fe at about 5:30 a.m. The officer told local police the suspects drove right at him and knocked him to the ground. He then shot at the thieves as they drove away, according to police. Authorities said the lone bullet struck a nearby fence. The officer was taken to a local hospital to be treated for minor injuries. Edmonds police are still working to determine if the cop used a personal gun to shoot at the thieves or if he used a weapon issued to him by Seattle police. Authorities later found the stolen Hyundai had been abandoned in Burien. Local NBC affiliate KING-TV said Seattle police have opened their own investigation into the incident since it is technically considered an officer-involved shooting. • Matt Delaney can be reached at mdelaney@washingtontimes.com.

The encounter unfolded just before 11:30 a.m. in the city’s West Garfield Park neighborhood, the Chicago Police Department said. Officers were conducting an unknown investigation at a West Wilcox Avenue building when a “female offender attempted to intervene.” An unknown person then unleashed two dogs on the cops and three of the officers allegedly sustained dog bites, according to the department. One of the officers fired his gun, striking one of the dogs. Neighbors said, however, that the canines did not deserve the use of force, according to a local report. Brenda Cunningham, who lives next door to the dogs’ owner said police had just detained one of her sons when they strolled near the canines’ property. The neighbor and his two dogs came outside to see what was happening, igniting fear in the officers, she said. “When the dogs came outside, the police got aggressive: ‘Get the dogs, get the dogs.’ They are grabbing the dogs. There are two dogs there. They are all grabbing the dogs,” Cunningham told ABC 7. “The dogs never got aggressive with these officers … The dog did not one time went after the officer to bite him or anything like that, ma’am. No, he did not. That officer just pulled out his gun and shot twice.” Another neighbor said the pet was shot in the face. The dog was taken to animal care and control, but it’s not clear what condition it is in. The three cops were taken to an area hospital and are in “good condition,” CHP said. The woman was arrested with charges pending, though it’s unclear what role she played in the chaos."

Sarno is far outpacing his competition.  The city’s longest serving mayor has raised about $150,000 this year alone. City Councilor Justin Hurst has raised the second-most donations this year, around $90,000, in his bid to unseat Sarno.  The five candidates — Sarno, Hurst, City Council President Jesse Lederman, state Rep. Orlando Ramos, D-Springfield, and mental health counselor David Ciampi — will face off Tuesday to narrow the field to two candidates ahead of the November election.  Candidates file regular state reports documenting their campaign donations. How much have the candidates raised and who were their top donors?  Domenic Sarno  Springfield incumbent mayor Domenic J. Sarno meets with the editorial board of The Republican newspaper. (Hoang 'Leon' Nguyen / The Republican)  As of Sept. 1, Sarno had about $87,000 on hand.  Since he was most recently sworn to office in early 2020, Sarno has raised $446,000, the majority of which he amassed over the past two years. In just 2023, Sarno’s campaign raised $154,000. That came after he raised $146,000 in December of last year, breaking a monthly record his campaign set in 2021.  “Fundraising is the worst part of campaigning, however it is necessary in order to get your message out to the public,” Sarno said in a statement Thursday. “I am very thankful and humbled that our campaign has received financial support from all segments of our community.”  Per state rules, individuals can only donate $1,000 each year to a candidate.  Over the past several years since Sarno’s last bid for re-election, top donors to his campaign include totals of $3,000 from Mark Keroack, CEO of Baystate Health, several thousand from an executive at USA Hauling, and $4,000 from the owner of Universal Electric, an electrical contracting company.  Other notable sums include various owners and executives at Peter Pan Bus Lines, who donated a total of $8,600 over the past several years, while owners and an executive at Pioneer Valley Hotel Group have donated more than $3,000.  Three administrators at the Springfield Parking Authority donated a total of $8,250 over the past several years.  Sarno’s current chief of staff donated $1,000. Springfield Police Superintendent Cheryl C. Clapprood has given $500 total, while former Springfield mayor and retired judge Mary Hurley donated $1,500 over the last two years.  Justin Hurst  Springfield mayoral candidate Justin Hurst meets with the editorial board of The Republican newspaper. (Don Treeger / The Republican) 8/10/2023  The city councilor announced his mayoral campaign last fall. After Sarno, he’s raised the most money this year: around $90,000 across more than 650 donations. Last year, he reported raising $47,000.  “I’m proud of the support we’ve received,” he said. “But more importantly, I’m proud of the actual work that’s been done by all of the volunteers — that speaks louder than the money that comes in.”  He had about $1,000 on hand as of Sept. 1.  Over the last two years, his top donors include $2,000 from real estate agent Daniel Hannoush, $2,000 from Jonathan Lemay, vice president of A Plus HVAC, and $2,000 from relator Migdalia Khatib.  He also has support from fellow City Councilor Tracye Whitfield, who donated $1,250. In the last two years, Hurst raised about $10,000 from donors who listed their employer as the city of Springfield or its public schools.  Jesse Lederman  Springfield mayoral candidate Jesse Lederman meets with the editorial board of The Republican newspaper. (Don Treeger / The Republican) 8/10/2023  City Council President Lederman has raised $69,000 this year and $26,000 last year.  “I’ve said from the beginning of this campaign, it’s not a race to see who can raise more money,” he said. “Money doesn’t win elections, principals and ideas win elections.” His goal, he said, was to raise enough money to compete. “We certainly have done that,” he said.  Lederman noted donations from unions, like the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1459 and the Massachusetts Nurses PAC. City Council Vice President Melvin Edwards also donated more than $500 to Lederman this year.  His funds also include a $7,000 candidate loan to himself.  As of Sept. 1, he had about $4,000 on hand.  Orlando Ramos  Massachusetts State Representative Orlando Ramos, a candidate for Springfield mayor, talks to the editorial board of The Republican newspaper. (Don Treeger / The Republican) 8/14/2023  Ramos raised about $37,000 this year and $27,000 last year. The current state representative announced in February he was running for mayor, and he already had $50,000 on hand from his successful campaign for the statehouse, which he said gave him a head start.  “I didn’t have to focus on fundraising; $50,000 was a good starting point for me,” he said. “I wanted to spend all of my time and energy meeting voters.”  Since announcing his mayoral run, his top donors this year include $1,000 from Anthony Soto, the superintendent of Holyoke Public Schools, and $1,000 from Jennifer Collins, the CEO of Sunrise Behavioral Health. Ramos also has several donations from unions, including several carpenters unions and the Massachusetts AFL–CIO.  As of last week, the most recent reporting deadline, Ramos had $17,600 on hand.  Ramos raised questions about some who have contributed to Sarno’s campaign.  “I am concerned with some of the people who have contributed to the mayor’s campaign,” he said. “People who have contributed to his war chest have benefited from decisions made by the mayor.”  Ramos pointed to sizeable donations from the owners of the building the city rents for a police shooting range.  David Ciampi  Springfield mayoral candidate David F. Ciampi meets with the editorial board of The Republican newspaper.

Gun threats against San Diego police officers are at a five-year high,9/10/23,2023-09-11T03:40:44Z,en,latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-10/gun-threats-against-san-diego-police-officers-are-at-a-five-year-high,https://web.archive.org/web/20230911034044id_/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-10/gun-threats-against-san-diego-police-officers-are-at-a-five-year-high,https://web.archive.org/web/20230911034044/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-10/gun-threats-against-san-diego-police-officers-are-at-a-five-year-high,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGxhdGltZXMpL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEvc3RvcnkvMjAyMy0wOS0xMC9ndW4tdGhyZWF0cy1hZ2FpbnN0LXNhbi1kaWVnby1wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNlcnMtYXJlLWF0LWEtZml2ZS15ZWFyLWhpZ2g~,"Gunfire erupted within 20 seconds of San Diego Police Officer Darwin Anderson’s arrival at the Encanto home.  A neighbor had called 911. A woman and her dog were lying in a driveway, shot. As Anderson pulled up, a man approached, distraught.  “I see my mother dead right there!” he shouted, pointing to a home on Iona Drive .  The officer made his way toward the 74-year-old woman. As he began to kneel next to her, a gunshot rang out. Anderson jumped up. Another shot.  “Oh my god, they’re shooting at the police officer,” the 911 caller told a dispatcher.  The Aug. 28 incident was the fourth time last month and the eighth time this year that someone used a gun to threaten or shoot at a San Diego police officer. In June, an officer was shot in the arm while chasing a man who ran from a stolen vehicle. Less than a month later, a gunman fatally shot a 4-year-old police dog named Sir.  Officers have faced more gun threats in 2023 than the previous two years combined, according to data maintained by the department’s homicide unit. The figures include incidents when people allegedly threaten officers with guns, point guns at officers or shoot at officers. This year’s total was the highest seen over five years.  Advertisement  “It’s horrifying,” San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said. “It just seems like I’m getting more and more calls. ‘Chief, we had an officer-involved shooting. We have officers being fired upon. A canine was just killed.’ It’s just all too common.”  It’s a phenomenon that’s touched other departments as well. In June, a man wanted in his girlfriend’s murder opened fire on Riverside County sheriff’s deputies and Oceanside police officers at the tail end of a pursuit, police said. Less than a month later, a man wanted on a felony warrant tried to fire a gun at a La Mesa police officer, but the weapon malfunctioned.  Like other forms of crime, deciphering why violence against officers rises or falls is nuanced. Homicide investigators noted that ghost guns, drug use and mental health struggles were regularly involved when officers faced gun threats. The District Attorney’s Office found that drug use and/or mental health played a role in nearly 80% of officer-involved shootings from 1993 to 2017.  Criminologists who study violence against police noted that high-profile cases that fuel existing feelings of injustice — like the murder of George Floyd — can also lead to increases, as can increases in crime.  While overall crime fell across San Diego in 2022, violent crime, fueled by a double-digit jump in robberies, inched up.  Police leaders, on the other hand, placed the blame on laws they say do a poor job at keeping habitual violent offenders — who might be quicker to use a firearm — behind bars.  The department’s data zero in on a specific kind of assault against police — threats involving guns — but overall assaults against San Diego officers have held fairly steady over the last two decades. In 2022, the most recent year that’s available, about 275 San Diego officers reported being assaulted in some way, according to FBI data. In 2000, about 285 officers reported assaults.  Advertisement  And across the nation, it’s generally a safer time to wear a badge, according to statistics kept by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund . In the 1970s, more than 2,300 officers were killed in the line of duty. That figure had fallen nearly 30% in the 2010s to about 1,700. Some of that decrease is likely attributed to better gear, better training and better trauma care when officers are injured, experts say.  Rise in ghost guns  During the hours-long incident in Encanto, 43-year-old Jesse Nelson would go on to fire multiple weapons at police, including the officer who tried to rescue Nelson’s dying mother, whom he’d shot. They were weapons he shouldn’t have had.  In 2000, Nelson was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for second-degree murder. He got another two years for possessing drugs, a sentence he served concurrently. He was released in 2015, and his parole supervision ended in 2020 without any violations, prison officials said.  Convicted felons are barred by state law from owning or possessing firearms. But there were at least five firearms in Nelson’s home, including two AR-15-style ghost guns. He was carrying one of the rifles when a police sniper fatally shot him.  Of the eight gun threats officers have faced this year, five of them involved non-serialized firearms, San Diego Police Lt. Steve Shebloski said.  Ghosts guns are do-it-yourself firearms assembled by hand from parts that often come in prepackaged kits. Because the pieces — like an unfinished gun frame — were not classified as guns, they didn’t have serial numbers. And, until recently, anyone could legally buy the parts.  Last year, however, the Biden administration changed the definition of a firearm under federal law to include its pieces so they can be tracked more easily. Those parts must now be licensed and include serial numbers, and manufacturers are required to run background checks before a sale. The requirement applies, no matter how the firearm is made — whether that be from individual pieces, a kit or 3-D printers.  The new rules are being challenged in court.  San Diego, both the city and county, as well as the state of California have also implemented laws to make the firearms more traceable.  Despite these changes, ghost guns have continued to crop up at crime scenes across the nation. So far this year, the San Diego Police Department has seized about 1,600 firearms — more than 20% of which were non-serialized, officials said.  “I think the biggest issue that I’ve noticed, at least this last year, is the availability of ghost guns and the the amount of people that are using them,” Shebloski said.  A decade ago, acquiring a gun typically meant purchasing one, the lieutenant said. For convicted felons, this posed a challenge. While criminals had the option to steal or illegally buy guns, today they have the means to produce them directly.  “They literally can go on YouTube and find how to make a ghost gun,” Shebloski said.  Community leaders who work to reduce gun violence agreed that more firearms on the street puts everyone at risk — including police officers.  “I believe guns can get into the wrong hands,” said Cornelius Bowser , founder of Shaphat Outreach. “We have too many guns on the streets, and too many people have access to them. That makes things dangerous for everyone.”  Repeat offenders  When questioned about what he thought was driving an increase in gun threats, Nisleit pointed to the case of Justin Teague.  Police shot the 39-year-old after he opened fire on officers responding to a report of car burglaries in a University City parking garage on Aug. 11 , department officials said.  It wasn’t Teague’s first police shooting. In 2003, when he was just 19, he was shot by police who said he drove a stolen Honda at them as he tried to flee. A year later he was was sentenced for driving or taking a vehicle without consent. And in 2017, he was sentenced for charges that included identity theft and buying or receiving a stolen vehicle.  When police confronted Teague last month, he was out on $50,000 bail for a July incident involving a car theft and evading police.  Nisleit argued that many of the people shooting at officers are “hardened criminals who are constantly coming in and out of the system.”  “They really don’t have much fear of shooting at us.”  Nisleit blamed a lax criminal justice system for taking a softer stance on repeat offenders like Teague who too often wind up in altercations with officers. He added that such encounters can be particularly demoralizing for officers.  “The morale is hurt by the fact that officers do not feel that these criminals are being held accountable, that jails have become a revolving door, that the justice system is not sentencing these people to the appropriate amount of time,” he said.  After George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, protesters challenged law enforcement agencies across the nation to rethink public safety. Critics argued that the current system is inherently racist, which leads to racial profiling, over-policing and use of excessive force — especially in communities of color.  Some demanded that departments be defunded, while others called for getting rid of certain police protections like qualified immunity, a legal defense which shields officers and deputies who are accused of violating constitutional rights.  Dr. Maria Haberfeld , professor and chair of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said tensions between communities and police departments can be inflamed by politicians and the media who amplify and normalize anti-police sentiments. Sentiments that could lead to an increase in crimes against police, she said.  “Each time that there is a high-profile event that is perceived as an overreach by the government, the police is on the receiving end of the public’s frustration and anger,” she said. “When these high-profile events confirm the feelings of injustice, like racism for example, the anger escalates.”  Nisleit, whose department has been criticized for failing to aggressively tackle issues such as racial disparities in police stops, said he supports “smart, intentional police reform.” But he argued some new laws place the rights of suspects over victims.  “Having to go to the loved ones of the officers who get shot, seeing the trauma, the fear on their faces — it sucks,” Nisleit said. “They’re no different than any other victim of violent crime. I don’t think people are paying attention to that.”"

At 7 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 9, police went to a residence on Richmond Road in Hancock. Sabourinâs statement reads that the officer encountered a man with a weapon. âInitial investigations indicate that when the officer arrived an individual armed with a weapon approached and would not back down following requests to stop resulting in the officer discharging his weapon,â the statement read. Police performed CPR on the man and the county ambulance was called, but the man was pronounced dead before being taken to the hospital, according to the statement. Pittsfield police came to the home shortly after the shooting and assisted in resuscitation efforts, the statement read. The District Attorneyâs Office and the State Police Detective Unit assigned to the office are investigating along with other specialized units of the State Police and the investigation is in its early stages, according to the statement. Reached Sunday, Sabourin said there was no update regarding the investigation or the identity of the man who was killed. Hancock, a town that had just over 750 residents as of the 2020 U.S. Census, does not have its own police force, according to the statement."

The fatal shooting came after officers responded to 911 calls of a man threatening his family with a knife at their apartment building in an apparent mental health crisis.  The footage, which was released by the state Attorney General’s office, shows the perspectives of four NYPD officers at the scene: Three who entered the building’s elevator — one with a riot shield — around 11:30 p.m. on August 4, while another remained in the lobby with a Roosevelt Island Public Safety Department officer.  Before the elevator door closed, the man, identified by police Monday as Azar Benzitun, ran up and lunged with a knife at the Roosevelt Island officer, according to the footage. His face is blurred in the videos.  The videos show the man then turned to the three police officers in the elevator, identified as Daniel Mehr, Annie Virella-Abreu and Daniel Mazza. Virella-Abreu shot at the man with a taser, the videos show.  Within a second, as the man took another step forward, the footage shows Mehr unleashed a flurry of gunshots while Mazza fired at least once.  Virella-Abreu also drew her gun after firing her taser, but it’s unclear from the footage whether she actually fired.  Just eight seconds passed between the man first lunging with the knife and laying flat on the ground after being shot, according to the videos.  The videos show he shakily raised his right hand, still holding the knife, while on the ground. Mehr moved toward him with a raised gun. “Drop the knife!” he yells.  “Hold on, hold on, hold on,” Virella-Abreu said as she pushed Mehr’s cocked arm down.  The man was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital at 12:28 a.m., police said.  NYPD Assistant Chief Christine Bastedenbeck of Patrol for Borough Queens North said at a press conference last month one of the man’s family members told 911 dispatchers he was “off his medication and under the influence of marijuana.”  An NYPD spokesperson said officers are trained on how to manage people experiencing mental health crises, and said a ""significant portion"" of the department's members have received crisis intervention training. Recruits at the NYPD Academy are taught about mental illness and proper communication, the spokesperson said.  The Attorney General’s office, which is legally required to assess all police killings, has been investigating the incident. Mehr, Virella-Abreu and Mazza joined the department relatively recently, between 2018 and 2020.  Police records show Mehr was trained in what the NYPD calls “responding to people in crisis,” which includes a video series and two audio modules.  Virella-Abreu received the same crisis response training as Mehr, plus two extra sessions including one about “sending the right signals.”  The incident followed a string of police shootings in recent years. Raul de la Cruz was shot outside his dad’s Bronx apartment building in March during a schizophrenic episode in which he was holding a knife. Kawaski Trawick, another Bronx man, was fatally shot inside his apartment while holding a butter knife and stick in 2018. Saheed Vassell was unarmed, shot and killed in Brooklyn in 2018.  The city has struggled to respond to mental health emergencies where someone has a weapon without using force.  The city has in some cases sent mobile crisis teams of nurses, social workers and psychiatrists to respond to mental health crises. New Yorkers living with mental illness have also pushed to expand the budget and staff for 988 – a crisis hotline – to replace 911 as the city’s default system for reporting mental health emergencies.  But when someone in crisis has a knife, authorities say those teams aren’t equipped to respond alone. Advocacy groups and police officers have agreed that the NYPD doesn’t sufficiently prepare officers to respond to mental health emergencies. Fountain House has pushed the NYPD to improve training for officers, with an emphasis on de-escalation tactics when responding to mental health crises.  This story has been updated with the name of the man who was shot, and comments from an NYPD spokesperson."

The incident happened about 12:45 a.m. after police spotted the truck in a dirt lot near Carlsbad Boulevard and Palomar Airport Road. One adult, four teenagers and alcohol were inside the vehicle, police said. Officers were telling some of the occupants to get out of the vehicle, when a 16-year-old boy sitting in the front passengerâs seat got out the truck without being asked, police said. The teen started reaching under his seat, and officers immediately ordered him to stop. The boy pulled a firearm from inside the truck, and as he turned toward one of the officers, that officer opened fire, striking the teen in the right arm, police said. The boy ran west toward the ocean and either jumped or fell down the side of a nearby cliff, according to police. Officers were able to reach him and took him into custody and provided medical aid, including using a tourniquet. The boy was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive his injuries. The officer who shot the teen has been with the department for four months, police said. He is currently assigned to patrol. A firearm was found along the cliff side where the teen fell. Officers were working to collect other pieces of evidence, as well. Per a countywide agreement that ensures no local agency investigates its own police shootings, the San Diego Police Department will investigate the incident. The Carlsbad Police Department will also conduct an administrative review of the shooting. The latest news, as soon as it breaks. Get our email alerts straight to your inbox.

Police fatally shoot Bronx man inside 7-Eleven after alleged knife threat,9/9/23,2023-09-11T01:31:20Z,en,gothamist.com,https://gothamist.com/news/police-fatally-shoot-man-in-bronx,https://web.archive.org/web/20230911013120id_/https://gothamist.com/news/police-fatally-shoot-man-in-bronx,https://web.archive.org/web/20230911013120/https://gothamist.com/news/police-fatally-shoot-man-in-bronx,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGdvdGhhbWlzdCkvbmV3cy9wb2xpY2UtZmF0YWxseS1zaG9vdC1tYW4taW4tYnJvbng~,"Police fatally shot a man inside a Bronx 7-Eleven on Saturday afternoon after police say he threatened an officer and an employee with a knife. The man, who police have not named but told Gothamist was 22 years old and Black, paced around the Throgs Neck convenience store for roughly 20 minutes around 2:10 p.m., according to the NYPD. An employee who had stepped outside the store returned to find the man standing behind the cashier counter holding a knife beside a female employee who looked âvery nervous,â NYPD Assistant Chief of Patrol in the Bronx Benjamin Gurley said during a news conference. The man was allegedly pulling merchandise off the shelves. An employee ran to the NYPD 45th precinct around the corner and returned with two police officers. âAs the officers approached, one officer gave several commands to the male inside the location to take his hands out of his sweatshirt pocket,â Gurley said. The man didnât say anything to the police officers, according to Gurley, but revealed a knife and lunged at one of them. The officer shot the man once in the torso, police said. âBoth officers then immediately rendered first aidâ and called for an emergency medical response, Gurley said. The man was pronounced dead at 3:14 p.m. at Jacobi Hospital, according to police. Gurley said it was the first time a 7-Eleven employee had seen the man, but said he lived in the Bronx. The chief said he âhad police contact before,â but would not provide details of his arrest record. The officer, who police declined to name, will not be suspended, Gurley said. Police have body worn camera footage and surveillance video of the incident, Gurley said. The cityâs medical examiner has not released a report on the manâs cause of death. This is the fourth known police killing in New York City in 2023. A spokesperson for the state Attorney General, who is required by law to investigate all police killings, said the office is conducting a preliminary review of the incident. In April, police shot and killed a 78-year-old man in his doorway while looking for a burglary suspect. Last month, police fatally shot a man inside an apartment building lobby who was reportedly experiencing a mental health crisis. Several weeks later, a NYPD sergeant chucked a picnic cooler at a man fleeing police, knocking him off his moped and killing him. This story has been updated with additional details."

Police encountered the knife-wielding man in the store at the intersection of E. Tremont Ave. and Barkley Ave. in Throgs Neck, adjacent to the NYPD’s 45th Precinct stationhouse. About 2:10 p.m., a man entered the 7-Eleven and was reported by a store employee to have been walking back and forth from the front to the back of the store, police said. The employee left the store briefly to see a relative outside. When she returned, the suspicious-seeming man was behind the store’s counter with a store employee who appeared “very nervous,” said NYPD Assistant Chief Benjamin Gurley. The man “was removing products from behind the counter,” said Gurley, who is chief of NYPD Patrol Borough Bronx. The merchandise behind the counter was mostly cigarettes. The employee then walked to the 45th Precinct stationhouse next door and reported what she saw. About 2:30 p.m., two officers walked to the 7-Eleven, Gurley said. “They observed the male in the rear, by the coffee machines,” Gurley said. One of the officers ordered the man “to take his hands out of his sweatshirt pocket,” added Gurley. “That male then advanced on the officer, revealing a knife in his hand,” Gurley said. The man ignored the officer’s commands to drop the knife. “That officer then removed his firearm [and] attempted to retreat backwards. … He fired his firearm one time, striking the male in the torso,” Gurley said. One of the officers at the scene was an EMT, and had medical supplies with him, Gurley said. “Immediately they got on the ground and they attempted to save this person’s life,” Gurley said. Medics rushed the man to Jacobi Medical Center, where he was declared dead, police said. Officials said he was a 22-year-old Bronx resident. His name was not immediately released. Detectives filed in and out of the 7-Eleven on Saturday evening. The convenience store and a cell phone store in the same plaza were cordoned off by police tape. A bloody knife was on the floor near the store’s entrance on Saturday night. A police source said the man shot by police fell on the knife after he was hit. The incident was the second police-involved shooting reported in the past week. Police exchanged gunfire with a man early Monday in St. Albans, Queens. No one was reported hurt in that incident, and the armed suspect was taken into custody. Two police-involved shootings occurred in the city in mid-August. Officers wounded a man in Brooklyn on Aug. 17 who had ignored orders to pick up a gun from the ground. On Aug. 16, a man in the Bronx fired a shot at police officers who were chasing him on foot. Officers fired back. No one was hit in that incident."

North Korea invited visiting Chinese delegates and Russian artists to a paramilitary parade featuring rocket launchers pulled by trucks and tractors, state media said Saturday, in leader Kim Jong Un’s latest effort to display his relationship with Moscow and Beijing in the face of deepening confrontations with Washington.  The event in the capital, Pyongyang, which began Friday night to celebrate Saturday’s 75th anniversary of North Korea’s founding, came amid expectations that Kim will travel to Russia soon for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that could focus on North Korean arm sales to refill reserves drained by the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.  While China has sent a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu Guozhong to North Korea for the anniversary, Russia sent a military song- and-dance group.  Advertisement  South Korean media speculated that the lack of Russian government officials at the festivities in Pyongyang could be related to preparations for a summit between Kim and Putin, which Washington expects within the month. According to some U.S. reports, it could happen as early as next week.  Putin is expected to attend an international forum that runs from Sunday to Wednesday in Russia’s eastern city of Vladivostok, the site of his first summit with Kim in 2019 and now seen as a possible venue for their next meeting.  South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing Thursday that North Korea and Russia could also be arranging an unexpected “surprise” route for Kim’s visit to avoid potential venues reported by the media.  North Korea has not confirmed any plans for Kim to visit Russia.  “Whether or not a Putin-Kim summit soon follows, the United States is attempting to deter serious violations of international law by preemptively releasing intelligence,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.  The growing cooperation among China, Russia and North Korea, along with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s decision to skip the ongoing Group of 20 summit in India,give the appearance of a widening fissure in Asia’s geopolitical landscape, he said.  Advertisement  Still, a major Russia-North Korea arms deal, which would breach numerous international sanctions, should worry Beijing because “association with an emerging pariah state bloc could have negative repercussions for China’s globalized but struggling economy,” Easley said.  North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim received letters from Putin and Xi on the anniversary, in which both leaders said that their countries’ strengthening ties with North Korea would contribute to the region’s peace and stability.  Saturday’s parade was centered on paramilitary organizations and public security forces protecting Pyongyang, rather than the military units that handle his nuclear-capable weapons systems, which have been the focus of other parades this year.  Millions of North Koreans between ages 17 and 60 are listed as Worker-Peasant Red Guards, a national civil defense organization that could be loosely compared to military reserve forces of other countries. Saturday’s marches of the Red Guards included huge columns of motorcycles, antitank rockets towed by tractors and civilian-style trucks equipped with rocket launchers, according to Korean Central News Agency reporting.  Photos showed Kim smiling and talking with his young daughter, believed to be named Ju Ae, as they watched the parade from leather chairs in Kim’s balcony in Kim Il Sung Square, named after his state-founding grandfather.  Since November, Kim Jong Un has been bringing his daughter — believed to be about 10 years old — to major public events involving the country’s military. Analysts say Kim’s showcasing of his daughter is meant to send a statement to the world that he has no intention of voluntarily surrendering the nuclear weapons and missiles he sees as the strongest guarantee of his survival and the extension of his family’s dynastic rule.  State media did not mention whether Kim made a speech during the parade, indicating that he probably didn’t.  The Korean Central News Agency said Kim met with Liu and other Chinese delegates ahead of the parade, where they exchanged views on “further intensifying the multi-faceted coordination and cooperation” between the countries.  Tensions on the Korean peninsula are at their highest point in years, as the pace of the North’s missile tests and the United States’ joint military exercises with South Korea and Japan have intensified.  To counter the deepening security cooperation among Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, Kim has been trying to boost the visibility of his partnerships with Moscow and Beijing as he seeks to break out of diplomatic isolation and have North Korea be a part of a united front against the United States.  In July, Kim invited delegations led by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Li Hongzhong to a huge military parade in Pyongyang, where he rolled out his most powerful weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to target the U.S. mainland.  A day before the parade, Kim took Shoigu on a tour of a domestic arms exhibition, which demonstrated North Korea’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and added to suspicions Pyongyang was willing to supply arms to Russia.  In exchange for providing Russia with artillery shells and other ammunition, North Korea could seek badly needed energy and food aid and advanced weapons technologies, analysts say. There are concerns that potential Russian technology transfers would increase the threat posed by Kim’s growing arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles that are designed to target the United States and its Asian allies."

The deputy is John Rosello, 34, of Cazenovia. He has been a deputy since 2016.  Rosello fired three shots at a stolen Hyundai early Wednesday morning at the Midler Meadow Mobile Home Park. The shots hit and killed Dhal Apet, 17, and Lueth Mo, 15.  Sheriff Toby Shelley on Wednesday said the driver of the car — who has not been caught — tried to run over the deputy.  Shelley said that Rosello has not previously been involved in another police shooting as a deputy.  Rosello was placed on a mandatory 72-hour paid administrative leave following the fatal shooting. He remains on paid administrative leave, Thomas Newton, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, said Saturday.  After the initial news conference Wednesday, the sheriff’s office has refused to answer questions about the shooting. It has referred questions to the state Attorney General’s Office, which is investigating the shootings. An AG spokesperson has said the sheriff’s office is allowed to answer questions.  Laura Collins, president of the Onondaga County Deputy Sheriff’s Police Association, issued a statement Friday.  “Policing is dangerous, and we believe our member took the action he felt the situation warranted,” she said.  Referring to the investigations’ eventual findings, she said, “Until then, we respectfully encourage everyone to await the facts before jumping to conclusions.”  Rosello was investigating a reported burglary on East Molloy Road when a 911 caller reported suspicious activity at the mobile home park on North Midler Avenue.  When he responded, he knew that the cars seen near Danzig Street and Poznan Avenue matched the description of the vehicles used in the burglary, Shelley said Wednesday.  Shelley said the stolen Hyundai drove at Rosello while he was in a narrow space between his patrol vehicle and a workbench and could not get out of the way. That led him to fire at the car, Shelley said.  The car fled and ended up crashing on Mooney Avenue in Syracuse where one teen was found dead and the other dying. The driver fled the scene.  Rosello provided a statement to the sheriff’s administration, Newton said Wednesday. It is unclear if Rosello has spoken to the Attorney General’s Office.  The sheriff’s office named Rosello employee of the month for April 2021 and June 2022.  Rosello’s base salary is $70,390. In 2022, he made $90,894, according to state payroll records.

In one of his most visible public appearances since his country was thrown into chaos over his controversial pension reforms and racially-inspired riots over a police shooting of an Algerian heritage teenager, President Macron did not receive a warm welcome from the French people at the Stade de Frace at the Rugby World Cup.  While the opening ceremony saw a myriad of French celebrities embraced by the crowd, this was not the case for the embattled globalist leader, whose appearance at the match sparked a wave of boos from the stands.  Appearing before a mock Eiffel Tower, Macron — who once promised to govern the French Republic like the Roman god Jupiter — appeared to be surprised by the backlash from the public.  Macron booed by an entire stadium. pic.twitter.com/ACCSesqGLt — Darren Grimes (@darrengrimes_) September 8, 2023  Although Mr Macron secured reelection last year, his popularity among the French people has cratered since then, with the country suffering under a cost of living crisis as a result of the Chinese coronavirus lockdowns and the war in Ukraine.  In what was seen as a slap in the face to the working class during a period of hardship, Macron’s government controversially pushed through a raise to the pension age in the National Assembly without a vote to supposedly sure up public finances. This sparked months of protests, strikes and riots throughout the country.  While Macron had begged the public to give him 100 days to turn the country around, “100 days of anger” was promised in return. Although the protests over the pension reform faded, they were soon replaced by race riots following the killing of an Algerian heritage teenager in a Paris suburb.  In response to the deep anger against his government, Macron has opted to minimise opportunities for the public to interact with him. For example, during the annual ceremony for Victory in Europe Day to mark the official end of World War II in May, Macron was forced to drive down a nearly empty Champs-Elysées with the public being barred from the famed avenue for fear of protests against the president.

NYPD officer fatally shoots suspected knife-wielding shoplifter in the Bronx,9/9/23,2023-09-10T02:46:17Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/09/09/nypd-shoots-kills-suspected-shoplifter-in-the-bronx/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230910024617id_/https://nypost.com/2023/09/09/nypd-shoots-kills-suspected-shoplifter-in-the-bronx/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230910024617/https://nypost.com/2023/09/09/nypd-shoots-kills-suspected-shoplifter-in-the-bronx/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8wOS8wOS9ueXBkLXNob290cy1raWxscy1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtc2hvcGxpZnRlci1pbi10aGUtYnJvbng~,"An NYPD officer shot and killed a knife-wielding shoplifter in the Bronx on Saturday afternoon, police and sources said. The deadly episode â which unfolded shortly after 2:30 p.m. in a 7-Eleven at East Tremont and Barkley avenues inÂ Throgs NeckÂ â may have started as an argument with a store clerk over a cigarette, or a âloosie,â sources said. The 22-year-old — who sources said had a lengthy police record — entered the store around 2:10 p.m. and was suspiciously walking around with a knife for 20 minutes and taking products off the counters, Deputy Chief Benjamin Gurley told reporters at a press conference. One of the two employees of the store went outside to meet with a relative, and when he returned, âthe male was then observed behind the counter with another employee and that employee looked very nervous,â Gurley said. The employee whoâd gone outside then immediately went to the 45th precinct station house and told security officers what was happening. Two officers then walked over to the store with the employee, and saw the suspect in the rear of the shop near the coffee machines. As the officers approached him, one officer gave the suspect several verbal commands to take his hounds out of his sweatshirt pockets, police said. Without saying a word, the man revealed a knife and charged at the officer,Â Gurley said.Â The officer drew his gun while retreating and shot the suspect in the torso a single time near the entrance of the store, police and sources said. The officers, one of whom is a trained EMT, provided aid to the man. He was pronounced dead at Jacobi Hospital at 3:14 p.m. The two officers were also taken to an area hospital. Cops recovered the blade at the scene, Gurley said, and showed reporters a photo of the large knife at the press conference. The suspect, whose name was not released pending family notification of his death, had been arrested seven times before â mostly for theft â and was on probation at the time of the incident, source said. Many people stopped by the crime scene on Saturday evening, with some remarking how the shooting happened so close to a police precinct. Noel Rivera, who lives down the block from the 7-Eleven, said he thinks the incident is a result of the police âlosing their gripâ on the city, emboldening criminals. âWhen you take authority from the police, people become more daring. Right now police are not entitled to do anything. Their hands are tied. So this is what you get. I spend a lot of money on taxes, I want them to protect me,â he told The Post. Another local resident, Colleen K., said she shops at the store often and hoped that the employees were okay. âI don’t believe in violence. But you know what if he was going to take another life, no. The cops did the right thing,â she said. âThe areaâs bad, the people are just brave, itâs sad, very sad.âÂ The shooting is the latest of police-involved shootings in the city in the two months. On Labor Day, a manÂ randomly shotÂ at two police officers on patrol in Queens, prompting them to fire back around 3:20 a.m.. Fortunately, nobody was injured and a 35-year-old man was taken into custody. PoliceÂ shot and woundedÂ a 17-year-old boy after he allegedly picked up a gun during a foot chase in Brooklyn on Aug. 17."

(THE CONVERSATION) After weeks of public pressure, Philadelphia police on Sept. 8, 2023, released body camera footage capturing the fatal shooting of 27-year-old Eddie Irizarry by police in August. The Conversation spoke to Jordan M. Hyatt, associate professor of criminology and justice studies and the director of the Center for Public Policy at Philadelphia’s Drexel University, to explain the rules controlling when the public gets to see body cam footage – and how Philadelphia’s legal framework compares to other places in the U.S. Advertisement Article continues below this ad How long have Philadelphia police been using body cams? The department began using what are more formally known as “body-worn cameras” as part of a pilot program in 2014 – about seven years after the cameras first became availablein the U.K. However, their use in Philadelphia did not become widespread until 2017. Even now, only about 68% of all officers wear one, according to numbers provided by the Philadelphia police. Who decides when this video is made public? The district attorney’s office has the final say regarding any video release while there is an active, potentially criminal investigation. Officer Mark Dial surrendered to police on Sept. 8 and faces murder and other charges in the shooting. Earlier, the police commissioner had indicated her intent to fire him for insubordination after a 30-day suspension. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Videos of police encounters with the public are not considered public records at the state level. A change in Pennsylvania law passed in 2017 prevents the release of these recordings under right-to-know processes. In deciding to release footage, the Philadelphia police and district attorney try to balance state and federal rules with the wishes of the victim and their family, the need to preserve the integrity of videos as evidence in a criminal trial, ongoing investigations and public safety concerns. Can a resident of Philadelphia ask for video to be released? Yes, but the process can be slow and is rarely successful. A detailed request must be submitted within 60 days of the incident either in person or by certified mail. The requesting party must also pay the costs associated with the request. Advertisement Article continues below this ad State laws and local regulations require the law enforcement agency to first decide if a video can be released and provide an explanation for any denial. Decisions can be appealed to the Court of Common Pleas – a judicial process that can take quite some additional time. That is not to say that body camera footage is never released, but it is exceedingly uncommon across Pennsylvania. The Irizarry video is only the second such video released in Philadelphia. The first video released showed the police-shooting death of Walter Wallace Jr.in 2020. That video also came out after an intense public outcry. Why has the Irizarry case drawn so much attention? Advertisement Article continues below this ad Initially, the Philadelphia police declined to release the Irizarry footage, citing the ongoing investigation. And, at first, District Attorney Larry Krasner agreed to withhold it. But a home security system also captured video of the incident, and the homeowner released it to the Irizarry family’s attorney about a week after the shooting. It seems to show Dial opening fire almost immediately after arriving at the scene. Shortly after this third-party video came out, and amid increasingly visible protests, Krasner allowed Irizarry’s family to view the official footage and promised to release it to the public. On Sept. 8, Krasner made good on that promise. Is Philadelphia’s record for releasing footage unusual? Advertisement Article continues below this ad The approach in both Philadelphia and Pennsylvania is fairly common. A 2018 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum found that 17% of police departments never release videos. Like Philadelphia, nearly 80% can withhold them if they will be used as evidence or in a personnel matter. Philadelphia’s approach is broadly similar to other large cities, including New York and Washington, D.C. Unlike jurisdictions in Pennsylvania, however, these cities allow for the online submission of requests to view video footage under relevant open records laws, potentially speeding up the process. Why don’t all of the city’s police wear body cameras? Advertisement Article continues below this ad The program is widespread; however, cameras have not yet been issued to the 15th district, highway, traffic, airport, narcotics strike force, neighborhood services and SWAT teams, according to the police department. Additionally, cameras are worn only by uniformed officers; undercover officers, for example, are exempt. One of the biggest limitations to the adoption of body cameras nationwide has been the cost, which includes training, equipment and data storage. In Philadelphia, the program has cost US$20 million over the past decade, according to Axios. Despite the large price tag, some research suggests that every $1 spent on body-worn cameras results in about $5 of savings by cutting down on complaints, including those that lead to lawsuits from citizens. Zooming out, the use of body cameras has become commonplace in the U.S., with 80% of large police departments adopting their use by 2018. While the associated costs are a significant hurdle, especially for smaller municipalities, federal support has increased. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Advocates hoped body cameras would reduce violence by creating more transparency about police interactions with the public. Have they had that effect? A review of all the rigorous, available research on the topic in 2020 found that body-worn cameras were associated with decreases in the number of citizen complaints and an increase in the quality of criminal investigations. Research findings on the effects on the use of force, arrests and assaults are more mixed, making drawing broad conclusions difficult. In Philadelphia, recent studies suggest that body cameras can reframe the role of police, emphasizing their position as community guardians. Additional, high-quality research suggests that Philadelphia police officers wearing cameras had about 38% less use-of-force incidents and made 39% fewer arrests compared to officers not wearing cameras. Earlier studies in the city, however, found that body cameras had no effect on arrest rates or compliance but did reduce complaints. It remains an open question whether opening up public access to the video captured by these cameras would increase positive outcomes.

He didn’t even hear the gunshots before finding himself lying on the ground and bleeding.  “I just felt getting hit, and getting knocked down,” Sombat Mifkovic recalled from the witness stand.“I called out to my partner and he was not responsive.”  The officer’s words highlighted the opening day of testimony in the trial of Robert Alvin Justus Jr., a 33-year-old Millbrae man accused of helping in the shooting of Mifkovic and the assassination of another Federal Protective Services security officer. Authorities suspect it was all inspired by the far-right, anti-government Boogaloo movement, whose members are known to post online about an impending start of a second American Civil War.  Justus faces federal charges of aiding and abetting first-degree murder, as well as aiding and abetting attempted murder. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.  Prosecutors allege Justus joined forces with another Bay Area man, Steven Carrillo, to carry out the drive-by shooting that left 53-year-old Federal Protective Services Officer Dave “Patrick” Underwood dead and Mifkovic severely wounded.  FBI agents suspect Carrillo and Justus traveled to Oakland with the sole intention of finding and killing police officers. In an interview with the agency, however, Justus claimed that he simply planned to attend the protest, and that Carrillo strong-armed him into the murder plot.  Carrillo was later apprehended in Santa Cruz County, where authorities say he ambushed police officers there and killed Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller following the Underwood killing. He pleaded guilty to murdering Underwood and Gutzwiller and was sentenced in June 2022 to 41 years in prison.  The deadly drive-by shooting happened during the height of social justice protests and riots that followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minnesota police officer in late May 2020. Security officials at the Oakland federal building had beefed up security in anticipation of protests turning chaotic that night – leading several officers to patrol the grounds in pairs.  Mifkovic recalled being just 15 minutes from being relieved by other officers at his post when, seemingly out of nowhere, bullets started flying at the guard tower outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building.  He said the attack happened so quickly that he didn’t see who opened fire, or from where.  “When I was knocked down, I was on my back, looking up,” Mifkovic said. “And I just saw the bullets hitting the guard shack glass.”  Mifkovic, who walked to the witness stand with a noticeable limp and cane, said he was left permanently disabled by the attack after being shot in his left shoulder, left femur, chin and right arm.  After being shot, Mifkovic said he immediately pointed his gun at the first person he could see and ordered them to raise their hands, in case that person was the shooter.  Authorities soon suspected that someone in a white van that drove by the guard shack carried out the attack. A white van had already drawn the suspicions of officers at the federal building 20 or 30 minutes beforehand, when a driver appeared to stop in front of the building and stare at officers, according to testimony from Charles Clemons, a Federal Protective Service investigator who also was on patrol elsewhere at the federal building that night.  Justus, who was dressed in a white button-up shirt with a long brown ponytail, showed little emotion throughout the hearing – often lowering his head onto his folded hands as witnesses testified about the shooting.  In the days after the attack, Justus told FBI investigators that he was an unwilling participant in the deadly shooting – having been unwittingly wrangled into the shooting plot and held against his will throughout the attack, according to court documents.  Justus recalled planning to catch a ride to the protests with Carrillo and – upon meeting at the San Leandro BART parking lot – watching in dismay as the situation took a turn for the worse, court documents show. Justus told investigators that Carrillo pulled back a homemade curtain inside the van to reveal body armor, multiple firearms and Molotov cocktails. Moments later, Carrillo allegedly announced plans to kill an AC Transit bus driver approaching their van.  “I don’t like this, I am not cool with this,” Justus said he told Carrillo, according to a transcript of his interview with FBI special agents in 2020. By his telling, the remark prompted Carrillo to pull an AR-15 rifle at Justus while demanding to know if he was “a cop or a rat.”  The alleged threat left him feeling “that I am going to f—ing die,” Justus told investigators.  Justus previously told federal investigators that he met Carrillo through a Facebook group for Boogaloo followers called “/K/alifornia Kommando,” which has since been shut down.  The two appeared to have little in common besides their interest in the Boogaloo movement – a loosely-based anti-government movement whose followers were spotted at the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on Capitol Hill, while being linked to numerous other acts of violence across the country.  Just hours into testimony, the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, voiced concerns about having already dismissed two jurors so early in the proceedings.  One juror was dismissed after reporting feeling ill. Another was dismissed Friday morning after alerting the judge that he had forgotten to mention during jury selection that he had actually driven near the scene of the shooting and had his car nearly overtaken by a mob of protesters that night while driving home.  Only two alternatives remain for the trial, which is expected to last two weeks.  “The sentence in this case is mandatory life – if it takes two more weeks, it takes two more weeks,” Gonzalez Rogers said."

Ronnell Spencer, charged in a deadly 2022 San Jose shooting, was scheduled to face jurors for the first time in a San Jose courtroom Thursday morning when, without warning, he started punching a Santa Clara County deputy public defender who was representing him, sources familiar with the incident told this news organization.  Court bailiffs — who are county sheriff’s deputies — soon intervened to subdue Spencer, 33, and pull the attorney away from the fray, sources said.  The attorney who was attacked was not seriously injured, sources said; this news organization is withholding the attorney’s name because the attorney is the victim of an alleged crime. The county Public Defender’s Office declined to comment on the reported assault.  The immediate impact on the trial is a change in legal representation for Spencer: The county public defender’s office declared a conflict as a result of the encounter, and the Alternate Defender’s Office was appointed at a Friday hearing to step in and represent in front of Judge Audra Ibarra.  The next court date is set for Oct. 2.  It had not been determined Friday whether Spencer would face new prosecution based on the attack. In a statement, the county District Attorney’s Office said, “The incident has been investigated by the (sheriff’s office) and the office will make a charging decision when their reports are submitted for review.”  Spencer was not restrained at the time of the reported assault, which is customary for defendants at trial and is based on the premise that being seen in jail uniforms, or handcuffs or shackles, risks prejudicing a jury. The county Superior Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether any security practices for Spencer would change going forward.  Spencer, a Chicago resident, has been in jail custody for over a year in connection with the fatal shooting of 27-year-old Antioch resident Jacqui Amir Biggins in the early morning hours of March 27, 2022 near Fourth and San Carlos streets across from San Jose State University.  The shooting gained additional notoriety because it happened near the site of a controversial San Jose police shooting that unfolded less than an hour later. In that incident, police rushed to a nearby taqueria after fleeing patrons described a fight and a gun sighting, and soon after, an officer shot and wounded Oakland resident K’aun Green as he emerged from the restaurant holding a handgun above his head.  Green and his attorneys contend he was shot after he and a friend disarmed a man during a brawl that Green did not instigate, and they are suing the city and police department."

Young, who was suspected of shoplifting, was killed by a Blendon Township police officer who fired a single bullet into her windshield after she refused to leave her car and it started rolling toward him. Her unborn daughter, due in November, did not survive. Young's family members held a funeral for her on Thursday. They have called for the officer, whose name has not been released, to be fired and charged in her death. Earlier this week, police released bodycam footage showing the officer firing the gun.

Walton told The Associated Press on Friday that while the witness ended up being mistaken, it does not change the fact that Young was killed for an alleged minor offense. “I see nothing but more evidence that a murder occurred, more evidence of the policy violations that occurred, and more reason why this officer should be terminated and indicted for murder,” Walton said.

Andre Smith was wounded outside a residence in the 2600 block of Dover Avenue, the San Pablo Police Department said. He remained hospitalized in critical condition by Saturday afternoon.  Officers were initially called to the home around 1:40 p.m. to assist with a mental health evaluation, according to police. A woman told a 911 dispatcher her husband was showing signs of schizophrenia.  When officers arrived at the residence, Smith locked himself inside a room and refused to talk to them, police said. He did not live at the home, but he was not acting violent at the time and his wife agreed to call police if he exited and needed help.  Smith’s wife called 911 around 2:50 p.m. and asked officers to return to the residence because he was harassing her, according to police. He was outside now and she did not want him to return.  The dispatcher overheard Smith in the background say he would “kill police officers and make them kill him,” police said.  Officers arrived to find Smith in the front yard. Police said he did not listen to their orders and concealed himself in the side yard. At one point, he reportedly threw pieces of brick at the officers.  In an effort to subdue Smith, officers fired Tasers and bean bag rounds at him, but they were not effective. He then grabbed a folding chair, which he used as a shield, and charged at officers with a three-foot-long metal pole, according to police.  Smith swung the pole at an officer, who ducked to avoid being hit, police said. Another officer fired one round from his service weapon, hitting Smith in the upper right leg.  Smith was then arrested and taken to a hospital.  The Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office is leading the investigation into the shooting, according to police. The officers involved in the incident will be placed on paid administrative leave per county policy.  Anyone with information related to the case can contact the police department’s investigations division at 510-215-3150.  This is a developing story. Check back for updates."

The 21-year-old assailant tried to corner three cops inside the 540 Main St. elevator on Aug. 5 and showed no signs of stopping when they displayed their weapons. The disturbing footage shows the man storming toward one female officer, who pushed a Taser into his chest as a warning sign but ultimately didn’t discharge the weapon. The two colleagues that flanked her quickly pulled their triggers, blasting the young man with more than a dozen rounds, and the video shows he initially survived and continued waving the knife as he lay on the floor. “Drop the knife!” officers can be heard screaming. The man was later taken by EMS to a local hospital where he died from his wounds. His identity has not yet been released. The fatal encounter unfolded within a matter of seconds, according to the video, which was released as part of the state Attorney General’s investigation into the police-involved shooting. The officers had been inside the building after receiving multiple 911 calls from the man’s relatives who said he was threatening them with a knife. Three had just entered one of the elevators and were preparing to ride it to the man’s floor, while two others were trying to prop open the lobby door with fliers in anticipation of backup. A sixth cop watching his colleagues work on the door had his back turned when a second elevator came down and the assailant flew out with the knife raised. The bodycam shows the maniac trying to slash the unsuspecting cop before turning toward the three who were cornered in the elevator. Multiple people can be heard screaming nonsensically, though none clearly shouted warnings at the unhinged man until after he was peppered with bullets. Witnesses said the succession of shots was so quick that they assumed fireworks had gone off in the quiet neighborhood. The suspectâs relative told police the man was off his medication and under the influence of marijuana, Deputy Chief Christine Bastedenbeck told reporters the night of the incident. The Attorney General’s investigation into the deadly shooting is still ongoing."

Young, who was suspected of shoplifting, was killed by a Blendon Township police officer who fired a single bullet into her windshield after she refused to leave her car and it started rolling toward him. Her unborn daughter, due in November, did not survive. Young's family members held a funeral for her on Thursday. They have called for the officer, whose name has not been released, to be fired and charged in her death. Earlier this week, police released bodycam footage showing the officer firing the gun. After viewing the footage, the family released a statement calling the officer's actions a âgross misuse of power and authority,"" especially given that Young had been accused of a relatively minor crime. The additional security footage made public on Friday shows Young and two other women walking around the liquor department of the Columbus-area store. Young can be seen putting multiple bottles of alcohol into her purse and a tote bag while out of sight of the cash register. She and the two other women then leave without paying. Sean Walton, the Young family's attorney, said earlier this week that his law firm had found a witness who stated that Young put down the bottles before leaving the store, and therefore had committed no crime. Walton told The Associated Press on Friday that while the witness ended up being mistaken, it does not change the fact that Young was killed for an alleged minor offense. âI see nothing but more evidence that a murder occurred, more evidence of the policy violations that occurred, and more reason why this officer should be terminated and indicted for murder,â Walton said. The additional bodycam footage also shows police officers quickly rendering medical aid to Young after she is shot. They break the window of her car, which has rolled into the brick wall of the supermarket, and pull her from the vehicle. The tote bag full of liquor is visible as they drag her from the car. Then, following police procedure, they handcuff her as they try to stanch her bleeding gunshot wound. Young can be heard moaning before she loses consciousness. Walton said he understands the police policy of handcuffing a suspect for the officers' own safety, but he said the visibly pregnant and wounded Young posed no threat to them. âThe handcuffing is inhumane,"" he said. Both officers, with the help of an emergency room doctor who happened to be in the parking lot, continue medical aid until paramedics arrive. The officer who shot her can be heard saying multiple times that Young tried to run him over, and the other officer responds, âI know.â Young's family has not viewed the newest bodycam footage, and Walton said he advised them not to do so because of its graphic nature. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford has said that Ohio law prohibits the release of the officers' identities because they are being treated as assault victims. One of the officers' arms was still in the door of Young's car when it started moving and the other officer was still standing in front of the vehicle, he said."

The coastal agents who just do not think of Chicago as a “viable market” for their clients. The nationally-renowned scholar who doesn’t see the point of adding a Chicago academic to a panel discussion. There’s the audiences who will not venture north of Madison. Or drive south of Roosevelt. You are a Midwestern organization with a roughly $4 million annual budget, but you are still a nonprofit and some of those big names you want to book insist on quite the entourages. Also, actors, being on strike at the moment, will not discuss on stage, you know, the things we know them from. Should you worry that Trump-centric comedian Sarah Cooper (Oct. 14) is scheduled so close to Fox News’s Bret Baier (Oct. 14)? Will they run into one other? You want a smart festival addressing social issues of the day — this year, it’s the rise of AI and the impact of climate change — but you might need to land the Fonz (Henry Winkler, Nov. 4) to help subsidize a panel on the links between Chicago public art and environmental justice (Oct. 14). Oh, the agita. You thought planning a dinner party was hard? Try planning one that lasts 60 days and seats Sonic Youth’s noise merchant Thurston Moore (Nov. 1) and provocative essayist Roxanne Gay (Nov. 5) alongside a fair number of elderly attendees. The Chicago Humanities Festival was initially a one-day fall thing. It’s now in its 34th year and, at its most sprawling, once offered about 130 events a year. These days, the festival is year-round and puts on roughly 100 events. Like other cultural institutions, it’s also smaller. Attendance is about 50,000, closer to its post-COVID 2019 number, said Phillip Bahar, executive director. But like other cultural groups reliant on constituencies, membership (its key financial support) has fallen — Bahar expects membership to be 35% lower than pre-COVID’s 2,500 members. The good news is, that the audience is younger than a decade ago, when the festival’s membership rolls, like other Chicago theater companies and musical arts organizations, looked overly gray. If Lauren Pacheco has her way, that change will continue. “If we’re feeling different this year, if we’re visibly looking different, that’s because we are moving in a different direction,” said Pacheco, now in her second year as co-creative director with Michael Green. “Michael and I have a vision and we’re still getting to know each other and find our alignments, and like other cultural organizations, we recognize a need to cultivate a younger audience, and a more diverse audience, and also addressing the relevant issues. What does that mean in the long haul here? I think it means we’re going to be a bit playful — experimental.” And, for lack of a better word, more Chicago. Variety-wise, this year’s festival resembles past festivals. You get A-list cultural voices: Bob Odenkirk and daughter Erin discussing their new book (Oct. 14); a tribute to Philip Glass (Nov. 5); author Zadie Smith (Sept. 19); poet Tracy K. Smith (Nov. 5). And a handful of A-list political names: Rachel Maddow (Oct. 19), former Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger interviewed by journalist (and Chicago native) Jonathan Alter (Nov. 5). Plenty of national thought leaders: Matthew Desmond on poverty (Oct. 14); Walter Isaacson on Elon Musk (Oct. 14); Naomi Klein on our online hall of mirrors (Sept. 19); David Brooks on the importance of being seen (Nov. 5). And one or two left field surprises: Controversial Harvard physicist Avi Loeb on the existence of aliens (Nov. 5); Illinois first lady MK Pritzker on renovating the Governor’s Mansion (Oct. 14). There are deep-dive chats on AI: AI and creativity (Oct. 18), AI and criminal justice (Nov. 5). And climate change — climate change and morality (Oct. 21), climate change and Chicago (Nov. 5). But then, there’s Sebastian Hidalgo (Oct. 18), the native Pilsen photographer who made a name depicting the effects of gentrification; Chicago chef Rick Bayless (with San Francisco chef Anna Voloshyna) on Ukrainian food (Oct. 14); Chicago fashion designer Chelsey Carter (Oct. 18); South Side police shootings and the making of film that uses police bodycam footage (Nov. 5). “We want to bring the best scholars from across the country,” Pacheco said, “but at the same time we are in this amazing city and we need to figure out how to better leverage what it offers.” One way to do this, said co-creative director Green, is put more attention on live performance and experiential events — such as Chicago-based Fulcrum Point New Music Project performing minimalist composer Le Monte Young (Nov. 16). “That, alongside the Philip Glass event, for instance, you get kind of this miniseries of informal learning on minimalism.” About a year and a half ago, Green and Pacheco replaced Alison Cuddy as creative director. Green was a public events programmer at the Museum of Contemporary Art and veteran of the education department at the Art Institute of Chicago; Pacheco was a longtime arts administrator and grassroots organizer, at, among other places, Indiana University and University of Chicago. A couple of autumns later, the Humanities Festival will still unfold in the usual places — the Loop, Hyde Park, Evanston. But Green and Pacheco plan to expand it routinely into far more places around the city. Last spring, for instance, they programmed a day of events at the Epiphany Center for the Arts on the West Side that included acclaimed authors Brandon Taylor and Aleksandar Hemon. Pacheco, citing census data and the growth of Latino populations across Chicago, is now eyeing events on the Far Southwest Side as well as “nontraditional venues” around Little Village and outdoors. Her dream, she said, would be a Humanities Festival at Guaranteed Rate Field, playing a broader audience. “One day, if we keep this excitement going, I hope, you’ll see a few low riders pulling up to something at the Chicago Humanities Festival.” The Chicago Humanities Festival’s Fall Festival runs Sept. 17 to Nov. 15 at various venues; for schedule and more information at www.chicagohumanities.org cborrelli@chicagotribune.com"

The deadly shooting came after deputies stopped two cars in DeWitt early Wednesday while investigating car thefts and at least two overnight smoke-shop burglaries, Onondaga County Sheriff Toby Shelley told a press conference.  “One of the vehicles flees. The other vehicle … attempts to run our deputy over,” the sheriff said, saying it was going “fast enough to run someone over and kill them.”  “He fires three shots,” he said of the deputy, who has not been identified.  “He had nowhere to flee to,” the sheriff said. “This whole thing happened in seconds. He had no options.”  The car was driven away but crashed nearby, the sheriff said. A sergeant responding to the crash found one of the teens dead and “performed life-saving measures with negative results” on the other occupant, Shelley said.  4 Onondaga County Sheriff Toby Shelley announced Wednesday that a deputy fatally shot two teenagers. WTVH  Officials did not identify the victims beyond saying they were teenagers.  Sources told Syracuse.com they were 15 and 17 years old.  A third suspect in the car fled, as did those in the other car stopped before the shooting.  A witness filmed the shooting, the sheriff said, without making the footage public.  Shelley said the teenagers were involved in a crime spree that began around 9 p.m. Tuesday, when a Kia and a Hyundai were stolen in Syracuse. The stolen vehicles were connected to a burglary at the OQ Smokeline in Onondaga around 4 a.m., Shelley said.  4 Onondaga sheriff’s deputies in a residential neighborhood following the shooting. WTVH  Officers found the side door of the store smashed, Syracuse.com reports, and surveillance footage showed two groups arriving in a dark van and a white sedan.  They entered through the smashed door, police said, and stole an unspecified number of items from the store before fleeing.  That same group was also involved in similar incidents later in the morning in Onondaga County, Shelley said, when the vehicles were spotted in a burglary at a smoke shop on East Molloy Road in DeWitt.  The deputy who shot the teens had been investigating that burglary, Shelley said, when someone called 911 to report suspicious activity at the nearby Midler Meadows mobile home park.  4 The deputy, who has not been identified, fired three times after the car’s occupants allegedly tried to run him over. WTVH  The 6:18 a.m. caller reported seeing three or four men wearing dark clothing and moving items between a sedan and a dark minivan.  The deputy responded to the mobile home park, realizing the vehicles the caller mentioned matched the description of those seen on video from the smoke shop burglary.  The deadly shooting was the “tragic” result of a “chain of events over 10 hours,” said the sheriff, who said he has been in contact with the victims’ families.  4 The shooting is being investigated by the New York state Attorney General’s Office. WTVH  His office is also in contact with the District Attorney’s Office and the New York state Attorney General’s Office, which is required by law to investigate any deaths caused by police officers in the state.  Letitia James’ office confirmed later in the day that it was doing a “preliminary assessment” of the fatal shooting.  The deputy is on 72-hour paid administrative leave, standing protocol for officer-involved shootings."

Hayward police fatally shoot man who witnesses say brandished a gun,9/7/23,2023-09-08T02:43:36Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/07/person-dead-after-being-shot-by-hayward-police/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230908024336id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/07/person-dead-after-being-shot-by-hayward-police/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230908024336/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/07/person-dead-after-being-shot-by-hayward-police/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzA5LzA3L3BlcnNvbi1kZWFkLWFmdGVyLWJlaW5nLXNob3QtYnktaGF5d2FyZC1wb2xpY2U~,"HAYWARD — A man died Wednesday night after being shot by Hayward police officers, authorities said Thursday.  Hayward police acting Chief Bryan Matthews said during a Thursday-afternoon news conference that the shooting happened about 10 p.m. Officers had been called about 20 minutes earlier to the 2200 block of City Center Drive, where police were told a man pulled a gun on two women who were in a vehicle.  Authorities did not identify the man immediately, citing the investigation. Matthews said three officers were involved in the incident and that two fired their guns. He did not identify them. All of the officers’ body-worn cameras were turned on at the time of the shooting, he said.  The officers who both fired their guns have about five years’ experience in the department, Matthews said. They were placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy following a police shooting.  According to Matthews, witnesses told police that a man pointed a gun at them and then left the area. Police began to search for the man and later encountered someone matching the witnesses’ description, Matthews said.  The officers tried to talk to the man, but Matthews said he wasn’t cooperative and walked away. At least one witness that spoke to police saw the man point a gun at officers just before the shooting, he said.  The man died after being rushed to a hospital.  “One of the things that we don’t have is the statement of any of the involved officers at this point,” said Matthews, adding that those interviews “are in the process of being scheduled,” and that “we’re hoping to have that information to be able to share soon.”  Police recovered a BB gun at the scene that matched the description of the one provided by witnesses, Matthews said.  “Any loss of life is tragic and last night’s incident is no exception,” Matthews said. “My heart goes out to the decedent and those involved, including the involved Hayward employees.”  Police notified the California Department of Justice; Matthews said the agency is not involved in the investigation at this point. The state’s DOJ investigates any police shooting in which the person is not armed with a weapon considered to be potentially lethal.  However, as is routine in such situations, the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the shooting. The city also plans to have a Chicago-based firm conduct a separate review over whether the officers followed the department’s policies.  The last time Hayward police shot a person was in October 2022.  This is a developing report. Check back for updates."

Police said another officer shot at the vehicle being driven by suspect Alex Husson, 33, of Ellicott City, Maryland, but didnât hit the accused thief with gunfire. Mr. Husson is facing an attempted first-degree murder charge, on top of other possible charges, for the incident that happened Tuesday morning at a 7-Eleven in the southwestern part of the city, according to police. Acting Police Commissioner Richard Worley said two officers were hospitalized following the confrontation â one with a minor hand injury, the other with chest pains.Â Detectives first observed a man stealing items from the convenience store around 11:20 a.m.Â When officers approached the suspect, he fled and got inside a black SUV, which Mr. Husson is accused of using to assault the police. Commissioner Worley said police were in the area investigating a string of burglaries in recent weeks at Wilkens Plaza Shopping Center, where the 7-Eleven is located. The 7-Eleven has 10 reported instances of shoplifting, according to police. • Matt Delaney can be reached at mdelaney@washingtontimes.com. Copyright © 2023 The Washington Times, LLC.

Partner?” the officer yells. “Partner, you OK?”  The other officer motions that he has not been shot, but he is clearly upset and slouches to the floor.  The shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. Aug. 11 after officers were called to the 1100 block of West 111th Street. Police say Gordon-Hay had been arguing with a man and had pulled a gun.  When officers arrive, Gordon-Hay runs into a home and tries to close the door, according to video from the officers’ body-worn cameras. They knock Gordon-Hay to the floor and yell, “Put your hands up! Put your hands up!”  Gordon-Hay pushes them out the door, but the officers force their way back in as Gordon-Hay says, “I’ll shoot you, I’ll shoot you,” the video shows.  The officers struggle with him on the floor, pulling down a curtain. “Get the gun in his hand,” one of the officers says.  Someone else in the home yells, “Let the gun go before they kill your ass.”  The officers are heard yelling “let it go” several times as Gordon-Hay repeatedly says “kill me.”  Two shots are heard, and Gordon-Hay is seen slumped on the floor, blood pooling around his head.  One of the officers backs away, sits down on the floor, then rushes out to a squad car to get a first aid kit. Later, the officer is seen pacing back and forth in the front yard, kicking the door of the car closed and placing his palms on the hood while breathing hard.  “Catch your breath, you’re good,” an officer tells him.  When a supervisor arrives, one of the officers tells him, “He fired first. He fired, and I fired.”  The video was released by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which said it is continuing to investigate the shooting.  It asked anyone with information or video to call 312-746-3609 or visit ChicagoCOPA.org."

The video identified the man as Benjamin Annaboli, 37. Significant Event Briefing: Officer-Involved Shooting, August 17, 2023 The following Video provides a summary of releasable facts, circumstances, and information currently known to investigators regarding an officer-involved shooting in Colorado Springs on August 17, 2023. — Colorado Springs Police Department (@CSPDPIO) September 6, 2023 U.S. Marshals and parole officers observed him on Aug. 17 in the parking lot of a hotel at 1700 Aeroplaza Drive and identified him as a “violent offender with several outstanding arrest warrants for felony criminal offenses” when they requested assistance from CSPD’s Tactical Enforcement Unit, Rosenoff said. Tactical enforcement officers went to the hotel and attempted to arrest Annaboli, but he ran away on foot toward the hotel “while holding a handgun in each of his hands,” Rosenoff said. Annaboli refused multiple officers’ commands to drop the guns, Rosenoff said, and pointed one at an officer. A canine officer then released his canine to try and stop him, but Annaboli kept running and tried to fight the dog off while it bit him. Two officers then shot Annaboli, and he fell to the ground. Edited body-worn camera footage released with the briefing video shows an officer stepping out of his police vehicle with a rifle and shooting at Annaboli multiple times. Drone footage shows the canine officer shooting Annaboli with his handgun as Annaboli approaches the hotel’s front door while bystanders run away from the area. The two officers were identified as Brian Kelly, the canine handler who is part of the specialized enforcement division and has been with the CSPD for 22 years, and Matthew Waters, a specialized enforcement division officer with the CSPD for 11 years. The officers found one of the handguns on the ground next to him and the other still in Annaboli’s hand. The body-worn camera footage also shows multiple officers attempting to apply tourniquets and first aid to Annaboli’s injuries. Annaboli was then taken to a hospital where he died. The briefing video did not specify when Annaboli died, but a CSPD spokesperson said in an email Annaboli died the same day, Aug. 17. The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the shooting and will send the results of the investigation to the Fourth Judicial District’s District Attorney’s Office.

The officer, Christopher Schurr, 32, awaits trial charged with second-degree murder in Lyoyaâs April 4, 2022, death. His attorneys filed an interlocutory appeal asking the state Court of Appeals to find that lower courts erred in ordering Schurr to stand trial. An appellate panel - Kathleen Feeney, Colleen OâBrien and Brock Swartzle â heard arguments Wednesday, Sept. 6, in the highly publicized, controversial killing. Video showed Lyoya on the ground when he was shot in the back of his head. Schurr and his supporters, some wearing blue shirts, and Lyoya family members and supporters, packed the courtroom. Outside, Lyoya supporters held signs, including, âJustice 4 Patrick.â Related: Police organizations back former Grand Rapids police officer in Patrick Lyoyaâs killing Schurr had stopped Lyoya just after 8 a.m. on Nelson Avenue SE north of Griggs Street because his car looked like one that had been reported stolen and the license plate did not match the car, the defense says. Lyoya, who was intoxicated, was uncooperative, tried to run from the officer then fought with him over control of the officerâs Taser. Schurrâs attorneys say Lyoya gained control of the Taser before Schurr, who was on top of Lyoya, and shot him once in the back of his head. Defense attorney Matthew Borgula argued that Schurr was exhausted from the lengthy struggle and feared that Lyoya would use the Taser on him. He had unsuccessfully deployed both cartridges but Borgula said that a âdry stunâ of the Taser to the officerâs skin was potentially incapacitating. Related: Grand Rapids should be held liable in Patrick Lyoya death, Crump argues at rally Borgula said Schurr had an obligation as a police officer to arrest Lyoya after he had committed felonies, including resisting and obstructing police. He said that Schurr only used deadly force after âfighting for his lifeâ in a lengthy struggle for the Taser. He said Schurrâs backup was still a minute away when the shot was fired. He contended that lower courts focused on the moment the officer shot Lyoya, 26. Feeney asked if police would be justified in shooting anyone who ignored police orders and ran. She was concerned about those suffering mental-health issues, or those who are highly intoxicated. Related: Grand Rapids should be held liable in Patrick Lyoya death, Crump argues at rally Borgula said his client didnât immediately shoot Lyoya as a âfleeing felon,â he only acted after an exhausting fight. â(Lyoya) disarmed the officer of the Taser,â he said. He said that lower courts did not consider âthe totality of the circumstances.â Katherine Wendt, Kent Countyâs chief appellate attorney, said questions about the evidence and self-defense should be left to a jury, as two other Kent County judges previously ruled. âThe job of the court is not to (decide) whether a defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.â She said jurors are tasked with evaluating evidence in any case. In this case, the entire episode, from traffic stop to shooting, was captured on video. âWe do this day in, day out in other murder cases. Itâs not a new concept,â she told the judges. She noted that Lyoya was shot in the head, âback to front,â while on the ground, with the officer on Lyoyaâs back. Witnesses said Schurr was in control despite the violent confrontation, she said. Schurr, a seven-year officer, was fired after he was charged by Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker. Related: Police officer fired days after being charged with murder of Patrick Lyoya The Michigan Fraternal Order of Police, Grand Rapids Police Officers Association and Michigan Association of Police Organizations have filed amicus curiae briefs in the appeals case arguing that the charge should be dismissed. Schurrâs attorneys say Grand Rapids District Judge Nicholas Ayoub erred in binding the case over for trial and that Kent County Circuit Judge Christina Elmore erred in affirming that ruling. The prosecutors disputed that contention. The Court of Appeals will later issue a written opinion.

Three Costa Mesa police officers who shot an armed burglary suspect multiple times after he broke into a boat repair company on Newport Boulevard in 2022, have been cleared of any wrongdoing by the Orange County district attorney’s office.  Prosecutors Thursday released findings in a report declaring Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Bang Le and officers Jake Jacobi and Oscar Nicolas acted in self defense when they fired 29 rounds at Hugo Standley Vargas who, during the early morning hours of July 13, 2022, broke into the offices of Advanced Marine Services.  For the record: An earlier version of this story inadvertently excluded the first name of CMPD Officer Daniel Bruno.  Called to the scene at 5:15 a.m. by the business’ alarm company, officers observed Vargas rummaging through the front office with an 8- to 10-inch knife in hand, repeatedly stabbing at a nearby desk, according to the report.

(File Photo)  When the then-35-year-old suspect, whose last known residence was in Corona, ignored repeated orders to drop the weapon, officers developed a plan to coax Vargas from the building, first using commands and nonlethal force, followed by lethal force, if necessary.  During a later interview, CMPD Officer Daniel Bruno told investigators “Vargas’ actions were becoming ‘increasingly aggressive’ as he failed to comply with officers’ commands.  “It just started to, um, kind of build, build a fear, if you will, that this man, you know, was irrational,’” Bruno said, according to the report.  At one point, instead of exiting the office, Vargas retreated further into the building before advancing toward officers with a bolt-action rifle in hand, the report indicated.  News Costa Mesa police shoot armed burglary suspect multiple times The Orange County district attorney’s office is investigating a police shooting that took place shortly before 5:30 a.m. Wednesday on the 2200 block of Newport Boulevard, following a reported burglary.  He then raised the firearm to sight level and aimed it through a broken window pane toward the officers, who responded with gunfire, according to video footage captured by an officer-worn body camera and released by the district attorney’s office.  Le discharged his CMPD-issued Sig Sauer 9-millimeter pistol, firing it 11 times. Jacobi also fired his gun 11 times, while Nicolas discharged seven shots, prosecutors reported.  Vargas, who sustained an undisclosed number of gunshot wounds and was mumbling incoherently while also threatening to “return and kill the officers,” was taken out of the building at 5:37 a.m. and given medical assistance.  Shortly after 6 a.m.,he arrived at UC Irvine Medical Center, where a doctor determined his wounds to be non-life threatening and who noted Vargas was paralyzed on one side of his body.  County Crime Lab investigators examine bullet casings in a shipyard at Advanced Marine Services on Wednesday, July 13, 2022. (File Photo)  Prosecutors determined the rifle aimed at the officers was unloaded and belonged to the owner of the business.  “Under the circumstances in this encounter, the officers’ belief that Vargas posed a threat of death or serious bodily injury was reasonable,” investigators concluded. “Sgt. Le and officers Jacobi and Nicolas appear to have carried out their duties as peace officers in a reasonable and justifiable manner.”  Appearing in court for a May 16 hearing, Vargas acted in accordance with a plea agreement, pleading guilty to felony counts of exhibiting a firearm in the presence of an officer, second-degree burglary, exhibiting a firearm to resist or prevent arrest and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  A sentence of three years in prison was suspended by the court, pending successful completion of three years of formal probation, court records indicate."
"Read, listen and study everything aja monet does",9/5/23,2023-09-06T03:06:26Z,en,latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/image/story/2023-09-05/the-radical-imagination-of-activist-surrealist-blues-poet-aja-monet,https://web.archive.org/web/20230906030626id_/https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/image/story/2023-09-05/the-radical-imagination-of-activist-surrealist-blues-poet-aja-monet,https://web.archive.org/web/20230906030626/https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/image/story/2023-09-05/the-radical-imagination-of-activist-surrealist-blues-poet-aja-monet,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGxhdGltZXMpL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9pbWFnZS9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTA5LTA1L3RoZS1yYWRpY2FsLWltYWdpbmF0aW9uLW9mLWFjdGl2aXN0LXN1cnJlYWxpc3QtYmx1ZXMtcG9ldC1hamEtbW9uZXQ~,"aja monet calls herself a surrealist blues poet. When I ask her for a definition, she replies, âA musician of the subversive imagination â¦ a truth-telling magician.â Try as I might, I cannot come up with a more apt description of who she is, what she does and what she means. And if this seems too esoteric, just listen to her debut album, âwhen the poems do what they do,â and youâll know exactly what she means. A word musician of Caribbean descent and American dissent, monet understands poems as life force, expressed and animated through breath, body, memory, experience, imagination, spirits and ancestors. Her poems are powerful and dangerous, like violets pushing through concrete to kiss the sun, or unarmed people, arms locked, chanting and singing, forcing armies to retreat. She is that unstoppable violet beckoned by sun. A warrior who wields words like a bouquet of hand grenades that sprout water lilies upon detonation. Robin D.G. Kelley and Vinson Cunningham on L.A. solidarity and the Black Radical Tradition. Wisdom belies her mere 36 years on this earth. She came on the scene at 19, becoming the youngest poet to win the Nuyorican Grand Slam competition. She then tossed aside her laurels and leaped headlong into the raging river of struggle. When we first met in 2016, at a movement retreat in Fruitland, Fla., I knew her as a lead organizer with the Dream Defenders. No one had to tell me she was a poet. Her words, voice, cadence and fiery imagination, blazing like the Florida sun, gave her away. She wasnât just a movement poet. She brought poetry to movement â to the Community Justice Project, to Say Her Name, to the arts collective she co-founded, Smoke Signals Studio in Miami. And she brought movement to poetry, through live performances and books, including âThe Black Unicorn Singsâ (2010), âInner-City Chants and Cyborg Cyphersâ (2015), her landmark collection âMy Mother Was a Freedom Fighterâ (2017) and the much-anticipated âFlorida Water: Poemsâ (2023). Read, listen and study everything aja monet does. Below is a very brief distillation of a two-hour conversation. We barely scratched the surface. And sheâs not done. Robin D.G. Kelley: Your spectacular collection of poems, âMy Mother Was a Freedom Fighterâ â the title itself is a kind of universal declaration and yet so personal and intimate. Talk about your mother. Whoâs your mother? aja monet: My mother is probably one of the most fascinating, important people in my life that has shaped so much of how I see the world. After all, she birthed me. She named me. When I was younger, I didnât understand all that she was doing. The book, for me, was that expression of: Imagine what the world could have been like for you, what kind of mother you could have been had the world been a little easier on you, had you had the resources and support to be a full human to raise a child and feel supported. I was just thinking about how we take for granted the actual role of mothering as a real struggle. In an excerpt of the poem âthe red sheavesâ from his forthcoming collection, âperennial fashion presence falling,â the multihyphenate artist gives a sneak peek of an infinitely rich and more unruly freedom jam. RDGK: Your definition of âfreedom fighterâ is expansive. In your familyâs life, fighting for freedom isnât the clichÃ© of militants standing up to police dogs and state power. Can you talk about the bookâs title and how you imagine what it means to be a freedom fighter as a working-class Black woman in late 20th century Brooklyn? AM: Everywhere I moved in the world, I saw mothers struggling â to live, to love and to care for the people that they love. We all have to have a mother; somebody created us. Why is it that we have not found a way in our society to, at the very least, create reverence for that in every way, shape or form? It would just seem like a no-brainer. I think there comes a point in oneâs life when you see patterns. You start to ask questions. My grandmother was a big figure in my life. And she was a santera; my grandmotherâs Cuban. I grew up with people coming to her to problem solve, to help resolve some sort of conflict or ailment or trouble in their life, including other members of the family. In the summer she would love to sit on the front porch, and she always forced me to sit outside with her â I used to hate it, because I was like, âWhat am I going to do just sitting here?â And what I realized is that she was teaching me something. We used to sit there, and people would come up and talk to her and Iâd overhear all types of conversations, questions and ideas. I learned to read people sitting on the front porch with her. I think that helped me observe mannerisms and patterns and ways of being. RDGK: So you grew up with the Orishas? When you were coming up as a child, and you saw your grandmother engage in this practice, did you know what was going on? AM: Itâs always been in the periphery of my upbringing, because it was just there. I didnât have any choice in the matter. Now, itâs become popular and itâs a thing. I grew up in a time [when] you didnât bring that stuff out in public. You never talked about alternative religious practices outside of Christian, Jewish, Muslim religions. It was real taboo to even bring it up. It never was something that I was necessarily proud of or curious about. RDGK: Today many contemporary artists draw on ancestor divination for its aesthetics without any deep understanding of the practice or its power. You bring a depth that is really unusual. AM: It shows up in my work, but itâs just because it naturally does that. Itâs not because Iâve been like, âI need to talk about this, and everybody needs to know.â Because, for better or worse, I learned that the power of magic is in its invisibility, itâs silent. RDGK: You grew up in East New York, in Brooklyn, in the â90s. Describe that landscape, what it meant for you. AM: One of the things that I always have to preface with when talking about Brooklyn is that my mother was a single mother who was often trying to find housing and support her kids. So we would live in other places. We lived in Queens a lot of the time that I was growing up. But Brooklyn was the place we often returned to, where I would spend a lot of summers or when my mom couldnât be with us. I know that people think of east New York as this dangerous, horrible place, but we loved going to Grandmaâs house because we got to be outside. We would be on the front porch. We would go out to the park. It was when we didnât have so many hands over us. We got to be kids, we got to be free. It was the place where I felt like we did have somewhat of a childhood [and] that felt so New York. RDGK: I read somewhere that you were typing and writing poetry at 8 years old. Walk me through that. How did you come to the form of poetry? What were you reading? What were you trying to express in words? AM: That typewriter was the first thing I can remember enthusiastically asking my mother for Christmas. It wasnât for poetry. I just wanted to feel the energy and gesture of being at a typewriter. Because I really loved telling stories. When I was with my cousins, we would make up all these stories; we would pretend. It was like a musician with their instrument. Itâs our official instrument, because the pen and paper are not so fun. Typewriters? You got to put the ink, thereâs paper â itâs like a whole dance, a choreography, being with the typewriter. I think the act of that made [me feel] like Iâm a real writer â and that was what I was aspiring to. I didnât really think about poetry until high school. You cannot beg a god for forgiveness, but you can be ready when he hints at offering it after a long standoff. RDGK: But you wrote stories. AM: Poetry in elementary school did come up through Langston Hughes. I remember we went to the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture]. I remember seeing Langston Hughes on the floor, the words on the floor. I remember the simplicity of his poetry. The only books that I remember having a visceral, really deep impact was âThe Diary of Anne Frankâ and âGo Ask Alice,â as young-adult books that I was reading. Later on, we started getting the âhood books with âColdest Winter Everâ by Sister Souljah, all that. My introduction to literature and reading was poetry and diaries. There was something about the honesty and being in somebodyâs emotions that made me want to have my own diary. That was the first time I was like, âI really, really want to write. I want to have my own little diary.â RDGK: You emerge not just as a brilliant poet but a brilliant poet in New York â a city thatâs full of brilliant poets. I read that you knew Saul Williams way back. When did you meet him? AM: The first time I met Saul Williams was in the Bay Area after I had competed to join the Brave New Voices youth poetry slam team again, because I didnât make it in 2004. In 2005 I competed again, and I made it onto the poetry team for New York City. It was the first time I ever traveled by myself somewhere for poetry. I knew I was doing something great â look at us, weâre traveling the world with our poems. My friends make fun of me now, but I was very committed to poetry and the power of poetry and what poetry was going to do to change the world. Saul was the pinnacle of what you could be as a poet at that time, because there werenât many examples for us. We went off and won nationals that year, as a team. I say it to this day that if you could have been in those poetry bouts â the things the kids were writing were just so ahead and politically astute. We were talking about Bush, climate and housing â all the issues that now are so popular. At that time, nobody was talking about those things. We take for granted that pop culture had everybody in a coma. No one was really addressing the undercurrent of what was happening politically in the country. It was youth poets and their mentors. We had nothing holding us back. We had nothing to lose. We had no jobs that were going to get taken from us. What could our parents do? It was our little moment to say what we felt about the world that we couldnât control. RDGK: That was a real renaissance for poetry, I remember. AM: I think that thereâs a direct correlation to that era of young people, in those communities, to the political organizing moments that we have now. Even the way that hip-hop curriculums were being developed and being used as political education in schools and grassroots community organizations, etc. A lot of those poets who were rappers, who were singers, who were artists, were teaching artists â thatâs how they survived. They would take their work into schools and be training up the next generation with the politics of our time through the art and literature that they were sharing. I think that thatâs what equips so many young people to have the sort of leftist politics that they do now. Poet Christopher Soto unpacks how the history of policing has shaped and scarred the urban fabric of Los Angeles. RDGK: You might be considered, interestingly enough, part of the Trayvon generation â itâs not my term. That is to say, the generation of activists who confronted this wave of spectacular incidents of premature death. And you end up doing so as a grown person under a Black president. Can you tell the story about how you got there, your work with the Dream Defenders, and what it means to be a poet organizer? AM: For me, I would say weâre from the Sean Bell generation â in terms of one of the moments where a public, outrageous, horrendous tragedy mobilized a lot of young people, or at least awakened me. Iâll never forget the image of the car with the bullet holes in it. Sean Bell was with his wife; it was on their wedding night. He was a young Black brother. The police shot up his car an insane number of times. Thereâs been a tense history [with the police] from the time I was a kid, because of my uncles, and what I saw them go through, and my brother, which I have a poem about. Just the way the police addressed us, the way they moved in our community â itâs never been great. If I were to fast-forward to having that be a part of my upbringing, the sort of environment that we exist in, surely it would impact who I would become and the issues or values I would be concerned about. Moving from an emotional place, a truthful place, you feel like somethingâs not fair. You feel the gravity of injustice, and you want to do something. I think that impacted me, in every way, shape and form. Poetry was the one place where I saw other people who wanted to change something. I donât think we always felt, at least at that time, that we had organizations to go to. Fast-forward, my relationship to Florida began because of my relationship to Phil [Phillip Agnew, the co-founder of Dream Defenders], which began because of my relationship to Palestine, which began because of my relationship to poetry .... RDGK: So you go to Palestineâ¦ AM: January 2015, I go to Palestine, and I fell in love. I fell in love with Phil, but I also fell in love with the movement. I wanted to be a part of people who werenât just saying they wanted to do something but people who were trying to do the thing. Palestine politicized me in a way that there was no going back the same. I wasnât going to just go back to trying to be a poet and publish some books. RDGK: Your forthcoming book, âFlorida Waterâ â are those poems you wrote while you were there? Are they about Florida, about Palestine? AM: They are a little bit of all of that â theyâre notes, journal entries from the time I was organizing. Itâs also heartbreak, love, nature â the role that nature played for me in Florida. There are metaphors to Florida water. It all comes back to the childhood of growing up with the Orishas in the background and the ethos of that, because Florida water is one of the main spiritual cleansing waters that we use â the cologne that they get from the store, they use for the spiritual cleanses that my grandmother used to make. RDGK: Africa is also very important to you, politically, ancestrally, culturally. You spent some time in Ghana recently. Can you talk about that? AM: Iâve always wanted to go to Africa and never had the ability to go on my own before. [My friend] Vic Mensa, whoâs a young poet, MC, artist â [his] dad was from Ghana [and] he ended up going during COVID, building all these relationships, made some music. During COVID, I had moved to L.A., and I got brought in to do this work with V-Day. I knew that we were trying to build relationships with Black women in the States, but there was still so much for us to mend and so many deeper connections that needed to be made among African women of the diaspora and in the States and African women on the continent. It was an exciting project for me to be brought in to create this new play that would center Black womenâs stories but to use that artistic venture to also organize. This organization does work with African women, but it was COVID, so there wasnât a guarantee that I was going to be able to go. Vic was going and it was just opening back up, so he was my liaison into being able to show me Ghana, because of his family. When I went, I made it a point to connect with women poets and writers and artists. At the time, we were doing this thing called a listening tour â we were trying to just listen to women. The play is called âVoices,â but the most important thing about having a voice and using your voice is also knowing how to listen, and when to use your voice. RDGK: So the play is a compilation of a wide variety of Black womenâs experiences? Elaine Kahn lives in L.A. and teaches at Poetry Field School. Her poem âA WORLD THAT IS NOT REALLY A WORLDâ is part of Image issue 8, âDeserted.â AM: When they brought me on to do the play, I didnât want to be the person writing for Black women or speaking for Black women. I wanted it to be an experience where Black women told their stories for themselves, and that it would be a listening experience, that it would be an audio play. I didnât want it to be a situation where people are trying to act out Black women or overperform. What does it mean for people to really have to listen, to embody the voices rather than for Black women to be further objectified on a stage? I wanted to turn theater on its head because the performative aspect of being Black has so many dimensions. What does it mean to make people close their eyes and listen? RDGK: This is an audio play comprised of Black womenâs stories from around the world, in their own voices. Are you saying that audiences gather to hear the play without any visuals? AM: No visuals. They have their eyes closed the entire time. RDGK: Wow. Letâs talk about the album, âwhen the poems do what they do.â How did you conceive of this work and what do you want the poems to do? AM: I have yet to see or witness what the poems are capable of. Because I think that they will always be doing. If they are effective, they will always be doing â and hopefully, necessary. I think about when Amiri [Baraka] talks about a poem being urgent â as urgent as eating bread, or a sweater in the winter. My hope is that the poems will remain necessary and urgent. In terms of this album, I feel so grateful, because as a poet â you see, on [my] wall, all these records that poets have made â I just wanted to be able to continue to live in that tradition and for it to be supported and fully invested in, financially, strategically, production-wise. All of the things that went into making this album took a lot of other people believing that this album was worth making. And it took organizing â itâs probably the culmination of one of the most important organizing projects of my life. Everything led to this moment. So the poems did do â theyâve done and they will continue to do. I think the poems led me to be taken seriously, as an organizer and as an artist. There was a point in my life when I think the two were at odds with each other or made to feel like they had to be at odds with each other. This album is the first real integration in my creative life, that reflects who I aspire to be, who I hope to be. Robin D.G. Kelley is the Gary B.

Louis Johnson Jr. was killed after a car chase that ended in gunfire, the Cowlitz County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday. Cowlitz 911 dispatchers received reports around 2 p.m. of a man passed out in a car in the Minami Teriyaki drive-thru at 1208 15th Ave. Restaurant staff were not able to wake him, according to the Sheriff’s Office. Paramedics arrived and used naloxone on the man, who woke up and became aggressive, the Sheriff’s Office said. He allegedly threatened medical personnel and then left the scene in an orange Dodge Challenger “showing signs of impairment,” the Sheriff’s Office said. Officers responded and found a car matching the description near 15th Avenue and Hudson Street. Police tried to stop the car, driven by Johnson, but he allegedly ran a red light and sped off, slamming on his breaks and at one point driving in reverse to escape, the Sheriff’s Office said. Police blocked Johnson near 19th Avenue and Florida Street, where he allegedly pulled out a pistol and started shooting at the officers, the Sheriff’s Office said. Three Longview police officers fired back, hitting and killing Johnson. No officers were harmed in the exchange. Investigators recovered a 9 mm pistol with no serial number. Law enforcement said it was an illegally manufactured “ghost gun.” The Lower Columbia Major Crimes Team is investigating the shooting. The officers involved in the shooting have not been identified."
CT has required police body cameras for two years. Have things changed?,9/3/23,2023-09-04T03:23:04Z,en,courant.com,https://www.courant.com/2023/09/03/ct-has-required-police-body-cameras-for-two-years-have-things-changed/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230904032304id_/https://www.courant.com/2023/09/03/ct-has-required-police-body-cameras-for-two-years-have-things-changed/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230904032304/https://www.courant.com/2023/09/03/ct-has-required-police-body-cameras-for-two-years-have-things-changed/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNvdXJhbnQpLzIwMjMvMDkvMDMvY3QtaGFzLXJlcXVpcmVkLXBvbGljZS1ib2R5LWNhbWVyYXMtZm9yLXR3by15ZWFycy1oYXZlLXRoaW5ncy1jaGFuZ2Vk,"The call of a domestic disturbance came at 6:39 p.m. As Officer Haylee Ouellette approached the apartment in Manchester, a body-worn camera recording a cop’s-eye view of her arrival, a man inside could be heard screaming, “Shut your mouth!”  “Hey, hey, hey! What’s up? What’s happening?” Ouellette called out, her voice casual. She opened a screen door and leaned in. “Why are we yelling at each other?”  Joseph Diloreto was profanely berating a woman inside the apartment. He did not directly answer Ouellette until she stepped inside. Then his attention shifted from his female acquaintance to the officer, anger coming to a rapid boil.  In quick succession, he slapped at the officer, dodged a shot from a non-lethal Taser, grabbed a knife and advanced on Ouellette.  “Oh, my God,” said Diloreto’s companion.  Ouellette backed from the apartment to a courtyard, now aiming her handgun, not the Taser. Diloreto called her a “wimp.” Ouellette told him to drop the knife, or she would shoot. Diloreto hesitated by the door, then came out. He waved his arms and yelled, “Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.”  He kept coming. Ouellette fired.  “Shots fired,” she radioed, her voice tight. “Multiple shots fired.”  Ouellette was the first of three Connecticut police officers to shoot someone this summer. Shootings in Manchester in July and West Hartford and Middletown in August left one man dead and two wounded.  Two incidents involved men who seemed impaired — the one with a knife in Manchester, another with a claw hammer in Middletown — as they inexplicably attacked armed officers.  In the other, a car chase and brief manhunt preceded a K-9 officer in West Hartford shooting and killing a suspected car thief in a chaotic, claustrophobic confrontation involving the cop, his dog and the suspect on the front seat of a moving car.  All three shootings were recorded by the body-worn cameras that police call BWCs. Each time, public release of the videos came quickly and without prodding from the press, transparency mandated by a 2020 police accountability law.  Introduced elsewhere a decade ago, BWC use in Connecticut has evolved from a voluntary pilot project authorized by the General Assembly in 2015 to their required use, effective July 1, 2021. Every use of deadly force by a local or state police officer since then has been captured by an unblinking camera.  “It’s transformative,” said Robert J. Devlin Jr., a former prosecutor and judge who is approaching the midpoint of a four-year term as Connecticut’s first inspector general, responsible for assessing every police use of deadly force.  Centralizing use-of-force investigations in the Office of Inspector General is one of the reforms in the 2020 law, Connecticut’s reaction to the citizen video of a handcuffed George Floyd dying while a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for 9 minutes while other cops watched without intervening.  The Connecticut law requires police to intervene when witnessing brutality by fellow cops, mandates body and dash cameras, bans chokeholds in most circumstances and clarifies that deadly force can be used only when police exhaust all reasonable alternatives.  And it resolves any question about when or whether to release BWC and dash-cam videos after critical incidents. The law mandates release within four days, and Devlin generally has posted them online even faster, accompanied by brief summaries identifying the officers involved.  The practice and clear legal requirement stands in contrast to other states.  In Cambridge, Mass., as the Boston Globe reported last week, officials have yet to identify the police officer who shot and killed a college student on Jan. 4, saying the legal authority for disclosure is unclear. There was no requirement to wear a BWC, and Cambridge officials had not provided one.  Connecticut is one of at least seven states mandating the statewide use of body-worn cameras, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Regardless of state laws, most larger police departments now employ them throughout the United States.  There is a consensus that body-worn cameras are game changers, at least in assessing police on their worst days, when a firearm is unholstered and fired, as well as resolving complaints. Was a cop rude? Did they really use a racial epithet? Did they strike someone without cause?  “Well, now you watch the body cam,” said Paul Melanson, the chief of police in Avon and current chair of the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association.  BWC videos are downloaded and logged at the end of every shift, a cinematic record of everything from the most mundane of police interactions with the public to confrontations involving deadly force, like the ones from Manchester, Middletown and West Hartford.  Most of the devices have automatic triggers. When an officer activates a cruiser’s lights or siren responding to call, the body and dash cams begin recording, Melanson said. In other situations, the BWC must be manually activated, a habit most officers have developed, he said.  Michael P. Lawlor, a criminal justice professor and former prosecutor, lawmaker and gubernatorial adviser who sits on the New Haven Police Commission and the state board that sets police training standards, said the videos are neutral witnesses, allowing quicker resolutions of complaints.  Research has found that complaints drop when the cameras are used.  Harder to assess is how the BWCs are changing policing.  Early studies are inconclusive, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington, D.C., group that advises police on everything from training and tactics to how to best recruit and retain police in a tight labor market.  “The one thing that hasn’t happened is we haven’t seen a major reduction in some kinds of use of force with body-worn cameras,” Wexler said. “And I think that the answer to that is that body-worn cameras by themselves will not change policing — body-worn cameras with new training, new policies and new oversight will.”  Wexler said BWC videos already have been a training tool, showing real-life examples of police shootings that could have avoided with different tactics, especially when confronted with someone acting irrationally.  “From our standpoint, it has been an epiphany in how you think about force and how you train police to prevent unnecessary force, so that ultimately everybody can go home safe,” Wexler said.  The Police Executive Research Forum, has developed a use-of-force protocol for handling people who are behaving erratically and dangerously but do not possess a firearm. It is dubbed ICAT for “integrating communications, assessment and tactics.”  ICAT preaches against moving quickly when a subject is safely confined but showing signs of mental illness.  “The last thing they want is a police officer aiming a firearm at them and barking orders. But that’s how police have been taught,” Wexler said.  It is the scenario that unfolded on Jan. 15, 2020 when 19-year-old Mubarak Soulemane of New Haven was shot to death by State Trooper Brian North after an on-and-off chase on I-95 from Norwalk to West Haven.  As recounted by Devlin’s investigative report, Soulemane led police on a chase at speeds reaching 100 miles per hour before police boxed him in just off I-95 in West Haven. He sat alone behind the wheel of the car he had stolen from a Lyft driver after acting erratically at a cell phone store.  His eyes were closed, and he ignored shouts to exit the car. Soulemane’s family says he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 14.  North stood outside the driver’s door, aiming his handgun at Soulemane’s chest through the closed window. A West Haven officer, Robert Rappa, broke a passenger side window. At North’s urging, another trooper fired his Taser, which failed to penetrate Soulemane’s jacket.  “He’s reaching,” Rappa yelled.  Souleman pulled a serrated knife from his pocket and pointed it at the roof of the car. North fired seven times.  Devlin took over the investigation in November 2021, two months after becoming inspector general. His task was to assess whether North’s use of force was “objectively reasonable,” a legal standard that gives police the benefit of the doubt.  To find an officer criminally culpable, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that police did not act in defense of themselves or others. In a scathing report issued in April 2022, Devlin concluded that North’s actions could not be justified, nor were they reasonable by any measure.  He charged North with manslaughter, the first officer to be criminally charged under the new accountability law.  “At the time Trooper North fired his weapon, neither he nor any other person was in imminent danger of serious injury or death from a knife attack at the hands of Soulemane,” Devlin wrote. “Further, any belief that persons were in such danger was not reasonable.”  North told investigators that he believed that Rappa was about to enter the car, and he feared that Soulemane might stab the West Haven officer.  There is body and dash camera video from various angles of the shooting, but the images from North’s BWC may be of limited use in resolving whether North saw anything justifying that belief.  James W. Borden, a retired Nevada police officer and court-certified expert witness in use-of-force cases, said in an interview that not every BWC video will show precisely what an officer saw and reacted to in a matter of seconds.  “They have to make sense of what’s occurring in front of them. And at that point that starts to drive a decision,” said Borden, who reviewed North’s shooting and concluded the trooper could have had a reasonable belief of an imminent threat.  Because North was leaning forward, the camera worn on his chest aimed slightly lower than his actual line of sight, and the view was further obscured by his outstretched hands that held his pistol. But Devin’s report noted that Rappa told investigators that North was mistaken. He was not entering the car and had no intention to do so.  “Rappa told Inspectors that he broke the window to communicate with Soulemane, and facilitate the use of less lethal means to gain control of him,” Devlin wrote. “A reasonable police officer would have realized that the police were in control of the situation and the opportunity existed to take a tactical pause to explore the use of methods other than deadly force.”  Having body camera footage and having the ability to quickly see a situation as it actually unfolded, and then having the ability to share that video with the community as quickly as possible, has been vital.  Devlin’s report went beyond an assessment of North. He faulted a more senior trooper for failing to take command and all the officers for barely communicating with each other or Soulemane.  “There was no plan. This is why events took on a life of their own after the window shattered. Somebody needed to assert leadership, take a tactical pause, and examine the best course to accomplish safely the arrest of Soulemane,” Devlin wrote.  Claudine Constant, the public policy and advocacy director of the ACLU in Connecticut, is generally a critic of the accountability law, saying the standards for judging police are too lax. But she said she appreciates Devlin’s willingness to take a broader view of the tactics behind use of force incidents  “It’s welcome reading,” she said.  In an interview, Devlin downplayed his role in offering critiques.  “My office can’t impose change on police agencies in Connecticut. We would never presume to do that,” Devlin said. But, he added, “I’ve tried to make what I thought were common-sense recommendations in some situations for their consideration, in terms of whether they think is a good idea or not.”  There has been no broader assessment of the accountability law, but there is a consensus from police, policy makers and politicians that the BWCs and clear rules for the release of the videos are worthwhile.  After Hartford police fatally shot Alphonso Zaporta while struggling to pull him from a car in July 2019, it was unclear what BWC video would be released. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin pressed for immediate release, knowing the view from inside the car would show what some witnesses could not see: Zaporta had taken hold of an officer’s gun.  Bronin was relieved when the investigating prosecutor complied.  “Having body camera footage and having the ability to quickly see a situation as it actually unfolded, and then having the ability to share that video with the community as quickly as possible, has been vital in the wake of tragedies in this community and so many other communities,” Bronin said.  In contrast to Cambridge, there were no lingering community complaints in Hartford over a lack of transparency.  To the surprise of some experts, police have embraced patrolling with a digital big brother that sees and hears most public interactions.  “The conventional thinking 10 years ago was cops won’t want this. This is another intrusion,” said Wexler, whose organization wrote the original guidelines for their use. “Today, if you tried to take away those cameras, the cops would actually be upset.”  Melanson said that has been the case since Connecticut made the cameras mandatory. “It is not only embraced, I mean, I know that they won’t go out without it. It has become just a part of what they’re doing.”  Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, a police detective, ultimately voted against the 2020 police accountability law, but for provisions unrelated to the camera mandate.  “The truth is told right from the beginning,” Howard said. “So I think that from a perspective of transparency, certainly it’s a great thing.”  Mark Pazniokas is a reporter for The Connecticut Mirror (https://ctmirror.org/ ).

Fatal police shooting of pregnant Ohio woman raises concerns over firing at moving vehicles,9/3/23,2023-09-04T10:02:38Z,en,metro.us,https://www.metro.us/fatal-police-shooting-of-pregnant-ohio-woman-raises-concerns-over-firing-at-moving-vehicles/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230904100238id_/https://www.metro.us/fatal-police-shooting-of-pregnant-ohio-woman-raises-concerns-over-firing-at-moving-vehicles/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230904100238/https://www.metro.us/fatal-police-shooting-of-pregnant-ohio-woman-raises-concerns-over-firing-at-moving-vehicles/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/dXMsbWV0cm8pL2ZhdGFsLXBvbGljZS1zaG9vdGluZy1vZi1wcmVnbmFudC1vaGlvLXdvbWFuLXJhaXNlcy1jb25jZXJucy1vdmVyLWZpcmluZy1hdC1tb3ZpbmctdmVoaWNsZXM~,"Body camera video of the fatal police shooting of Ta’Kiya Young, a 21-year-old pregnant mother in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, has raised questions about how an allegation of shoplifting led to a bullet being fired through her windshield. It was unclear Saturday whether the Blendon Township Police Department has adopted a use-of-force continuum policy, which would outline measures that must be exhausted before lethal force can be used. The video of the Aug. 24 shooting, released Friday, shows Young in her car in a parking space as a police officer orders her to exit the vehicle. A second officer is seen drawing his firearm and stepping in front of the car, despite a department policy advising officers to get out of the way of an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapon. âAre you going to shoot me?â Young asks, seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the second officer. The officer fires through the windshield and Youngâs sedan drifts into the grocery storeâs brick wall. Lawyers for Youngâs family say the video is devastating and have called for the officer who shot her to be fired and criminally charged. Blendon police officials have refused to name either of the officers involved. Here is a look at law enforcement policies on moving vehicles: WHAT ABOUT FIRING AT MOVING CARS? The New York City Police Department was among the first to bar officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting that killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car led to protests. Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s found the policy, along with a handful of other use-of-force restrictions, led to a decline in bystanders being shot and suspects dying in police shootings. Other law enforcement agencies have over the decades followed NYPD’s lead, and industry organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended the restrictions, saying shooting in such circumstances creates an unacceptable risk to bystanders from stray gunfire or the driver losing control of the vehicle if shot. The Blendon Township departmentâs policy states: âAn officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.â But as of June only 32 police departments in the 100 largest U.S. cities had some form of restriction on firing at moving vehicles, according to Campaign Zero, an advocacy group of academics, activists and others seeking to end police brutality. HOW ARE SUCH POLICIES INTERPRETED AND ENFORCED? John P. Gross of the University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about the challenges of ending police shooting at moving vehicles, said individual department policies sometimes include exceptions if a suspect is firing a weapon or if the car is being used as a weapon against an officer, though many restrictions specifically say other weapons must be present. Prosecutors and internal police investigators often focus on the moment of use of force, but a broader view is necessary, he said. For example if an officer already has a license plate number, that may be a reason not to use force to stop a vehicle, since âmost of us are findable.â âIf you are pursuing someone accused of a homicide and who has shot at officers in the past, thatâs a different situation than somebody who might have shoplifted $50 worth of items,â Gross said. âThat context should be part of this.â Departments often donât enforce the policies with meaningful discipline in part because of the strength of police unions, Gross said. In Blendon Township, union officials have said Youngâs car became a weapon the moment it began moving. SHOULD OFFICERS PURPOSELY MOVE IN FRONT OF VEHICLES? Many department policies advise officers to move out of the way. But in the Ohio video, an officer is seen drawing his firearm and putting himself in the path of Young’s parked car, which Gross called âbad tactics.â âAnd oftentimes bad tactics translates to needing to use more force than was necessary,” Gross said. “The officer shouldnât put himself in front of the car. He canât stop the car with his body.â Edward Obayashi, a national use-of-force expert and attorney who specializes in vehicle-related police shootings, agreed and said the officer went against his training. âThe best practice in these matters nationwide is that you do not put yourself in a position of danger,â Obayashi said. “There was no urgent need for him to position himself the way he did.â Gross also questioned why the officer drew his firearm when the issue at hand was a shoplifting allegation. He urged changes to police training. âThey are taught that if someone is resisting even verbally, that person is going to fight or flee,â Gross said. âThat just ties resistance to a threat. Training teaches officers that there is danger around every corner and threats are everywhere.â"

JOSEPH COUNTY, MI – In the six months since St. Joseph County Sheriff Mark Lillywhite crashed while drunk driving at nearly 100 mph, he’s faced challenges in his personal and professional life.  He’s faced calls to lose his elected post. He filed for divorce with his wife. And he worked two jobs outside of law enforcement while keeping his sheriff title, according to his attorney.  Despite the obvious issues with a sheriff drunk driving and crashing into a car full of citizens – which he pleaded guilty to in April – it’s Lillywhite’s absence from work that has put his job in jeopardy.  The St. Joseph County Board of Commissioners voted 6-1 in August to request Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remove Lillywhite as sheriff because he’s neglecting his duties as sheriff. In Michigan, a sheriff can only be removed by governor’s order or a recall.  In a phone call with MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette, the Republican sheriff said he’s “not really that concerned” about the county’s move. He declined to comment further when asked questions.  Related: Governor’s order, recall are the only options to remove a Michigan sheriff  “I’m not interested, thanks though,” Lillywhite said when reached by phone on Aug. 29. He hung up when asked if he planned to resign, and did not respond to the question.  Drunken crash causes sheriff problems  Lillywhite was speeding at 96 to 99 mph in his county-issued SUV when he rear-ended a vehicle going the 55-mph speed limit at 2:20 a.m. Sunday, Feb. 26. He didn’t apply the brakes before the crash, per the Michigan State Police report obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.  The crash happened on southbound U.S. 131 near YZ Avenue in Kalamazoo County, which is just north of St. Joseph County.  The moments after Lillywhite crashed were captured on police body cameras, as officers responded to the wreck. Lillywhite wasn’t physically injured, police reports say, but the sheriff seemed to realize the crash could cause other problems for him.  He crawled from the driver’s seat to the passenger seat after the crash, according to South Kalamazoo County Fire Authority Battalion Chief Shawn Westfall, the first emergency responder at the scene.  He refused a preliminary breath test and told a trooper he was not driving, crash reports state.  A trooper asked what happened.  “I don’t know,” Lillywhite said. “All I know is I went in the ditch and I don’t got no clue.”  Lillywhite’s St. Joseph County Sheriff’s badge was in the center console, along with a loaded pistol, the report said. Two more guns were found in the trunk.  A person from the vehicle that was hit said he didn’t see any headlights before he suddenly felt a vehicle crash into them from the rear, the report said. The citizen’s vehicle rolled at least once.  A witness told police Lillywhite was “trashed.”  Sheriff Mark Lillywhite on Feb. 26, 2023, after crashing into another vehicle on U.S. 131 in Kalamazoo County. He was charged with a pair of misdemeanors.  Lillywhite had a blood alcohol content of .252 -- more than three times the .08 legal limit for driving in Michigan.  The sheriff testified in April he was drinking alcohol before the crash, while pleading guilty to a pair of misdemeanor charges against him. He apologized in court to everyone who was involved in the incident, from the citizens he represents to the employees of the sheriff’s office.  Lillywhite was sentenced to one year of probation. Prior to sentencing, Lillywhite had already spent about a month in intensive alcohol treatment, according to his attorney.  The sheriff could have been charged with a felony and sentenced to up to 15 years in prison if his crash would have killed or seriously impaired others, per state law.  Sheriff worked three jobs, spent time in divorce court  This summer, Lillywhite was working three jobs, and he has since quit one of the jobs – at FedEx – his attorney, Leslie Payseno, said at a family court hearing on Aug. 7. Lillywhite is making about $105,000 in 2023 as sheriff, per county documents received via FOIA. The number will go up to $107,000 in 2024.  Lillywhite’s drinking is brought up as an issue in his divorce proceedings by his partner, Heather Lillywhite.  Her attorney, Joe Vander Horst, said there was “a hostile environment created in this house for many years by the plaintiff with alcoholism, which ultimately culminated in his arrest.”  “He’s hopefully maintaining his sobriety,” Vander Horst said about the sheriff. “But alcohol was a cloud in this family, your honor, (and) for many years a hostile environment was involved. What we’re trying to do is heal this family.”  Lillywhite can be seen in the YouTube video of the hearing posted by the court. His microphone is muted, but the sheriff can be seen speaking to his attorney across the table.  The sheriff said he let his deputies, his voters and his family down, during a WWMT interview last month. He characterized the Feb. 26 incident as a “horrible mistake.” An emotional Lillywhite said he’s thankful nobody was seriously hurt in the crash, as that would’ve been the worst-case scenario from his actions.  Lillywhite asked for forgiveness in the interview and said he’s made changes to be a better person.  “I screwed up one time,” Lillywhite told the reporter, saying he’s taken ownership.  Limited avenues to remove an elected official  Lillywhite was elected to a four-year term as sheriff that started in 2021. He served as undersheriff from 2009 to 2020 and started with the department in 1995 as a correction’s officer.  The sheriff is directly responsible to the citizens of St. Joseph County for effective law enforcement services as well as the safe and effective operation of the jail, the office website states.  However, Undersheriff Jason Bingaman said he’s been doing more of the daily work that was previously done by the sheriff. Bingaman, Lillywhite’s second in command, announced his candidacy for the office of sheriff in June for the 2024 election.  “He is still the sheriff. I am his employee,” Bingaman told MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette after an Aug. 7 news conference about a double homicide and the fatal police shooting of the suspect. Lillywhite was not present.  “The office is running smoothly,” Bingaman said.  The St. Joseph County Sheriff's Office on Aug. 7, 2023.  County commissioners have noticed Lillywhite’s absence.  After Lillywhite declined to answer questions from the board and walked out of the Aug. 15 board meeting, the commissioners voted to send a letter to Whitmer asking for his removal.  Commissioner Ken Malone said Lillywhite told him he planned to resign, but has not. Lillywhite “hasn’t been at work in months,” Malone said.  “The board believes that Sheriff Lillywhite has willfully neglected the duties of his office and this is the reason for the board petitioning the governor for his removal,” said Richard Cherry of Miller Johnson, who is the attorney representing St. Joseph County.

MLive has requested the pending letter from the county. The letter hasn’t been sent yet as attorneys continue crafting the message, officials said Friday, Sept. 1.  The governor can remove county officers for reasons including being guilty of official misconduct; willful neglect of duty; extortion; habitual drunkenness; or convicted of being drunk.  This isn’t the first time Whitmer has been asked to remove a troublesome sheriff. The Jackson County Board of Commissioners sent multiple requests to Whitmer in 2019 to remove its sheriff for a litany of alleged discretions, including mocking an employee for his disability, making a comment about an imagined snuff film with a female courthouse employee, using racial slurs, discharging his gun in his office and not filing a report on it and calling a county judge a “scatterbrained c---.”  Whitmer rejected multiple requests to remove the Republican Jackson sheriff.  RELATED: ‘It’s a cop-out’, attorney says of Gov. Whitmer’s 3rd refusal to fire Jackson County sheriff  Without a recall, resignation or removal from Whitmer, Lillywhite will be sheriff until the end of 2024. Despite Lillywhite’s transgressions, Malone isn’t confident Whitmer will remove the sheriff.  “I’m not holding my breath,” Malone said.  Want more Kalamazoo-area news?

It was unclear Saturday whether the Blendon Township Police Department has adopted a use-of-force continuum policy, which would outline measures that must be exhausted before lethal force can be used.  The video of the Aug. 24 shooting, released Friday, shows Young in her car in a parking space as a police officer orders her to exit the vehicle. A second officer is seen drawing his firearm and stepping in front of the car, despite a department policy advising officers to get out of the way of an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapons.  “Are you going to shoot me?” Young asks, seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the second officer. The officer fires through the windshield and Young’s sedan drifts into the grocery store’s brick wall.  Lawyers for Young’s family say the video is devastating and have called for the officer who shot her to be fired and criminally charged. Blendon police officials have refused to name either of the officers involved.  Here is a look at law enforcement policies on moving vehicles:  PHOTOS: Fatal police shooting of pregnant Ohio woman raises concerns over firing at moving vehicles  What about firing at moving cars?  The New York City Police Department was among the first to bar officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting that killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car led to protests.  Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s found the policy, along with a handful of other use-of-force restrictions, led to a decline in bystanders being shot and suspects dying in police shootings.  Other law enforcement agencies have over the decades followed NYPD’s lead, and industry organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended the restrictions, saying shooting in such circumstances creates an unacceptable risk to bystanders from stray gunfire or the driver losing control of the vehicle if shot.  The Blendon Township department’s policy states: “An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.”  But as of June only 32 police departments in the 100 largest U.S. cities had some form of restriction on firing at moving vehicles, according to Campaign Zero, an advocacy group of academics, activists and others seeking to end police brutality.

Police blocked Johnson near 19th Avenue and Florida Street, where he allegedly pulled out a pistol and started shooting at the officers, the sheriff’s office said. Three Longview police officers fired back, hitting and killing Johnson. No officers were harmed in the exchange. Investigators recovered a 9mm pistol with no serial number. Law enforcement said it was an illegally manufactured “ghost gun.” The Lower Columbia Major Crimes Team is investigating the shooting. The officers involved in the shooting have not been identified. – Austin De Dios; adedios@oregonian.com; @austindedios; 503-319-9744 Our journalism needs your support.

Activistâs toddler is at center of LAPD Commission controversy,9/3/23,2023-09-04T02:04:47Z,en,latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-03/activists-toddler-at-the-center-of-lapd-commission-controversy,https://web.archive.org/web/20230904020447id_/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-03/activists-toddler-at-the-center-of-lapd-commission-controversy,https://web.archive.org/web/20230904020447/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-03/activists-toddler-at-the-center-of-lapd-commission-controversy,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGxhdGltZXMpL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEvc3RvcnkvMjAyMy0wOS0wMy9hY3RpdmlzdHMtdG9kZGxlci1hdC10aGUtY2VudGVyLW9mLWxhcGQtY29tbWlzc2lvbi1jb250cm92ZXJzeQ~~,"Activistâs toddler is at center of LAPD Commission controversy For months, activist Jason Reedy has been bringing his 14-month-old son to weekly meetings of the Los Angeles Police Commission. But the toddlerâs playful romps at the oversight panel have recently become serious business. One commissioner, a frequent target of Reedyâs demands for greater police accountability, said during one Tuesday morning meeting it âmade him sickâ Reedy would bring his son to the emotionally charged meetings. Weeks later, LAPD Chief Michel Moore suggested that Reedy was using his child as a shield from criticism. The unsolicited parenting advice didnât go over well with many of those who attend the meetings. âThe commission seems more intent on enforcing the rules for people who attend their meetings than they are on enforcing the rules on police officers who commit acts of violence on the job,â Reedy said. Reedy has been a regular at commission and City Council meetings, along with other outspoken police critics and social justice advocates who show up to criticize what they see as the panelâs willingness to go along with whatever the department wants. Reedy, who is Black, said he has no doubt that heâs being singled out because of his race, as well as his unflinching criticism of police violence and misconduct. He and other regular meeting attendees argue that the commissionâs rules for public comment arenât applied evenly. Commissioners try to stick to the three-minute time limit allotted to every speaker, but seem far quicker to cut off critics of the department than those who support the police, they argue. And, they say, certain speakers are allowed to espouse racist, misogynistic or xenophobic views without being admonished. Steve Soboroff, a longtime commissioner who recently termed out of the position, said in a recent interview that he stands by his comments at an April meeting that it made him âsickâ to see Reedy bring his child and then shouting expletives at commission members. âDonât tell me if I see something like that going on, that I canât call it out because Iâm a police commissioner. Fire me, then,â he said. âIf you think that standing there and screaming and the language, getting right in copsâ faces all the time, if you think that isnât damaging to a little baby, you are wrong.â He said that his comments were prompted by Reedyâs confrontational, in-your-face style, and said it had nothing to do with Reedyâs ethnicity. The council member said in a statement that he was assaulted. Activists said De LeÃ³n was the aggressor. âI called him out on it, and then he said I was a racist, but I couldnât see all the way back there,â he said, referring to the back of the room where Reedy was standing during the meeting. âDonât ask me, get some people from Child Services to come sit in those meetings, to see what theyâll say.â Another commissioner, attorney William Briggs, who has in the past asked Reedy and others to sit, also questioned whether itâs appropriate to bring young children to the meetings, where âinvective, derogatory language and yelling is used.â He wondered about âthe effects that would have a on a child.â âAs for activists coming to meetings, they have every right to do so, and voice their opinions on everything we discussed,â Briggs said. âI understand that.â Police Commission meetings have never been short on drama. Over the years, the proceedings have drawn a diverse cast of characters, from grieving mothers of people who have been shot by police to a man who wears clothes adorned with a swastika. Department officials say that outbursts from activists have gotten more regular and disruptive in recent years, to the point that it has become nearly impossible for commissioners to carry out their business. The concerns have arisen as a younger generation of activists has opted for more confrontational tactics, such as showing up at the homes of politicians, judges and school board members to get their message across. In 2015, the commission tried to implement rules that threatened expulsion for anyone who make ârepetitious, personal, impertinent or profane remarks.â But the panel later reversed course after the proposal drew a torrent of criticism, including from the American Civil Liberties Union. âYour life isnât going to be funâ: Activists bring protests to L.A. officialsâ homes Since the coronavirus outbreak began, a growing number of L.A. public officials have seen their homes become the target of protesters. Under the current guidelines, attendees are afforded one warning for being disruptive before they can be removed from the meeting. Signs are banned. Speakers are instructed to stick to the agenda items from the meeting or policing matters in general, and not to make personal attacks on other attendees. Standing isnât allowed, with the exception of credentialed members of the media. There was renewed debate about the rules at the commission meeting last week, when several speakers criticized a string of recent police shootings. At one point, the commissionâs president, Erroll Southers, admonished Reedy for standing up. Reedy snapped back that he was tending to his son, who had wandered away from his seat. After the 45-minute public comment period, several people in the audience argued for more time, pointing out that earlier this year a commissioner had promised that everyone who attends the meetings in person would have a chance to speak. After some back and forth, they were told to leave the room, leading some to shout profanities and insults at commissioners as they were escorted out by officers. After the room was cleared, Moore said he wanted to express his frustration with such disruptions from âextremist voices,â which he said undermine the activistsâ arguments. âTheir ability or willingness to escalate those tactics, as was demonstrated here today, including the use of a child, in my view is not a successful path,â Moore said, apparently referring to Reedy. At the following weekâs meeting, a number of audience members stood up during public comment, in defiance of the commissionâs rule. Activist parents have been bringing their children to protests and rallies for varying causes for decades. But some have reconsidered that approach in recent years in light of the âlarge-scale surveillanceâ by law enforcement at such gatherings, according to Safiya Noble, a professor at UCLA in the departments of gender studies and African American studies. âIâm aware that anybody who goes to any protest is likely to be scanned with facial recognition software, and so I donât know how kids could be precluded from that,â she said. Hamid Khan, an organizer with the watchdog group Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, said he heard the chiefâs comments later on a recording of the meeting, calling them âjust completely vulgar and gross commentary.â Mooreâs words, he said, fit a pattern of officials trying to stifle and undermine critical views. âWhat heâs trying to do is to discredit he messenger and to shift the focus on the ground, thatâs his game,â said Khan, who himself has been escorted out of several commission meetings for speaking out. Khan acknowledged there is some theatricality to such tactics, but it can ensure that commissioners pay attention because they are sometimes on their phones during the public comment period or seem otherwise distracted. âItâs a way of expressing your pain and about expressing your trauma, and so people scream,â he said. âThis whole notion that we should just be sitting there silently, just like go up and speak for three minutes knowing that nothingâs going to happen, knowing that nobodyâs really listening to us â¦ people have to take other actions as well.â The chiefâs comments smack of respectability politics, Reedy said. Instead of responding to the very real concerns raised by community members, leaders like Moore hide behind the facade of civility, he said. âFâ decorum, first and foremost,â he said. âFive people are dying every day on the streets. So if elected officials donât want people outside of their homes, then maybe they should be doing something about it. Maybe they should do something about the fact that [police] havenât sustained a racial bias complaint in ... years.â He said his decision to bring along his toddler has everything to do with the fact that Reedy is his caregiver while his partner is at work and on the commissionâs insistence on holding its meetings in the middle of the day. âTo Moore, my child is a pawn and this is all a game,â he said. âThey use children for PR all the time, and I donât use my child.

Fatal police shooting of pregnant Ohio woman raises concerns over firing at moving vehicles,9/3/23,2023-09-05T02:43:56Z,en,newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/fatal-police-shooting-of-pregnant-ohio-woman-raises-concerns-over-firing-at-moving-vehicles-n6g60dxf,https://web.archive.org/web/20230905024356id_/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/fatal-police-shooting-of-pregnant-ohio-woman-raises-concerns-over-firing-at-moving-vehicles-n6g60dxf,https://web.archive.org/web/20230905024356/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/fatal-police-shooting-of-pregnant-ohio-woman-raises-concerns-over-firing-at-moving-vehicles-n6g60dxf,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG5ld3NkYXkpL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uL2ZhdGFsLXBvbGljZS1zaG9vdGluZy1vZi1wcmVnbmFudC1vaGlvLXdvbWFuLXJhaXNlcy1jb25jZXJucy1vdmVyLWZpcmluZy1hdC1tb3ZpbmctdmVoaWNsZXMtbjZnNjBkeGY~,"Fatal police shooting of pregnant Ohio woman raises concerns over firing at moving vehicles Body camera video of the fatal police shooting of Ta'Kiya Young, a 21-year-old pregnant mother in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, has raised questions about how an allegation of shoplifting led to a bullet being fired through her windshield. It was unclear Saturday whether the Blendon Township Police Department has adopted a use-of-force continuum policy, which would outline measures that must be exhausted before lethal force can be used. The video of the Aug. 24 shooting, released Friday, shows Young in her car in a parking space as a police officer orders her to exit the vehicle. A second officer is seen drawing his firearm and stepping in front of the car, despite a department policy advising officers to get out of the way of an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapon. âAre you going to shoot me?â Young asks, seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the second officer. The officer fires through the windshield and Youngâs sedan drifts into the grocery storeâs brick wall. Lawyers for Youngâs family say the video is devastating and have called for the officer who shot her to be fired and criminally charged. Blendon police officials have refused to name either of the officers involved. Here is a look at law enforcement policies on moving vehicles: WHAT ABOUT FIRING AT MOVING CARS? The New York City Police Department was among the first to bar officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting that killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car led to protests. Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s found the policy, along with a handful of other use-of-force restrictions, led to a decline in bystanders being shot and suspects dying in police shootings. Other law enforcement agencies have over the decades followed NYPD's lead, and industry organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended the restrictions, saying shooting in such circumstances creates an unacceptable risk to bystanders from stray gunfire or the driver losing control of the vehicle if shot. The Blendon Township departmentâs policy states: âAn officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.â But as of June only 32 police departments in the 100 largest U.S. cities had some form of restriction on firing at moving vehicles, according to Campaign Zero, an advocacy group of academics, activists and others seeking to end police brutality. HOW ARE SUCH POLICIES INTERPRETED AND ENFORCED? John P. Gross of the University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about the challenges of ending police shooting at moving vehicles, said individual department policies sometimes include exceptions if a suspect is firing a weapon or if the car is being used as a weapon against an officer, though many restrictions specifically say other weapons must be present. Prosecutors and internal police investigators often focus on the moment of use of force, but a broader view is necessary, he said. For example if an officer already has a license plate number, that may be a reason not to use force to stop a vehicle, since âmost of us are findable.â âIf you are pursuing someone accused of a homicide and who has shot at officers in the past, thatâs a different situation than somebody who might have shoplifted $50 worth of items,â Gross said. âThat context should be part of this.â Departments often donât enforce the policies with meaningful discipline in part because of the strength of police unions, Gross said. In Blendon Township, union officials have said Youngâs car became a weapon the moment it began moving. SHOULD OFFICERS PURPOSELY MOVE IN FRONT OF VEHICLES? Many department policies advise officers to move out of the way. But in the Ohio video, an officer is seen drawing his firearm and putting himself in the path of Young's parked car, which Gross called âbad tactics.â âAnd oftentimes bad tactics translates to needing to use more force than was necessary,"" Gross said. ""The officer shouldnât put himself in front of the car. He canât stop the car with his body.â Edward Obayashi, a national use-of-force expert and attorney who specializes in vehicle-related police shootings, agreed and said the officer went against his training. âThe best practice in these matters nationwide is that you do not put yourself in a position of danger,â Obayashi said. ""There was no urgent need for him to position himself the way he did.â Gross also questioned why the officer drew his firearm when the issue at hand was a shoplifting allegation. He urged changes to police training. âThey are taught that if someone is resisting even verbally, that person is going to fight or flee,â Gross said. âThat just ties resistance to a threat. Training teaches officers that there is danger around every corner and threats are everywhere.â"

The Israeli police said 27 officers were injured in the clashes, and at least three protesters were shot by police firing live rounds after they felt “real danger to their lives.”  Israeli police in riot gear and on horses tried to corral the protesters, who broke through barricades and hurled chunks of sidewalk, batteries and rocks at the police.  Similarly violent protests have popped up all over the world as Eritrea, one of the world’s most repressive countries, marks 30 years of independence with festivals held by Eritrea’s diaspora across Europe and North America. Earlier this year, Eritrea called anti-government protesters marching against these events “asylum scum.”  Eritreans make up the majority of the more than 30,000 African asylum-seekers in Israel. They say they fled danger and persecution from a country known as the “North Korea of Africa” with forced lifetime military conscription in slavery-like conditions.  President Isaias Afwerki, 77, has led Eritrea since 1993, taking power after the country won independence from Ethiopia in a long guerrilla war. There have been no elections, there’s no free media and exit visas are required. Many young people are forced into military service with no end date, human rights groups and United Nations experts say.  The nation on the Horn of Africa has one of the world’s worst human rights records, and the asylum-seekers fear death if they were to return.  PHOTOS: Dozens injured in a protest by asylum-seekers outside Eritrean Embassy in Israel  In Israel, they face an uncertain future as the state has attempts to deport them. But despite the struggle to stay, in often squalid conditions, many say they enjoy some freedoms they never would have at home - like the right to protest."

Hwang, whose six-decade-long journalism career included 30 years chronicling South Koreaâs tumultuous modern history for The Associated Press, including as Seoul bureau chief, has died at age 99. Hwang died Thursday of chronic ailments after undergoing kidney dialysis for two years, his son, Yoon Chul Hwang, said. From joining the AP in 1957, Hwang witnessed and reported on some of South Koreaâs most dramatic and turbulent moments in its postwar history, from a public uprising that toppled the countryâs first president, military coups and a presidential assassination to pro-democracy movements. âIt was rare luck for a journalist to cover all these historical events in a single country,â Hwang wrote in a 2006 book titled âKorea Witness,â a collection of essays and articles by Korea correspondents. Hwang chose the 1960 uprising â where massive student protests over the governmentâs election fraud and corruption allegations triggered bloody police crackdowns before President Syngman Rhee resigned â as âthe most shocking, dramatic and nerve-rackingâ event that he had ever covered. While covering some of the protests on the ground, Hwang said he beat his foreign media competitors when he dashed to a tearoom to use a phone there to relay the news of police shooting at demonstrators to an AP colleague at the office, who filed a bulletin. âI was faster than other foreign journalists. The story was moved via our Tokyo bureau. … It touched off immense world reaction,â Hwang said in an interview with South Koreaâs Maeil Business Newspaper last year. A year after Rhee’s ouster, Maj. Gen. Park Chung-hee seized power in a coup. He then ruled the country with an iron-fist for 18 years. Under Park, freedom of expression and of the press were significantly hurt. In the book âKorea Witness,â Hwang said that intelligence and police officers frequently visited the APâs Seoul office and pushed him and his Korean colleagues to be âpatriotic.” After Park was gunned down by his spy chief in 1979, Chun Doo-hwan, also an army major general, launched a coup and took power. On an early morning in July 1980, Hwang said that agents from Chunâs martial law command came to his house, blindfolded him and took him to an interrogation facility in a military jeep. Over three days, Hwang was interrogated intensively over his ties to opposition leader Kim Dae-jung. He was eventually released. During Park and Chunâs rules, foreign media journalists still received less harsh treatment by authorities than their counterparts working at local media. Opposition politicians sought to use Western media outlets in Seoul as channels to relay their fight for democracy to the world. âForeign journalists were relatively freer from government crackdown or censorships … so my father was proud of the fact that he wrote about the situation more accurately than Korean media reporters,â said Hwangâs son. The younger Hwang said aides to opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung often visited his father at their house. Both Kims later became presidents after South Korea achieved democracy in the late 1980s. After leaving the AP in 1987, Hwang worked for Time magazine’s Seoul bureau for five years then worked freelance for other Western media companies. He ended his professional career as a foreign media journalist in 2002, after reporting on a World Cup opening ceremony for CBS. A few years later, Hwang began regularly posting articles in Korean on various issues on a local online site. He had continued contributing articles to the site until he was hospitalized recently. In an article posted this February, Hwang said he had been writing a diary every night for 20 years. âWhile being hospitalized, my father worried about a deadline approaching for his turn to write and post an article,â his son said. Hwang is survived by his son and four daughters. Hwang’s mourning station set up at a Seoul hospital is to run until early Sunday morning."
2 families grieve teens’ deaths from a deputy’s gun: ‘They did not deserve to die’,9/2/23,2023-09-09T04:38:32Z,en,syracuse.com,https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/09/2-families-grieve-teens-deaths-from-a-deputys-gun-they-did-not-deserve-to-die.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230909043832id_/https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/09/2-families-grieve-teens-deaths-from-a-deputys-gun-they-did-not-deserve-to-die.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230909043832/https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/09/2-families-grieve-teens-deaths-from-a-deputys-gun-they-did-not-deserve-to-die.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN5cmFjdXNlKS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDkvMi1mYW1pbGllcy1ncmlldmUtdGVlbnMtZGVhdGhzLWZyb20tYS1kZXB1dHlzLWd1bi10aGV5LWRpZC1ub3QtZGVzZXJ2ZS10by1kaWUuaHRtbA~~,"Syracuse, N.Y. — Adut Mo started cooking at 8 a.m. Tuesday. It was a new dish, and a special dinner for the last night before her little brother, Lueth, started the new school year as a sophomore at Henninger High School. The two ate together in the kitchen of the big yellow house on Syracuse’s North Side. Their father, Domkog, was still working so he ate later. And then he promised his son they’d go back to school shopping after the first day was done. Then everyone said good night. Those were the last words they said to the 15-year-old. Lueth never made it to school. He was shot and killed by an Onondaga County sheriff’s deputy early Wednesday morning. His family friend, 17-year-old Dhal Apet, was also killed. They were in a stolen car in DeWitt that nearly ran over the deputy who responded to a call of suspicious activity, said Onondaga County Sheriff Toby Shelley. Shelley’s office said the evidence shows the deputy, who did not turn on his body-worn camera, had no choice but to shoot at the car. The boys were not driving; they were passengers. The driver has not been identified or found. Police and the families said the driver sped from the scene and ditched the car, with the two dying boys in it. Someone who has not been identified called 911. The fathers and sisters of both teens spoke at length with reporters from Syracuse.com and The Post-Standard Thursday at Lueth’s home. The families, from the same town in South Sudan, have been friends since before the boys were born. Both children were born in the U.S. They come from large families where home is a revolving door because someone is always going to work and coming home from work, regardless of the time of day. Both families said the teens had recently started hanging out with friends who concerned them. Lueth’s father said he recently forbade his son from being with friends who were staying out too late and getting into trouble. Dhal’s father and sister said he, too, had some friends the family did not like. But neither boy had ever been in serious trouble, the families said. And neither was ever involved in anything violent. Mostly, the families said, they were normal teenage boys who made bad choices sometimes, but nothing that ever would have foreshadowed their deaths in a police shooting. “They did not deserve to die,” Ajak Apet said. The families that came to Syracuse from a war-torn country to build better lives are searching for answers as hard as they are grieving. The sheriff’s office has told them very little. The state Attorney General’s Office, which is investigating the shooting, had not reached out to either family by Thursday, the families said. A first day that never came Lueth’s father went into his room around 6:30 a.m., before he got in his car to take a family friend to school. That family lives too far for the daughter to walk, so Domkog drives her. Sometimes, Lueth comes, but sometimes he walks. Domkog figured his son was walking to Henninger. He left to take the other child to school. When he returned, there was a crime scene just down the street on Mooney Avenue. He was curious but not worried. What he didn’t know was his son Lueth was there, dying in the stolen car. His family friend’s son Dhal was already dead. The driver, likely a friend of the boys, ditched the car. Police have not identified the driver and he has not been found. Around 9 a.m., Adut got a text saying the boys were missing. Then a call with more specific news: They were dead. Adut and Domkog ran down their street to the crime scene. They tried to see, to ask questions. They waited for two hours but got no information. So they went to the hospital. There they learned it was all true. Lueth had been shot and killed. He was pronounced dead after they brought him in. By the time they got there, his body had been taken to the medical examiner’s office, they said. The boy who had once wanted to be a police officer, who geeked out playing Fortnite with a light-up keyboard, was gone. In the void were so many questions. Adut spent her afternoon trying to piece together her brother’s last hours from media reports. Dhal’s sister, Ajak Apet, and their father, Pothwei Bangoshoth, went down to the crime scene after they heard the news of his death from a friend. They stood there for hours. They could see there was a body there; he was sure it was his son. But no one would confirm it. Deputies would not tell them what had happened. Pothwei and Ajak said Dhal had been running with people who made them worry lately. And he stopped making the artful videos that he used to spend hours perfecting. He was not perfect, but he was a generous kid who was growing up. Until this school year, Pothwei worked in Henninger. He knew his son’s friends and their teachers. He sat in on a disciplinary chat with Dhal and the gym teacher last year. Dhal had been mouthing off, his father said. The gym teacher and his father told him it had better not happen again. The teen apologized and smiled sheepishly when he got up to leave. He was a kid who wanted criticism when he had done wrong, his father said. “When I think about that smile, I cry,” Pothwei said. Families overwhelmed by questions More than 24 hours after the boys’ deaths, the families want to know how the injured boys got over to the Mooney Avenue scene – just a block away from Lueth’s home – and whether the deputy was searching for the boys he had just fired at. The sheriff’s office said the shooting was part of a string of events that began Tuesday night around 9 p.m. That’s when two cars, a Hyundai and a Kia, were stolen near James and Hixson Avenue in Syracuse. Those cars were connected to two smoke shop burglaries: one at 4 a.m. in the city of Oneida and one at a smoke shop in DeWitt. The cars were spotted again by a 911 caller at 6:18 a.m., who called to say there were suspicious people in the Midler Meadows Mobile Home Park. That’s where the Hyundai drove at the deputy, the sheriff said, and where the deputy fired into the car and hit the two boys. The car fled and eventually crashed on Mooney Avenue just before 7 a.m. one block away from Lueth’s home. Ajak also asked why the passengers were hit by the bullets, when they had no control over where the car was going. Like many others, the families also want to know why the deputy did not turn on his body camera as soon as he arrived at the call in DeWitt. Pothwei said that if the deputy was on duty answering a call, he should have turned it on before the interaction began. “Why wasn’t that turned on while he was on duty?” Pothwei said. Pothwei also wants to know why the deputy could shoot at all of the teens if they were not armed. The families also don’t know who called 911 on Mooney Avenue to report the boys had been shot long after the shots were fired in DeWitt. As they sit on the steamy porch of Leuth’s home on Mooney Avenue, family and friends stream in and out of the door to pay respects, to bring food, and to wonder. They know so little, the questions are endless: Are the boys being blamed for the burglaries? What about the other car police mentioned? But more than anything, perhaps, they want to know why their sons were shot in the DeWitt mobile home park. What happened between the 911 call for suspicious people and the deputy firing three shots at the car? The sheriff said the department has video from a nearby homeowner that shows the car driving toward the officer. The video justifies the fatal shots the deputy fired, the sheriff said. But he has not made the footage public. Ajak and Adut, both in their 20s, have been trying to defend their brothers and families against the vitriol on social media. Ajak said that no one knows for sure what role her brother and Leuth played in the events over the 10 hours from the car theft to the shooting. Now the boys will never have a chance to defend themselves or their actions that day, they said. “Nothing justifies anybody (getting) killed,” Adut said. Pothwei, who grew up in South Sudan and came to Syracuse when he was in his 30s, said it is hard to know what he needed to protect his son from. He quit his job this year to stay home and be around more for his kids. He handed in his keys the day before his son was killed.

Hwang, AP correspondent in Seoul for 30 years, dies at age 99 K.C. Hwang, whose six-decade-long journalism career included 30 years chronicling South Korea’s tumultuous modern history for The Associated Press, including as Seoul bureau chief, has died at age 99. Hwang died Thursday of chronic ailments after undergoing kidney dialysis for two years, his son, Yoon Chul Hwang, said. From joining the AP in 1957, Hwang witnessed and reported on some of South Korea’s most dramatic and turbulent moments in its postwar history, from a public uprising that toppled the country’s first president, military coups and a presidential assassination to pro-democracy movements. “It was rare luck for a journalist to cover all these historical events in a single country,” Hwang wrote in a 2006 book titled “Korea Witness,” a collection of essays and articles by Korea correspondents. Hwang chose the 1960 uprising — where massive student protests over the government’s election fraud and corruption allegations triggered bloody police crackdowns before President Syngman Rhee resigned — as “the most shocking, dramatic and nerve-racking” event that he had ever covered. While covering some of the protests on the ground, Hwang said he beat his foreign media competitors when he dashed to a tearoom to use a phone there to relay the news of police shooting at demonstrators to an AP colleague at the office, who filed a bulletin. “I was faster than other foreign journalists. The story was moved via our Tokyo bureau. ... It touched off immense world reaction,” Hwang said in an interview with South Korea’s Maeil Business Newspaper last year. A year after Rhee’s ouster, Maj. Gen. Park Chung-hee seized power in a coup. He then ruled the country with an iron-fist for 18 years. Under Park, freedom of expression and of the press were significantly hurt. In the book “Korea Witness,” Hwang said that intelligence and police officers frequently visited the AP’s Seoul office and pushed him and his Korean colleagues to be “patriotic.” After Park was gunned down by his spy chief in 1979, Chun Doo-hwan, also an army major general, launched a coup and took power. On an early morning in July 1980, Hwang said that agents from Chun’s martial law command came to his house, blindfolded him and took him to an interrogation facility in a military jeep. Over three days, Hwang was interrogated intensively over his ties to opposition leader Kim Dae-jung. He was eventually released. During Park and Chun’s rules, foreign media journalists still received less harsh treatment by authorities than their counterparts working at local media. Opposition politicians sought to use Western media outlets in Seoul as channels to relay their fight for democracy to the world. “Foreign journalists were relatively freer from government crackdown or censorships ... so my father was proud of the fact that he wrote about the situation more accurately than Korean media reporters,” said Hwang’s son. The younger Hwang said aides to opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung often visited his father at their house. Both Kims later became presidents after South Korea achieved democracy in the late 1980s. After leaving the AP in 1987, Hwang worked for Time magazine’s Seoul bureau for five years then worked freelance for other Western media companies. He ended his professional career as a foreign media journalist in 2002, after reporting on a World Cup opening ceremony for CBS. A few years later, Hwang began regularly posting articles in Korean on various issues on a local online site. He had continued contributing articles to the site until he was hospitalized recently. In an article posted this February, Hwang said he had been writing a diary every night for 20 years. “While being hospitalized, my father worried about a deadline approaching for his turn to write and post an article,” his son said. Hwang is survived by his son and four daughters. Hwang’s mourning station set up at a Seoul hospital is to run until early Sunday morning.

It was unclear Saturday whether the Blendon Township Police Department has adopted a use-of-force continuum policy, which would outline measures that must be exhausted before lethal force can be used. The video of the Aug. 24 shooting, released Friday, shows Young in her car in a parking space as a police officer orders her to exit the vehicle. A second officer is seen drawing his firearm and stepping in front of the car, despite a department policy advising officers to get out of the way of an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapon. “Are you going to shoot me?” Young asks, seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the second officer. The officer fires through the windshield and Young’s sedan drifts into the grocery store’s brick wall. Lawyers for Young’s family say the video is devastating and have called for the officer who shot her to be fired and criminally charged. Blendon police officials have refused to name either of the officers involved. Here is a look at law enforcement policies on moving vehicles: WHAT ABOUT FIRING AT MOVING CARS? The New York City Police Department was among the first to bar officers from firing at or from moving vehicles after a 1972 shooting that killed a 10-year-old passenger in a stolen car led to protests. Researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s found the policy, along with a handful of other use-of-force restrictions, led to a decline in bystanders being shot and suspects dying in police shootings. Other law enforcement agencies have over the decades followed NYPD’s lead, and industry organizations such as the Police Executive Research Forum and the International Association of Chiefs of Police have recommended the restrictions, saying shooting in such circumstances creates an unacceptable risk to bystanders from stray gunfire or the driver losing control of the vehicle if shot. The Blendon Township department’s policy states: “An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.” But as of June only 32 police departments in the 100 largest U.S. cities had some form of restriction on firing at moving vehicles, according to Campaign Zero, an advocacy group of academics, activists and others seeking to end police brutality. HOW ARE SUCH POLICIES INTERPRETED AND ENFORCED? John P. Gross of the University of Wisconsin Law School, who has written about the challenges of ending police shooting at moving vehicles, said individual department policies sometimes include exceptions if a suspect is firing a weapon or if the car is being used as a weapon against an officer, though many restrictions specifically say other weapons must be present. Prosecutors and internal police investigators often focus on the moment of use of force, but a broader view is necessary, he said. For example if an officer already has a license plate number, that may be a reason not to use force to stop a vehicle, since “most of us are findable.” “If you are pursuing someone accused of a homicide and who has shot at officers in the past, that’s a different situation than somebody who might have shoplifted $50 worth of items,” Gross said. “That context should be part of this.” Departments often don’t enforce the policies with meaningful discipline in part because of the strength of police unions, Gross said. In Blendon Township, union officials have said Young’s car became a weapon the moment it began moving. SHOULD OFFICERS PURPOSELY MOVE IN FRONT OF VEHICLES? Many department policies advise officers to move out of the way. But in the Ohio video, an officer is seen drawing his firearm and putting himself in the path of Young’s parked car, which Gross called “bad tactics.” “And oftentimes bad tactics translates to needing to use more force than was necessary,” Gross said. “The officer shouldn’t put himself in front of the car. He can’t stop the car with his body.” Edward Obayashi, a national use-of-force expert and attorney who specializes in vehicle-related police shootings, agreed and said the officer went against his training. “The best practice in these matters nationwide is that you do not put yourself in a position of danger,” Obayashi said. “There was no urgent need for him to position himself the way he did.” Gross also questioned why the officer drew his firearm when the issue at hand was a shoplifting allegation. He urged changes to police training. “They are taught that if someone is resisting even verbally, that person is going to fight or flee,” Gross said. “That just ties resistance to a threat. Training teaches officers that there is danger around every corner and threats are everywhere.”"

NYPD inspector cleared of George Floyd protest excessive force,9/2/23,2023-09-03T08:15:40Z,en,nydailynews.com,https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nypd-clears-inspector-excessive-force-george-floyd-protest-20230902-dvgilt5gmzgc3d4svc6gdlt2py-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230903081540id_/https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nypd-clears-inspector-excessive-force-george-floyd-protest-20230902-dvgilt5gmzgc3d4svc6gdlt2py-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230903081540/https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nypd-clears-inspector-excessive-force-george-floyd-protest-20230902-dvgilt5gmzgc3d4svc6gdlt2py-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55ZGFpbHluZXdzKS9uZXcteW9yay9ueWMtY3JpbWUvbnktbnlwZC1jbGVhcnMtaW5zcGVjdG9yLWV4Y2Vzc2l2ZS1mb3JjZS1nZW9yZ2UtZmxveWQtcHJvdGVzdC0yMDIzMDkwMi1kdmdpbHQ1Z216Z2MzZDRzdmM2Z2RsdDJweS1zdG9yeS5odG1s,"An NYPD inspector accused of roughing up a George Floyd protester in Brooklyn two years ago was cleared of all departmental charges — but two other officers were found guilty of using excessive force, according to NYPD records. Inspector Jesse Lance testified at his March trial at 1 Police Plaza that Kedwin Payamps and other bicyclists played the role of “obstructionists,” blocking police from doing their job during the June 4, 2020 demonstration in Clinton Hill, at which protesters threw bottles at officers. Lance said his two baton strikes to Payamps’ backpack was the least amount of force possible — not the excessive force he was accused of by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which substantiated Payamps’ allegation and prosecuted the case. Video showed Payamps looking back at Lance on Washington Ave. near Fulton St. as Lance approached to enforce the 8 p.m. curfew and make an arrest. Payamps testified he was pedaling his bike past the protest when Lance confronted him. Soon after that, he said, a group of cops rushed him and arrested him for violating the curfew. The charge was dismissed about a month later. Lance, who was also accused of making misleading statements to the CCRB when he was first interviewed, claimed he couldn’t identify himself in the video. He also said his memory was jogged by reading 1,700 pages of documents about the protest — and by watching the video in question at least 100 times. “But today you remembered?” asked the CCRB prosecutor, Nicole Jardim. “I’m telling you as I see it today,” Lance responded. “Yes, I’m able to deduce and know that happened.” The CCRB called for Lance to lose 30 days vacation pay and be placed on dismissal probation. But that argument didn’t sway NYPD Judge Jeff Adler, who recommended the 24-year veteran be found not guilty. On June 16 then-NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell approved Adler’s recommendation. The findings were disclosed in a quarterly report released by the CCRB on Aug. 21. Payamps, 31, has filed a lawsuit against the NYPD. He and his lawyer refused comment. Lawyer Lou La Pietra said the charges in the Floyd protest incident were “exaggerated” and that Sewell made the right decision in finding Lance not guilty. “It was based on common sense and the proper application of Police Department rules and law,” La Pietra said. “Inspector Lance did nothing wrong and he was rightfully found not guilty.” It was the second time Lance, assigned to a housing command in Brooklyn, was acquitted at a department trial. In 2019, he was tried and cleared in a case that grew from an accusation that he barged into a Brooklyn apartment and accosted a family following a shooting outside their building, according to NYPD records. Detective Corey Johnson, another police officer who worked the George Floyd protest in Clinton Hill, was found guilty of using force against journalist Nick Pinto, who was then with WNYC Radio. Johnson, who at the time of the protest held the rank of police officer, testified that he was trying to clear the street of protesters when he was caught on camera shoving Pinto, who fell to the ground. He said while he understood those who felt he shoved the journalist “there was no ill intent to hurt Mr. Pinto.” “I was trying to clear that block, that sidewalk,” Johnson testified. Pinto was not hurt. The CCRB wanted Johnson to be docked 25 vacation days. But Adler, the departmental judge, recommended three days for the force allegation. Sewell increased the penalty to five days. Johnson, who joined the NYPD in 2015, was promoted to detective in June and is assigned to the 77th Precinct. He did not respond to a request for comment and his lawyer had no comment. In an incident involving another George Floyd protest in Manhattan’s Union Square on May 30, 2020, Officer Brian Mahon was accused of excessive force, discourtesy and making a false statement to the CCRB. Mahon settled his case, accepting 40 days lost pay and a year’s dismissal probation. The Daily News Flash Mahon was accused of shoving a protester with both hands on his baton, then twice hitting the protester with it. Records show Mahon told the CCRB he swung his baton at a low angle, a tactic designed to clear out a crowd, and that he didn’t hit the protester — but cell phone footage contradicted his contention. Mahon made headlines in 2019 as one of the officers involved in the Bronx friendly fire shooting death of Officer Brian Mulkeen in the Bronx. Armed ex-con Antonio Williams was shot dead by Mulkeen during a life-and-death wrestling match. Five other cops fired 10 shots, with Mahon firing once. An investigation by the Bronx District Attorney’s Office released in 2021 found the officers’ use of their weapons was legally justified. The investigation did not state which officers’ shots killed Mulkeen. Mulkeen’s father is now suing the NYPD, alleging his son’s colleagues were not properly trained. Williams’ family has also sued the city. Mahon, who joined the NYPD in 2013 and is assigned to a Manhattan narcotics command, could not be reached for comment. His lawyer had no comment."

Over three days, Hwang was interrogated intensively over his ties to opposition leader Kim Dae-jung. He was eventually released.

The younger Hwang said aides to opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung often visited his father at their house. Both Kims later became presidents after South Korea achieved democracy in the late 1980s.

Ta’Kiya Young’s family urges officer’s arrest after video shows him killing the pregnant Black woman,9/1/23,2023-09-02T02:21:54Z,en,twincities.com,https://www.twincities.com/2023/09/01/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230902022154id_/https://www.twincities.com/2023/09/01/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230902022154/https://www.twincities.com/2023/09/01/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHR3aW5jaXRpZXMpLzIwMjMvMDkvMDEvdGFraXlhLXlvdW5ncy1mYW1pbHktdXJnZXMtb2ZmaWNlcnMtYXJyZXN0LWFmdGVyLXZpZGVvLXNob3dzLWhpbS1raWxsaW5nLXRoZS1wcmVnbmFudC1ibGFjay13b21hbg~~,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio authorities on Friday released bodycam video showing a police officer fatally shooting Ta’Kiya Young in her car in what her family denounced as a “gross misuse of power and authority” against the pregnant Black mother. Sean Walton, an attorney representing Young’s family, said the video clearly shows that the Aug. 24 shooting of the 21-year-old woman was unjustified and he called for the officer to be fired and charged immediately. Walton also criticized police for not releasing the video footage for more than a week after the shooting. “Ta’Kiya’s family is heartbroken,” Walton said in an interview with The Associated Press. “The video did nothing but confirm their fears that Ta’Kiya was murdered unjustifiably … and it was just heartbreaking for them to see Ta’Kiya having her life taken away under such ridiculous circumstances.” Young’s death follows a troubling series of fatal shootings of Black adults and children by Ohio police and numerous occurrences of police brutality against Black people across the nation in recent years, events that have prompted widespread protests and demands for police reform. The officer who shot Young is on paid administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation examines the shooting, which is standard practice. A police union official said calls to charge the officer before an investigation is complete are premature. A second officer who was on the scene has returned to active duty. Their names, races and ranks have not been released. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford called the shooting a tragedy. “Ms. Young’s family is understandably very upset and grieving,” he said in a written statement released Friday morning. “While none of us can fully understand the depths of their pain, all of us can remember them in our prayers and give them the time and space to deal with this heartbreaking turn of events.” Young’s father, grandmother and other relatives watched the video before its public release and released a statement Friday through Walton. “It is undeniable that Ta’Kiya’s death was not only avoidable, but also a gross misuse of power and authority,” the statement said. While viewing the video, the family felt “a lot of anger, a lot of frustration,” Walton told the AP. “More than anything, there was … a sense of just devastation, to know that this power system, these police officers, could stop her and so quickly take her life for no justifiable reason.” The video shows an officer at the driver’s side window telling Young she has been accused of theft and repeatedly demanding that she get out of the car. A second officer is standing in front of the car. Young protests, and the first officer repeats his demand. Then both officers yell at her to get out. At that point, Young can be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?” seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the officer standing in front of it. The officer fires his gun through the windshield and Young’s sedan drifts into the grocery store’s brick wall. Officers then break the driver’s side window, which Belford said was to get Young out of the car and render medical aid, though footage of medical assistance was not provided. In his interview with the AP on Friday, Walton denied that Young had stolen anything from the grocery store. He said his firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the store. “The bottles were left in the store,” he said. “So when she’s in her car denying that, that’s accurate. She did not commit any theft, and so these officers were not even within their right to place her under arrest, let alone take her life.” Brian Steel, executive vice president of the union representing Blendon Township police, criticized Walton’s characterization of the shooting as murder before all the facts are in. He said an investigation will determine whether the shooting was justified. “The fact is, (the officer) had to make a split-second decision while in front of a moving vehicle, a 2,000-pound weapon,” he said. But Edward Obayashi, a national use-of-force expert and attorney who specializes in vehicle-related police shootings, said that while the officer who shot Young may have reasonably feared for his safety, it went against all his law enforcement training to be in front of her car in the first place. “The best practice in these matters nationwide is that you do not put yourself in a position of danger,” said Obayashi, especially given that it was a minor crime Young was being accused of. “The results are predictable. … Based on your training, why are you going to put yourself in front of a vehicle, in front of an individual that does not want to cooperate?” Obayashi said. “There was no urgent need for him to position himself the way he did.” The Blendon Township police department’s use of force policy states that officers should try to move away from an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapons. An officer should only shoot when he or she “reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.” Responding to criticism of the delay in releasing the video, Belford said it took time for his small staff to process it and properly redact certain footage, such as officers’ faces and badge numbers, in accordance with Ohio law. He said the officers’ names cannot be released at this point because they are being treated as assault victims. He said one of the officer’s arms was still partially in the driver’s side window and a second officer was still standing in front of the car when Young moved the car forward. Young’s death is one of numerous deaths of Black adults and children at the hands of police across the nation that have drawn protests and demands for more accountability. Among the most prominent cases was George Floyd’s death on May 25, 2020. Floyd died after then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder. In Ohio, Donovan Lewis was lying on his bed in August 2022 when he was shot by a K-9 officer serving a warrant. Ma’Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old girl in foster care who was accused of swinging at two people with a knife, was fatally shot in April 2021. In December 2020, Casey Goodson Jr., was shot five times in the back by a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy. Ohio Families Unite for Political Action and Change, a grassroots organization focused on eradicating police brutality, said the footage of Young’s shooting shows officers’ conduct was “violent, defenseless, and egregious” and that they acted as “judge, jury and executioner.” Young was expected to give birth to a daughter in November. Family and friends held a private vigil a day after Young was killed, releasing balloons and lighting candles spelling out “RIP Kiya.” An online effort to pay her funeral expenses has raised over $7,000. Ta’Kiya’s siblings, cousins, grandmother and father have rallied around her sons, 6-year-old Ja’Kobie and 3-year-old Ja’Kenlie, who don’t yet understand the magnitude of what happened to their mother, Walton said. “It’s a large family and Ta’Kiya has been snatched away from them,” Walton said. “I think the entire family is still in shock.” Young’s grandmother, Nadine Young, described her granddaughter as a family-oriented prankster who was a loving older sister and mother. “She was so excited to have this little girl,” the grandmother said at a news conference Wednesday. “She has her two little boys, but she was so fired up to have this girl. She is going to be so missed.” “I’m a mess because it’s just tragic,” she said, “but it should have never, ever, ever happened.” ___ Associated Press writers Aaron Morrison in New York; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania; and video journalist Patrick Orsagos in Columbus contributed to this report. ___ Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Kweli Murphy Al-Mateen, 17, of Baltimore, was killed in the Oct. 8 crash, according the Maryland Attorney General’s Office. Al-Mateen was driving the car that fled, according to a declination report posted online by Baltimore prosecutors, which did not identify him by name. No other people in the crash suffered life-threatening injuries. In the report, prosecutors concluded that officers Cesar Gonzalez and Cierra Thurmond did not “chase” the car prior to the fatal crash and that there is no “legal causation” between their actions and Al-Mateen’s death. “The actions of the Involved Citizen were the overwhelming primary factor in the cause of his own death,” the report said. According to the narrative laid out by the State’s Attorney’s Office, Gonzalez and Thurmond were patrolling in the Northwestern District, when they saw a black Honda CRV facing the wrong direction on the street. They approached, making a U-turn, and began to follow the car. The officers did not turn on their lights or sirens, according to the report. They followed the black SUV, staying between a half block and three blocks away. They also called for assistance from the helicopter unit, Foxtrot. [ https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/bs-md-attorney-general-police-shooting-prosecutions-20230726-tclmu3opazbfnghtr577ipty6i-story.html ] At the intersection of Grantley Road and Liberty Heights Avenue, Al-Mateen drove through a stop sign at high speed and caused a four-car collision, the report said. Gonzalez and Thurmond were roughly three blocks behind, it said. “We never even got a chance to stop him,” Gonzalez said in a recorded statement captured by his body camera that is included in the prosecutors’ report. “He saw us banging, we requested Fox.” A third Baltimore Police officer saw the black CRV parked the wrong way and saw it pull off quickly. He didn’t follow the other officers, who were following the car. He arrived at the crash site shortly afterward, having taken a different route. One witness told police that a police vehicle passed his house roughly 30 seconds after the black Honda SUV, and that the police car turned its lights on after the crash. Another witness estimated the police were about three seconds behind the black SUV, which he said drove through a stop sign outside his home. A third witness called the Attorney General’s Office to say the police car arrived 20 to 30 seconds after the crash: “In my opinion, the police were not chasing him,” the witness said. Breaking News Alerts Baltimore prosecutors concluded the interaction between police and Al-Mateen did not qualify as a vehicle pursuit. Prosecutors wrote that the officers didn’t have lights or sirens activated and they requested aerial survillance — which they say suggests they were “merely attempting to maintain a safe distance until Foxtrot could help locate the suspect vehicle which had committed misdemeanor traffic offenses.” The State’s Attorney’s Office noted the officers may have exceeded 25 miles per hour and failed to stop at stop signs. But, it continues, neither of those “prove a ‘pursuit.’” “In hindsight, it appears to be a prudent decision by the Involved Officers not to engage in a vehicle pursuit,” prosecutors wrote. [ Local prosecutors have not charged officers in any of the police-involved death investigations completed by Maryland attorney general’s office ] The prosecutors’ report added that police did not engage in conduct that resulted in Al-Mateen’s death: “While reasonable minds can conclude that the Involved Citizen would not have driven the way he drove but for the police officers turning around and — at a distance — following him, this conclusion ignores completely the fact that he, the Involved Citizen, is the primary cause of the accident regardless of what the officers did, or didn’t, do.” The attorney general’s Independent Investigations Division, charged with investigating fatal interactions with police statewide, sent an interim report to the State’s Attorney’s Office on March 24, according to a website for the unit. That investigative team’s report has not yet been released.

State supreme court calls Baltimore Police’s rejection of a public records fee waiver ‘arbitrary and capricious’,9/1/23,2023-09-02T02:28:43Z,en,baltimoresun.com,https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-transparency-force-investigations-fee-waiver-20230901-xtjbxy7kebbslabaavqrxjtqlm-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230902022843id_/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-transparency-force-investigations-fee-waiver-20230901-xtjbxy7kebbslabaavqrxjtqlm-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230902022843/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-transparency-force-investigations-fee-waiver-20230901-xtjbxy7kebbslabaavqrxjtqlm-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bikvbWFyeWxhbmQvYmFsdGltb3JlLWNpdHkvYnMtbWQtY2ktYmFsdGltb3JlLXBvbGljZS10cmFuc3BhcmVuY3ktZm9yY2UtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMtZmVlLXdhaXZlci0yMDIzMDkwMS14dGpieHk3a2ViYnNsYWJhYXZxcnhqdHFsbS1zdG9yeS5odG1s,"Baltimore Police improperly rejected a nonprofit’s request to waive the cost of producing investigative records that it requested from the agency, the Maryland Supreme Court found this week. In a first-of-its-kind case, the state’s highest court found unanimously that, before denying the so-called “fee waiver” requested by Open Justice Baltimore, Baltimore Police should have considered whether the requested records would shed light on public controversy and whether a complete denial of the waiver would “exacerbate” any public controversy. The court, calling the agency’s decision “arbitrary and capricious,” ordered Baltimore Police to reconsider the fee waiver request. Baltimore Police referred a reporter’s questions to the city law department, which issued a statement through a spokesperson. The statement said that the Supreme Court “only” remanded the matter to BPD to “more fully document” consideration of the factors first articulated in a 2021 appellate opinion, which was issued after BPD’s decision in this case. The law department added that it believes BPD’s current procedure for analyzing fee waiver requests “meets the documentation requirements described in yesterday’s opinion.” “We greatly appreciate the new guidance that the Supreme Court has provided to trial courts and requestors, as we believe it will significantly reduce meritless litigation,” the law department said. “As this issue remains in active litigation, we reserve further comment for the appropriate judicial forum.” [ How much should public records cost the public? Dispute over Baltimore Police price tag reaches state supreme court. ] At issue in the case are completed internal investigations into officers’ most serious use-of-force cases. Baltimore Police first gave a price for the records of more than $1 million, later reduced to about $245,000. Open Justice Baltimore, the community organization that sought the records under the Maryland Public Information Act, wrote in 2020 that the records would serve as a step toward trust through transparency. It cited the agency’s history of corruption and violence, pointing to the 2016 U.S. Department of Justice report, the Gun Trace Task Force and police shootings. “Ongoing secrecy continues suspicion,” wrote Matthew Zernhelt, who represents Open Justice Baltimore. State law allows records custodians to waive the cost of fulfilling public records requests if the requester cannot afford to pay the fee, or if waiving the fee would be in the “public interest.” Baltimore Police, however, rejected Open Justice’s fee waiver request, providing little justification at the time. Now, years later, the group will get another chance to secure the records. “It took four years for us to fight BPD, for them to do what they should have been doing in the first place,” Zernhelt said Friday. “This is not what it should take to get BPD to fulfill their job. When BPD is able to keep misconduct in the shadows, it only harms the community.” [ Baltimore County will let police first review requested disciplinary records and challenge their release, worrying Anton’s Law advocates ] The Supreme Court decision largely knocked down the four-pronged justification for the fee waiver rejection provided by Baltimore Police in court records. The agency had said that Open Justice Baltimore’s public interest justification was too vague and general; that the records wouldn’t contribute to the public’s understanding because they would be redundant or unclear with redactions; that the community organization could pay or didn’t prove it couldn’t; and that fulfilling the request would be too costly and burdensome for the short-staffed police department. In response, the Supreme Court found the public interest purpose was apparent, not vague. It said it was unpersuaded that the information in the investigative files would be redundant, as it would give the public a unique opportunity to “determine for itself” whether police were complying with their own policies. It wasn’t satisfied by the argument that redactions would hinder the public’s understanding without evidence. And it said the cost to Baltimore Police of producing the records did not alone make the fee waiver rejection “reasonable.” Rather, the state’s highest court argued, the public interest purpose that would be served in releasing the investigative files sought by Open Justice Baltimore was “plainly apparent.” And, it went on, given existing controversies, police should have weighed whether its complete denial would further a “perception that BPD has something to hide.” The court stopped shy of ordering Baltimore Police to waive the costs of producing the closed force investigations. But it urged a “good faith” consideration of the public interest factors at play by Baltimore Police, given the “guidance” provided in the ruling. Zernhelt told The Baltimore Sun that Open Justice Baltimore hopes the police “honor the spirit and directions of the Supreme Court.” “Police misconduct must be brought into the light, otherwise, we have seen, the community suffers,” said Zernhelt, calling the decision a win for government transparency. “We will continue to support community members fighting for justice.” [ A Maryland trooper shared an offensive meme a week after police killed George Floyd. His punishment: retiring 3 years later. ] The Supreme Court case, argued in January, drew briefs from the state’s public defenders and some public interest groups expressing concern about the exorbitant fees being charged by police departments for investigative files. The Baltimore Sun joined one brief from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. That filing argued public access to records is “essential to democracy” and urged the court to safeguard the public and members of the news media against arbitrary and capricious denials of fee waiver requests. “Access to public records makes possible powerful reporting that can serve as a catalyst for important public debate and reform,” the brief said. Breaking News Alerts Records now considered public — under 2021′s “Anton’s Law” that made police misconduct files subject to disclosure — will never be made public if they come “with a price tag in excess of one million dollars,” wrote Deborah Katz Levi, the Maryland Office of Public Defenders’ director of special litigation wrote in another brief. The public defenders’ office described submitting 57 requests for records of 562 officers, and receiving a cost estimate of $1,716,530.33. It said at the time it had received nine partial files and hundreds of summaries. Levi added Friday that, across the state, police agencies have provided cost estimates ranging from several hundred thousand dollars to more than $1 million. “We are hopeful that this decision will encourage police departments to create a fee structure or waive fees altogether for people who are less affluent and the entities that work for them,” Levi said. Zernhelt, too, described ongoing hurdles to obtaining police records. Rather than outright denying fee waivers, the department has been granting partial ones, he said — “conveniently” leaving enough of a fee to make access “insurmountable.” Separately, Open Justice Baltimore has obtained a series of Baltimore Police internal investigations done by its Special Investigations Response Team, which also would be responsible for investigations of serious misconduct. Those investigative files, published online, are described by the groups as “representative of how BPD actually holds themselves accountable.”"
Ta'Kiya Young's family urges officer's arrest after video shows him killing the pregnant Black woman,9/1/23,2023-09-03T03:13:27Z,en,amsterdamnews.com,https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/09/01/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230903031327id_/https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/09/01/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230903031327/https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/09/01/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGFtc3RlcmRhbW5ld3MpL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wOS8wMS90YWtpeWEteW91bmdzLWZhbWlseS11cmdlcy1vZmZpY2Vycy1hcnJlc3QtYWZ0ZXItdmlkZW8tc2hvd3MtaGltLWtpbGxpbmctdGhlLXByZWduYW50LWJsYWNrLXdvbWFu,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio authorities on Friday released bodycam video showing a police officer fatally shooting Ta’Kiya Young in her car in what her family denounced as a “gross misuse of power and authority” against the pregnant Black mother. Sean Walton, an attorney representing Young’s family, said the video clearly shows that the Aug. 24 shooting of the 21-year-old woman was unjustified and he called for the officer to be fired and charged immediately. Walton also criticized police for not releasing the video footage for more than a week after the shooting. “Ta’Kiya’s family is heartbroken,” Walton said in an interview with The Associated Press. “The video did nothing but confirm their fears that Ta’Kiya was murdered unjustifiably … and it was just heartbreaking for them to see Ta’Kiya having her life taken away under such ridiculous circumstances.” Young’s death follows a troubling series of fatal shootings of Black adults and children by Ohio police and numerous occurrences of police brutality against Black people across the nation in recent years, events that have prompted widespread protests and demands for police reform. The officer who shot Young is on paid administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation examines the shooting, which is standard practice. A police union official said calls to charge the officer before an investigation is complete are premature. A second officer who was on the scene has returned to active duty. Their names, races and ranks have not been released. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford called the shooting a tragedy. “Ms. Young’s family is understandably very upset and grieving,” he said in a written statement released Friday morning. “While none of us can fully understand the depths of their pain, all of us can remember them in our prayers and give them the time and space to deal with this heartbreaking turn of events.” Young’s father, grandmother and other relatives watched the video before its public release and released a statement Friday through Walton. “It is undeniable that Ta’Kiya’s death was not only avoidable, but also a gross misuse of power and authority,” the statement said. While viewing the video, the family felt “a lot of anger, a lot of frustration,” Walton told the AP. “More than anything, there was … a sense of just devastation, to know that this power system, these police officers, could stop her and so quickly take her life for no justifiable reason.” The video shows an officer at the driver’s side window telling Young she has been accused of theft and repeatedly demanding that she get out of the car. A second officer is standing in front of the car. Young protests, and the first officer repeats his demand. Then both officers yell at her to get out. At that point, Young can be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?” seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the officer standing in front of it. The officer fires his gun through the windshield and Young’s sedan drifts into the grocery store’s brick wall. Officers then break the driver’s side window, which Belford said was to get Young out of the car and render medical aid, though footage of medical assistance was not provided. In his interview with the AP on Friday, Walton denied that Young had stolen anything from the grocery store. He said his firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the store. “The bottles were left in the store,” he said. “So when she’s in her car denying that, that’s accurate. She did not commit any theft, and so these officers were not even within their right to place her under arrest, let alone take her life.” Brian Steel, executive vice president of the union representing Blendon Township police, criticized Walton’s characterization of the shooting as murder before all the facts are in. He said an investigation will determine whether the shooting was justified. “The fact is, (the officer) had to make a split-second decision while in front of a moving vehicle, a 2,000-pound weapon,” he said. But Edward Obayashi, a national use-of-force expert and attorney who specializes in vehicle-related police shootings, said that while the officer who shot Young may have reasonably feared for his safety, it went against all his law enforcement training to be in front of her car in the first place. “The best practice in these matters nationwide is that you do not put yourself in a position of danger,” said Obayashi, especially given that it was a minor crime Young was being accused of. “The results are predictable. … Based on your training, why are you going to put yourself in front of a vehicle, in front of an individual that does not want to cooperate?” Obayashi said. “There was no urgent need for him to position himself the way he did.” The Blendon Township police department’s use of force policy states that officers should try to move away from an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapons. An officer should only shoot when he or she “reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.” Responding to criticism of the delay in releasing the video, Belford said it took time for his small staff to process it and properly redact certain footage, such as officers’ faces and badge numbers, in accordance with Ohio law. He said the officers’ names cannot be released at this point because they are being treated as assault victims. He said one of the officer’s arms was still partially in the driver’s side window and a second officer was still standing in front of the car when Young moved the car forward. Young’s death is one of numerous deaths of Black adults and children at the hands of police across the nation that have drawn protests and demands for more accountability. Among the most prominent cases was George Floyd’s death on May 25, 2020. Floyd died after then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder. In Ohio, Donovan Lewis was lying on his bed in August 2022 when he was shot by a K-9 officer serving a warrant. Ma’Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old girl in foster care who was accused of swinging at two people with a knife, was fatally shot in April 2021. In December 2020, Casey Goodson Jr., was shot five times in the back by a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy. Ohio Families Unite for Political Action and Change, a grassroots organization focused on eradicating police brutality, said the footage of Young’s shooting shows officers’ conduct was “violent, defenseless, and egregious” and that they acted as “judge, jury and executioner.” Young was expected to give birth to a daughter in November. Family and friends held a private vigil a day after Young was killed, releasing balloons and lighting candles spelling out “RIP Kiya.” An online effort to pay her funeral expenses has raised over $7,000. Ta’Kiya’s siblings, cousins, grandmother and father have rallied around her sons, 6-year-old Ja’Kobie and 3-year-old Ja’Kenlie, who don’t yet understand the magnitude of what happened to their mother, Walton said. “It’s a large family and Ta’Kiya has been snatched away from them,” Walton said. “I think the entire family is still in shock.” Young’s grandmother, Nadine Young, described her granddaughter as a family-oriented prankster who was a loving older sister and mother. “She was so excited to have this little girl,” the grandmother said at a news conference Wednesday. “She has her two little boys, but she was so fired up to have this girl. She is going to be so missed.” “I’m a mess because it’s just tragic,” she said, “but it should have never, ever, ever happened.” ___ Associated Press writers Aaron Morrison in New York; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania; and video journalist Patrick Orsagos in Columbus contributed to this report. ___ Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Jesse Glen Nelson, 43, is believed to have shot and killed his 74-year-old mother, Maria Rosario Morales, on Monday at a home on Iona Drive near Market Street, police said in a news release. During a standoff with police, Officers Darwin Anderson and Matthew Steinbach fired at Nelson, killing him. Police did not say which officer shot first or which one fired the fatal shot. Anderson has been with the San Diego Police Department since September 2021 and is currently assigned to the Southeastern Division. Steinbach has been employed by the department for 11 years and is assigned to Western Division and the SWAT team. The incident began shortly after police received a report of gunshots being fired at the home around 8:40 p.m. When officers arrived, they found Morales and a dog lying on the homeâs driveway with gunshot wounds. While officers attempted to medically treat Morales, a gunman, later identified as her son, opened fire on the officers from inside the home, police said. At least one officer returned fire. As police backup arrived and surrounded the area, the officers were able to reach Morales and pull her off the driveway, police said. The gunman fired more rounds in their direction. SWAT units responded to the scene due to the âextreme nature of the situation unfolding,â officials said in the news release. During the standoff, Nelson allegedly set fire to the homeâs garage with himself still in it but refused to leave the house, police said. When Nelson walked outside the home, armed with a rifle, an officer shot the man, police said. A second dog was found dead inside the home. The Sheriffâs Department is investigating the incident, under a countywide protocol involving officer-involved shootings. After the Sheriffâs Department completes its investigation, the District Attorneyâs Office will review the case, as it does in all shootings involving law enforcement. The Police Department will conduct an internal administrative investigation, officials said, and the Commission on Police Practices is expected to review the incident, as well.

73 weapons turned in at Evanston gun buyback event,9/1/23,2023-09-03T02:09:58Z,en,chicagotribune.com,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/ct-evr-gun-buyback-tl-0907-20230901-7chez6cfjnc3fgijpnzujmtvji-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230903020958id_/https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/ct-evr-gun-buyback-tl-0907-20230901-7chez6cfjnc3fgijpnzujmtvji-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20230903020958/https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/ct-evr-gun-buyback-tl-0907-20230901-7chez6cfjnc3fgijpnzujmtvji-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lKS9zdWJ1cmJzL2V2YW5zdG9uL2N0LWV2ci1ndW4tYnV5YmFjay10bC0wOTA3LTIwMjMwOTAxLTdjaGV6NmNmam5jM2ZnaWpwbnp1am10dmppLXN0b3J5Lmh0bWw~,"If the age-old idiom “an ounce prevention is worth a pound of cure” is true than the impact of a recent gun buyback program in Evanston is probably immeasurable, officials said. The Aug. 26 gun buyback program at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Evanston netted police 73 weapons including 44 firearms, 29 pellet and BB guns and live ammunition, said Evanston Police Commander Ryan Glew. “Whenever you can secure 44 unwanted firearms it yields a benefit to the community that it’s a little bit safer,” said Glew. “It’s hard to measure the positive impact of that.” He said anyone who turned in a firearm received $100 cash per firearm and if they turned in pellet, BB, or airsoft guns or ammunition they got $25 cash. Funds for the gun buyback came from donations held by the Evanston Community Foundation. Evanston police partnered with the Evanston Community Foundation and Mount Zion Baptist Church, in the 1100 block of Clark Street, to host the three hour gun buyback event which provided an opportunity for anyone to turn in unwanted or unused firearms so the weapons could be destroyed, said Glew. He also said that “amnesty” was a big part of the program because people could turn in guns without being asked any questions or risk being arrested. “It gives them a certain level of comfort and trust and communicates our intent as far as we’re just looking to get those guns off the street,” he explained. “We’re not looking to make arrests. This isn’t a trick. This isn’t a trap. It’s not a curve ball. Just bring it in. Be in compliance with the law. Get that gun you don’t want anymore to where it needs to be so it’s secure.” And although the 29 pellet, BB, and airsoft guns recovered are not necessarily lethal, getting them off the street is vitally important to police and the public, said Glew. “Even a pellet gun or a BB gun can be used in criminal activity where the victim’s going to believe it’s an actual firearm,” he explained. “There are crimes such as robbery that are committed with BB guns and pellet guns that look very much like the real thing. It creates a very hazardous situation for the community even if the gun isn’t real.” He also said a big concern for law enforcement is that there could be an officer involved shootings where suspects are shot by the police because they brandish a pellet gun or BB gun that looks like the real thing. The gun buyback being held in a local church was critical in ensuring people took advantage of it, Glew said. “It strengthens our ties with the community in that common goal of making neighborhoods safer by getting unwanted guns out of circulation,” he explained. “Having it at a house of worship makes people more comfortable. It’s not at the police station. It’s not at city hall. It’s at a house or worship. It’s being held by a community leader, a member of the clergy. I can’t think of a downside to it.” And as part of the program, Mount Moriah Lodge #28 in the 1400 block of Maple Avenue gave free gunlocks to anyone who asked for them, Glew said. “Maybe they have guns that they want to keep and they’re legally possessed, they’re able to come in and get a gun lock and secure the guns they have at home,” he added.

He also left before vaccines to combat the virus had become widespread. Trump, who has long boasted about the booming stock market during his tenure as evidence of a strong economy, has attacked Biden on the issue and touted his push to shore up manufacturing jobs in the U.S. in a video released this week. Friday’s jobs report showed the U.S. added 187,000 jobs in August, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.8 percent. Economists had expected the U.S. to gain 170,000 jobs and maintain the July jobless rate of 3.5 percent. “We created more jobs in two years than any president ever created in a four-year, single four-year term,” Biden added, noting the U.S. had a 6.3 percent unemployment rate when he took office at the end of Trump’s term.

Man who smashed Capitol window on Jan. 6 gets 10 years Former Proud Boy member Dominic Pezzola, who smashed a Capitol window with a police shield during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. The judge at his sentencing hearing called Pezzola, 46, “the tip of the spear” in the Capitol ambush that sent lawmakers to safety as hundreds of angry Trump supporters flooded the building. Pezzola, who who joined the far-right extremist group shortly before the riot, was convicted on several charges but was acquitted on a seditious conspiracy charge. “The reality is you were the one who did it,” U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said during Pezzola’s sentencing hearing, according to CNN. “You were the one who smashed that window in and let people begin to stream into the Capitol building and threaten the lives of our lawmakers.” Despite sobbing and apologizing during the hearing, Pezzola raised his fist as he left the court house and yelled, “Trump won.” Troops staying on border at least through end of month Hundreds of active-duty U.S. troops will remain at the U.S.-Mexico border until at least the start of October to aid the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to combat illegal crossings. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “approved an extension of up to 400 personnel providing support to Customs and Border Protection on the Southwest border through September 30, 2023,” Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Devin Robinson told The Hill in a statement. The Biden administration in May initially approved a 90-day deployment of 1,500 troops to the southern border. After dipping to less than 3,000 a day earlier this summer, illegal southwest border crossings have climbed to up to around 5,000-6,000, according to federal data.

The disclosures have prompted calls for increased scrutiny of Supreme Court oversight and ethics. “This late-come effort at ‘Clean-up on Aisle Three’ won’t deter us from fully investigating the massive, secret, right-wing billionaire influence in which this Court is enmired,” Whitehouse said. 👀 New York City using drones to monitor outdoor backyard parties New York City will be using drones to monitor large outdoor gatherings over the Labor Day weekend, police have announced. “If a caller states there’s a large crowd, a large party in a backyard, we’re going to be utilizing our assets to go up and go check on the party,” Assistant New York Police Commissioner Kaz Daughtry said at a press conference. New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) hyped up the use of drones last month. “Today, New York City is flying into the future, using drones to make city services faster and safer, and likely saving taxpayer dollars as well,” he said. 🚆 Biden pauses Trump-era policy on natural gas by rail The Biden administration has put a hold on a Trump-era policy that allowed natural gas to be shipped by rail because of safety concerns. The Department of Transportation halted the 2020 policy until it can publish a companion rule or until June 30, 2025, if a rule is not completed by then. The Transportation Department said its goal is to avoid “potential risks to public health and safety or environmental consequences” and allow for more testing and the inclusion of possible mitigation measures. 🚨 Video released in fatal police shooting of pregnant Black woman Authorities in Ohio have released footage of the fatal police shooting of a pregnant woman in a grocery store parking lot. Ta’Kiya Young, a 21-year-old Black woman, was accused of shoplifting from the store. Police officers were already on the scene when they approached her car.

The footage, posted in a video with retired Sheriff Russ Martin’s analysis, came from the body camera of the two officers involved in the shooting, which took place Aug. 24 at a grocery store in Blendon Township. In the video, Martin said officers were already at the grocery store on an unrelated call when a store employee approached them about Young, who had allegedly stolen several items. One of the officers immediately proceeded to where Young was sitting in her parked car and demanded she exit the vehicle. Young rolled down her window and asked, “For what?” The second officer approached and stood in front of her car as the first continued to instruct her to exit her car. The video then showed Young slowly accelerate forward toward the officer who was standing in front of her car. He yelled at her to stop before firing a single shot that struck her. “The officer who was directly in the path of the oncoming car fired one shot through the front windshield,” Martin said in the video. “The body camera footage I’ve reviewed also confirms the officer was directly in the path of the car.” After she was shot, Young’s car continued rolling forward for about 50 feet before it appeared to hit the outside grocery store wall. Officers smashed the driver’s side window and pulled Young out of the car. Though the Franklin County coroner’s office did not disclose where Young was hit, Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford said officers applied a chest seal to Young’s wound with the help of an emergency room doctor who happened to be on site. But the medical attention did not save Young’s life — she died later that evening. Her unborn daughter, due in November, also did not survive. The footage released Friday came after Young’s family had the chance to view it with their representation. According to Sean Walton, an attorney representing the family, they had grown frustrated with the delay in the video release. They are now calling for the officers who were involved to be named. The unidentified officers were put on paid administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation examines the shooting. The first officer, who did not fire his weapon, has returned from leave and is on back patrol duty. Belford told the Columbus Dispatch Friday that the first officer had his arm and hand inside the driver’s window when Young accelerated, making him a victim of misdemeanor assault. The second officer, who fired his weapon, was allegedly struck by the vehicle and was a victim of attempted vehicular assault. Walton told The Associated Press on Thursday that the community would be “outraged” by the video. “She was an unarmed pregnant mother of two,” Walton said. “It goes beyond the unjustifiable.” An online effort to pay for Young’s funeral expenses has raised nearly $7,000.

Ta'Kiya Young's family urges officer's arrest after video shows him killing the pregnant Black woman,9/1/23,2023-09-02T02:15:23Z,en,startribune.com,https://www.startribune.com/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/600301336/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230902021523id_/https://www.startribune.com/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/600301336/,https://web.archive.org/web/20230902021523/https://www.startribune.com/takiya-youngs-family-urges-officers-arrest-after-video-shows-him-killing-the-pregnant-black-woman/600301336/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN0YXJ0cmlidW5lKS90YWtpeWEteW91bmdzLWZhbWlseS11cmdlcy1vZmZpY2Vycy1hcnJlc3QtYWZ0ZXItdmlkZW8tc2hvd3MtaGltLWtpbGxpbmctdGhlLXByZWduYW50LWJsYWNrLXdvbWFuLzYwMDMwMTMzNg~~,"COLUMBUS, Ohio â Ohio authorities on Friday released bodycam video showing a police officer fatally shooting Ta'Kiya Young in her car in what her family denounced as a ''gross misuse of power and authority'' against the pregnant Black mother. Sean Walton, an attorney representing Young's family, said the video clearly shows that the Aug. 24 shooting of the 21-year-old woman was unjustified and he called for the officer to be fired and charged immediately. Walton also criticized police for not releasing the video footage for more than a week after the shooting. ''Ta'Kiya's family is heartbroken,"" Walton said in an interview with The Associated Press. ''The video did nothing but confirm their fears that Ta'Kiya was murdered unjustifiably ... and it was just heartbreaking for them to see Ta'Kiya having her life taken away under such ridiculous circumstances.'' Young's death follows a troubling series of fatal shootings of Black adults and children by Ohio police and numerous occurrences of police brutality against Black people across the nation in recent years, events that have prompted widespread protests and demands for police reform. The officer who shot Young is on paid administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation examines the shooting, which is standard practice. A police union official said calls to charge the officer before an investigation is complete are premature. A second officer who was on the scene has returned to active duty. Their names, races and ranks have not been released. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford called the shooting a tragedy. ''Ms. Young's family is understandably very upset and grieving,'' he said in a written statement released Friday morning. ""While none of us can fully understand the depths of their pain, all of us can remember them in our prayers and give them the time and space to deal with this heartbreaking turn of events.'' Young's father, grandmother and other relatives watched the video before its public release and released a statement Friday through Walton. ''It is undeniable that Ta'Kiya's death was not only avoidable, but also a gross misuse of power and authority,'' the statement said. While viewing the video, the family felt ''a lot of anger, a lot of frustration,'' Walton told the AP. ''More than anything, there was ... a sense of just devastation, to know that this power system, these police officers, could stop her and so quickly take her life for no justifiable reason.'' The video shows an officer at the driver's side window telling Young she has been accused of theft and repeatedly demanding that she get out of the car. A second officer is standing in front of the car. Young protests, and the first officer repeats his demand. Then both officers yell at her to get out. At that point, Young can be heard asking them, ''Are you going to shoot me?'' seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the officer standing in front of it. The officer fires his gun through the windshield and Young's sedan drifts into the grocery store's brick wall. Officers then break the driver's side window, which Belford said was to get Young out of the car and render medical aid, though footage of medical assistance was not provided. In his interview with the AP on Friday, Walton denied that Young had stolen anything from the grocery store. He said his firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the store. ''The bottles were left in the store,"" he said. ""So when she's in her car denying that, that's accurate. She did not commit any theft, and so these officers were not even within their right to place her under arrest, let alone take her life.'' Brian Steel, executive vice president of the union representing Blendon Township police, criticized Walton's characterization of the shooting as murder before all the facts are in. He said an investigation will determine whether the shooting was justified. ''The fact is, (the officer) had to make a split-second decision while in front of a moving vehicle, a 2,000-pound weapon,'' he said. But Edward Obayashi, a national use-of-force expert and attorney who specializes in vehicle-related police shootings, said that while the officer who shot Young may have reasonably feared for his safety, it went against all his law enforcement training to be in front of her car in the first place. ''The best practice in these matters nationwide is that you do not put yourself in a position of danger,'' said Obayashi, especially given that it was a minor crime Young was being accused of. ''The results are predictable. â¦ Based on your training, why are you going to put yourself in front of a vehicle, in front of an individual that does not want to cooperate?'' Obayashi said. ''There was no urgent need for him to position himself the way he did.'' The Blendon Township police department's use of force policy states that officers should try to move away from an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapons. An officer should only shoot when he or she ''reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.'' Responding to criticism of the delay in releasing the video, Belford said it took time for his small staff to process it and properly redact certain footage, such as officers' faces and badge numbers, in accordance with Ohio law. He said the officers' names cannot be released at this point because they are being treated as assault victims. He said one of the officer's arms was still partially in the driver's side window and a second officer was still standing in front of the car when Young moved the car forward. Young's death is one of numerous deaths of Black adults and children at the hands of police across the nation that have drawn protests and demands for more accountability. Among the most prominent cases was George Floyd's death on May 25, 2020. Floyd died after then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder. In Ohio, Donovan Lewis was lying on his bed in August 2022 when he was shot by a K-9 officer serving a warrant. Ma'Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old girl in foster care who was accused of swinging at two people with a knife, was fatally shot in April 2021. In December 2020, Casey Goodson Jr., was shot five times in the back by a Franklin County sheriff's deputy. Ohio Families Unite for Political Action and Change, a grassroots organization focused on eradicating police brutality, said the footage of Young's shooting shows officers' conduct was ''violent, defenseless, and egregious"" and that they acted as ''judge, jury and executioner.'' Young was expected to give birth to a daughter in November. Family and friends held a private vigil a day after Young was killed, releasing balloons and lighting candles spelling out ''RIP Kiya.'' An online effort to pay her funeral expenses has raised over $7,000. Ta'Kiya's siblings, cousins, grandmother and father have rallied around her sons, 6-year-old Ja'Kobie and 3-year-old Ja'Kenlie, who don't yet understand the magnitude of what happened to their mother, Walton said. ''It's a large family and Ta'Kiya has been snatched away from them,'' Walton said. ''I think the entire family is still in shock.'' Young's grandmother, Nadine Young, described her granddaughter as a family-oriented prankster who was a loving older sister and mother. ''She was so excited to have this little girl,'' the grandmother said at a news conference Wednesday. ''She has her two little boys, but she was so fired up to have this girl. She is going to be so missed.'' ''I'm a mess because it's just tragic,'' she said, ''but it should have never, ever, ever happened.'' ___ Associated Press writers Aaron Morrison in New York; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania; and video journalist Patrick Orsagos in Columbus contributed to this report. ___ Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Denver police on Friday released body camera footage from two police officers who responded to the scene of the forced crash that appears to show a man holding a woman hostage and threatening to kill her before an officer shot the suspect.  However, Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas at a news conference said the man and the woman were known to each other and that the pair planned the hostage situation to dupe police and try to escape arrest.  The incident happened about 11:20 p.m. Aug. 25 in the 3500 block of York Street, police said.  Body camera footage from two officers released Friday shows shots being fired at police from inside a pickup truck as police were pursuing suspects in the truck.  In footage from the body camera worn by the officer who shot the suspect, the officer is seen pursuing the truck at a high speed as shots are fired from the truck and the officer, in a patrol SUV, bumps the truck, causing it to roll and come to stop on its side.  Several officers surround the truck and yell out commands for the four people, two men and two women, inside the truck to show their hands and come out of the truck, for about 15 minutes. Then, a man, identified Friday by police as Keith Michael Mosley, 35, emerges from the truck while pretending to hold a gun to the woman’s head.  “I’m going to kill this bitch,” Mosley is heard saying in footage from the body camera worn by another officer at the scene. “I’m gonna kill her.”  In the dark of night and because they were standing some yards away, , officers believed Mosley to be armed, police said.  The pair are seen in the body camera footage heading south away from the truck, with officers screaming for them to stop and show their hands to no avail. The suspect and woman go behind a chain link fence and are on private property between two homes when the officer with a rifle fires one shot, hitting the suspect. The man and woman fall to the ground.  The woman, crying, tells police she has the gun. “I’m going to kill myself,” she cries out.  Officers yell for the pair to show their hands and put their hands on their heads. They yell for the woman to crawl toward them, away from the man, so they can help her and get medical help for him. After a couple minutes, the man surrenders.  Police did recover three guns at the scene, but not on or near Mosley, who was shot in the face, or the woman who said that she was armed. One gun was found in the street, near where the truck had rolled. Another gun was found under the truck, and a third gun was found inside the truck after police served a search warrant.  Mosley was taken to a hospital in stable condition. The woman was treated for a leg injury and two other people in the truck, who remained inside the vehicle as the incident unfolded, were also taken to a hospital.  The 28-year-old man who was driving the truck was arrested on a parole violation. Police on Friday said that Mosley pointed a gun at the driver, threatening him and commanding him to keep driving, as Mosley fired shots at pursuing officers.  Two women at the scene, one who remained in the truck and the woman who was held and threatened in the hostage ploy, were arrested on unrelated warrants, police said.  Two other suspects were arrested at a residence in the 4700 block of Josephine Street, near where the pursuit of the pickup truck originated. A 33-year-old man is being investigated for criminal attempted first-degree murder in connection to a road rage incident, with shots fired at a victim’s vehicle on Interstate 25, near Colfax Avenue, earlier on Aug. 25 prior to the police shooting. A woman at the residence was arrested on unrelated warrants.  Police on Friday, in a news release, said that their update on the police shooting is consistent with the department’s “practice of providing a follow-up briefing intended to provide additional details beyond the preliminary information released during the initial briefing at the scene.”  Thomas gave a briefing early Aug. 26, shortly after the incident, at the scene. His initial briefing is consistent with the video and information released by police on Friday.  At the Friday news conference, Thomas said Denver officers demonstrated restraint during the incident, as suspects showed blunt disregard for public safety, leading officers on the chase and firing from inside the truck.  The footage from the camera worn by the officer who fired the rifle at the suspect goes dark for a moment but returns to visual footage. The footage from the other officer was released because it shows a different angle, including “the suspect’s actions after exiting the vehicle and when the involved officer discharged his firearm,” police said.

Walton also criticized police for not releasing the video footage for more than a week after the shooting. “Ta’Kiya’s family is heartbroken,"" Walton said in an interview with The Associated Press. “The video did nothing but confirm their fears that Ta’Kiya was murdered unjustifiably ... and it was just heartbreaking for them to see Ta’Kiya having her life taken away under such ridiculous circumstances.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Young’s death follows a troubling series of fatal shootings of Black adults and children by Ohio police and numerous occurrences of police brutality against Black people across the nation in recent years, events that have prompted widespread protests and demands for police reform. The officer who shot Young is on paid administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation examines the shooting, which is standard practice. A police union official said calls to charge the officer before an investigation is complete are premature. A second officer who was on the scene has returned to active duty. Their names, races and ranks have not been released. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford called the shooting a tragedy. “Ms. Young’s family is understandably very upset and grieving,” he said in a written statement released Friday morning. ""While none of us can fully understand the depths of their pain, all of us can remember them in our prayers and give them the time and space to deal with this heartbreaking turn of events.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Young’s father, grandmother and other relatives watched the video before its public release and released a statement Friday through Walton. “It is undeniable that Ta’Kiya’s death was not only avoidable, but also a gross misuse of power and authority,” the statement said. While viewing the video, the family felt “a lot of anger, a lot of frustration,” Walton told the AP. “More than anything, there was ... a sense of just devastation, to know that this power system, these police officers, could stop her and so quickly take her life for no justifiable reason.” The video shows an officer at the driver’s side window telling Young she has been accused of theft and repeatedly demanding that she get out of the car. A second officer is standing in front of the car. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Young protests, and the first officer repeats his demand. Then both officers yell at her to get out. At that point, Young can be heard asking them, “Are you going to shoot me?” seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the officer standing in front of it. The officer fires his gun through the windshield and Young’s sedan drifts into the grocery store’s brick wall. Officers then break the driver's side window, which Belford said was to get Young out of the car and render medical aid, though footage of medical assistance was not provided. In his interview with the AP on Friday, Walton denied that Young had stolen anything from the grocery store. He said his firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the store. “The bottles were left in the store,"" he said. ""So when she’s in her car denying that, that’s accurate. She did not commit any theft, and so these officers were not even within their right to place her under arrest, let alone take her life.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Brian Steel, executive vice president of the union representing Blendon Township police, criticized Walton’s characterization of the shooting as murder before all the facts are in. He said an investigation will determine whether the shooting was justified. “The fact is, (the officer) had to make a split-second decision while in front of a moving vehicle, a 2,000-pound weapon,” he said. But Edward Obayashi, a national use-of-force expert and attorney who specializes in vehicle-related police shootings, said that while the officer who shot Young may have reasonably feared for his safety, it went against all his law enforcement training to be in front of her car in the first place. “The best practice in these matters nationwide is that you do not put yourself in a position of danger,” said Obayashi, especially given that it was a minor crime Young was being accused of. “The results are predictable. … Based on your training, why are you going to put yourself in front of a vehicle, in front of an individual that does not want to cooperate?” Obayashi said. “There was no urgent need for him to position himself the way he did.” The Blendon Township police department’s use of force policy states that officers should try to move away from an approaching vehicle instead of firing their weapons. An officer should only shoot when he or she “reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Responding to criticism of the delay in releasing the video, Belford said it took time for his small staff to process it and properly redact certain footage, such as officers’ faces and badge numbers, in accordance with Ohio law. He said the officers’ names cannot be released at this point because they are being treated as assault victims. He said one of the officer’s arms was still partially in the driver’s side window and a second officer was still standing in front of the car when Young moved the car forward. Young's death is one of numerous deaths of Black adults and children at the hands of police across the nation that have drawn protests and demands for more accountability. Among the most prominent cases was George Floyd's death on May 25, 2020. Floyd died after then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.

Ohio authorities released body-camera video Friday of a police officer fatally shooting Ta’Kiya Young in what her family denounced as a “gross misuse of power and authority” against the pregnant Black woman. Sean Walton, a lawyer representing Young’s family, said the video clearly shows that the Aug. 24 shooting of the 21-year-old woman was unjustified, and called for the officer to be fired and charged immediately. He also criticized police for not releasing the video for more than a week after the shooting. “Ta’Kiya’s family is heartbroken,” Walton said in an interview with the Associated Press. “The video did nothing but confirm their fears that Ta’Kiya was murdered unjustifiably ... and it was just heartbreaking for them to see Ta’Kiya having her life taken away under such ridiculous circumstances.” Young’s death follows a troubling series of fatal shootings of Black adults and children by police in Ohio and numerous cases of police brutality against Black people across the nation in recent years — events that have prompted widespread protests and demands for police reform. The officer who shot Young is on paid administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation examines the shooting, which is standard practice. A police union official said it was premature to call for charging the officer before an investigation is complete. A second officer who was on the scene has returned to duty. Their names, races and ranks have not been released. Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford called the shooting a tragedy. “Ms. Young’s family is understandably very upset and grieving,” he said in a written statement released Friday morning. “While none of us can fully understand the depths of their pain, all of us can remember them in our prayers and give them the time and space to deal with this heartbreaking turn of events.” LAPD will use artificial intelligence to analyze body camera video as part of a broader study of whether officers’ language escalates public encounters. Young’s father, grandmother and other relatives watched the video before it was made public, and released a statement Friday through Walton, saying: “It is undeniable that Ta’Kiya’s death was not only avoidable, but also a gross misuse of power and authority.” While watching the video, the family felt “a lot of anger, a lot of frustration,” Walton told the AP. “More than anything, there was ... a sense of just devastation, to know that this power system, these police officers, could stop her and so quickly take her life for no justifiable reason.” The video shows an officer at the driver’s side window telling Young she had been accused of theft and repeatedly demanding that she get out of the car. A second officer is seen standing in front of the car. Young protests, and the first officer repeats his demand. Then both officers yell at her to get out. Young asks them, “Are you going to shoot me?” seconds before she turns the steering wheel to the right and the car moves toward the officer standing in front of it. He shoots her through the windshield and her sedan drifts into the brick wall of a grocery store. Officers then break the driver’s side window, which the police chief said was to get Young out of the car to render medical aid. Video of her receiving medical assistance was not provided. Video of a conversation between Brink’s drivers and sheriff’s deputies provides a new look at the initial response to the July 2022 crime, which victimized 14 jewelers. In his interview with the AP, the family’s lawyer denied that Young had stolen anything from the grocery store. Walton said his firm found a witness who saw Young put down bottles of alcohol as she left the store. “The bottles were left in the store,” he said. “So when she’s in her car denying that, that’s accurate. She did not commit any theft, and so these officers were not even within their right to place her under arrest, let alone take her life.” Brian Steel, executive vice president of the union that represents Blendon Township police, criticized Walton’s characterization of Young’s fatal shooting as a murder before all the facts were in. He said an investigation would determine whether the shooting was justified. The officer “had to make a split-second decision while in front of a moving vehicle, a 2,000-pound weapon,” Steel said. Responding to criticism of the delay in releasing the video, Belford said it took time for his small staff to process it and properly redact parts, such as officers’ faces and badge numbers, in accordance with Ohio law. He said the officers’ names could not be released at this point because they were being treated as assault victims. He said one of the officer’s arms was still partially in the driver’s side window and the other officer was in front of the car when it began to move it forward. Weeks after sheriff’s deputies were filmed assaulting a woman in front of a Lancaster WinCo, the Sheriff’s Department released footage of a deputy in Palmdale punching a woman carrying her baby after a traffic stop. Young’s death is one of numerous killings of Black adults and children by police across the nation that have drawn protests and demands for more accountability from law enforcement. Among the most prominent cases was George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis in May 2020. Then-Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck for 9½ minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd had been accused of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder. In Ohio, Donovan Lewis, 20, was lying on his bed in August 2022 when he was shot by an officer serving a warrant. Ma’Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old girl in foster care who was accused of swinging at two people with a knife, was fatally shot in April 2021. And in December 2020, Casey Goodson Jr., 23, was shot five times in the back by a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy. Ohio Families Unite for Political Action and Change, a grassroots organization focused on eradicating police brutality, said the video of Young’s shooting shows officers’ conduct was “violent, defenseless, and egregious” and that they had acted as “judge, jury and executioner.” Young was expected to give birth to a daughter in November. Family and friends held a private vigil a day after Young was killed, releasing balloons and lighting candles that spelled out “RIP Kiya.” An online effort to pay her funeral expenses had raised over $7,600 as of Friday afternoon. Young’s siblings, cousins, grandmother and father have rallied around her sons, 6-year-old Ja’Kobie and 3-year-old Ja’Kenlie, who don’t yet understand the magnitude of what happened to their mother, Walton said. “It’s a large family, and Ta’Kiya has been snatched away from them,” Walton said. “I think the entire family is still in shock.” Young’s grandmother, Nadine Young, described her granddaughter as a prankster as well as a loving big sister and mother. “She was so excited to have this little girl,” the grandmother said at a news conference Wednesday. “She has her two little boys, but she was so fired up to have this girl. She is going to be so missed.” “I’m a mess, because it’s just tragic,” she said. “But it should have never, ever, ever happened.” AP staff members Aaron Morrison in New York; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania; and Patrick Orsagos in Columbus contributed to this report.
