"27 years after his death, Tupac could win his first Grammy",2023-11-13,2023-11-14T19:34:21Z,en,seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/27-years-after-his-death-tupac-could-win-his-first-grammy/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114193421id_/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/27-years-after-his-death-tupac-could-win-his-first-grammy/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114193421/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/27-years-after-his-death-tupac-could-win-his-first-grammy/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcykvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkLzI3LXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLWhpcy1kZWF0aC10dXBhYy1jb3VsZC13aW4taGlzLWZpcnN0LWdyYW1teT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cnNzX2FsbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9cnNz,"Tupac Shakur could finally win his first Grammy, with a little help from his mom.
The rapper, who died in 1996, received a relatively little-noticed nomination Friday in the category of best music film for “Dear Mama,” a five-part FX docuseries directed by Allen Hughes now streaming on Hulu.
The series, which takes its name from Shakur’s single from the album “Me Against the World,” features Shakur’s life, music and relationship with his mother, Afeni Shakur, a Black Panther Party activist.
The Shakur film will compete against movies centered on Kendrick Lamar (“Live From Paris, the Big Steppers Tour”) and Lewis Capaldi (“How I’m Feeling Now”) as well as two other posthumous nominees, David Bowie (“Moonage Daydream”) and Little Richard (“I Am Everything”).
Bowie did win a competitive Grammy in his lifetime, but Little Richard infamously did not. “I have never received nothing,” Little Richard told the audience at the 1988 Grammy Awards. “Y’all never gave me no Grammys, and I’ve been singing for years! I am the architect of rock ‘n’ roll!” Little Richard won a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1993, but this would be his first Grammy in a competitive category.
This is Shakur’s seventh Grammy nomination and his second posthumous nod, according to Grammy data.
At the 1995 Grammys, Shakur was nominated for best rap album for “Me Against the World” and best rap solo performance for “Dear Mama.”
The next year â when Shakur wore a black pinstripe Versace suit and presented alongside KISS â Shakur was considered but passed over for best rap album (“All Eyez on Me”) and best rap performance by a duo or group (“California Love” and “How Do U Want It”).
Shakur received his first posthumous nomination in 1999 for best rap solo performance for “Changes,” which was released on the “Greatest Hits” collection.
Shakur was fatally shot on the Las Vegas strip in 1996 while riding in a BMW driven by Marion “Suge” Knight, the then-owner of Shakur’s “Death Row Records” label. He was 25.
In September, Las Vegas police made their first arrest in the long-unsolved slaying. Duane “Keffe D” Davis â who had previously admitted to riding in the car from which the shots were fired but said another passenger was the shooter â has been indicted for murder, not for pulling the trigger but on suspicion of providing the gun and encouraging the shooting.
Davis has pleaded not guilty. An attorney for Davis, Ross Goodman, has said authorities have no gun, no car and no witnesses, just Davis’ comments about the shooting over the years.
The 66th Grammy Awards are set to be held Feb. 4 at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.

Colorado supermarket shooting suspect pleads not guilty by reason of insanity,2023-11-13,2023-11-15T04:28:15Z,en,seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/colorado-supermarket-shooting-suspects-case-finally-resumes-after-hes-ruled-competent/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231115042815id_/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/colorado-supermarket-shooting-suspects-case-finally-resumes-after-hes-ruled-competent/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231115042815/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/colorado-supermarket-shooting-suspects-case-finally-resumes-after-hes-ruled-competent/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcykvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL25hdGlvbi9jb2xvcmFkby1zdXBlcm1hcmtldC1zaG9vdGluZy1zdXNwZWN0cy1jYXNlLWZpbmFsbHktcmVzdW1lcy1hZnRlci1oZXMtcnVsZWQtY29tcGV0ZW50P3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1yc3NfYWxsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1yc3M~,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP) â A man accused of a mass shooting at a Colorado supermarket in 2021 pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity Tuesday as a judge ruled the case can move to a trial following testimony giving new details of how he killed most of the 10 victims in just over a minute using a gun with a high-capacity magazine.
Attorneys for Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa entered the plea before District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke in Boulder. The plea means Alissaâs attorneys are claiming mental illness prevented him from understanding right from wrong on March 22, 2021, the day of the attack.
The hearing marked the first time prosecutors have spoken publicly about what happened at the crowded store in the college town of Boulder in the more than two years since the shooting, with the case stalled for much of the time after the suspect was deemed mentally incompetent.
New revelations Tuesday included that the suspect researched how to carry out a mass shooting by keeping notes on his iPhone for months beforehand about guns and how to move and shoot people. An investigator said he targeted moving people and kept shooting them until they were dead and had six high capacity magazines, which are illegal to possess in Colorado.
âThis defendant came armed and ready to kill as many innocent defenseless and unarmed people as quickly as he could,â Prosecutor Michael Dougherty said. âHe killed eight of them within 69 seconds. He was able to do that because of the large capacity magazines.â
The 24-year-old defendant was recently deemed competent to stand trial after being forcibly medicated so that he could understand the proceedings. Competency is a separate legal issue than sanity and focuses on Alissaâs mental condition now, rather than when the shooting occurred.
Clad in an orange and white striped jail uniform, Alissa looked down in court and at times at the judge as she advised him of his rights before his plea was entered. If successful, the plea could allow Alissa, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, to avoid prison and instead be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital.
The perpetrator of a 2012 mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater also pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. But jurors in that case rejected the plea and sentenced defendant James Holmes to life in prison for the murders of 12 people.
Alissa is charged with 10 counts of murder, 15 counts of attempted murder and other offenses in the shooting in Boulder, a college town about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Denver. Neither his attorneys nor anyone else has disputed he was the gunman in the attack.
Bakke ruled Tuesday that the case can go to trial after determining there was sufficent evidence to proceed against Alissa. She ordered that experts conduct a sanity evaluation by Jan. 8 and tentatively scheduled a trial for August.
Boulder Police Detective Sarah Cantu gave key testimony Tuesday, describing how the gunman began firing as soon as he got out of his car in the store parking lot. She said Alissa first shot into the passenger side of a van parked beside him and then through its windshield, killing Neven Stanisic. Stanisic had just finished repairing a coffee machine at the Starbucks in the store.
Front end manager Rikki Olds was shot near the store entrance as Alissa entered, with only the length of Alissaâs rifle separating them, according to Cantu. There was no time for her to run or hide, the detective testified.
Cantu said the gunman targeted individuals who were moving and kept firing at them until they were dead, killing most of his victims within 69 seconds of beginning the attack. At one point he raised his rifle at a man who continued to shop, apparently unaware of the gunfire. But instead of firing, Cantu said, Alissa continued searching for victims and shot Suzanne Fountain, 59, when he saw her apparently leaving a hiding spot in another aisle.
âHe found moving targets, pursued them and shot them until they stopped moving,â Cantu said.
Some relatives of the victims wiped back tears as they watched the hearing in an area of the court reserved for families.
Alissa is accused of killing nine shoppers and workers inside and outside the store as well as Officer Eric Talley, a father of seven and one of the first three police officers who entered the store. All but Olds were shot multiple times and everyone who was shot was killed, Cantu testified.
Authorities have not determined a motive for the attack, Cantu said. But a forensic psychologist testified in September that the 24-year-old Alissa bought firearms to carry out a mass shooting and indicated âthere was some intention to commit suicide by cop.” Authorities have said Alissa used a legally purchased AR-556 pistol, which resembles a rifle.
Besides taking notes about how to shoot moving people, Alissa also researched how to make a rifle fully automatic, Cantu said.
Alissa was arrested in the store after being shot by a police officer, part of a second wave of law enforcement that entered after Talley was killed.
Outside court, Oldsâ uncle, Robert Olds, said it stung to learn Tuesday that she was killed at such close range. He attended Tuesday’s hearing with his mother, Jeanette Olds, who had raised Rikki.
Robert Olds said part of him wishes Alissa had been killed.
âBut the other half of me wishes that and hopes that at the end of this we find out the motive of why he did this,â he said.

In Venezuela, she said, she was lucky she could even attend school. Many other teenagers start working at an early age to help out their families, who often face extreme poverty.
But she did not have the same luck in the city that she once dreamed of visiting. The family went from sleeping on the floor of a police station, to a crowded shelter, to a house on the Far South Side, and then back to the floor of the police station after her stepfather Michael Castejon, 39, couldn’t afford the rent. He could not find a job that paid enough without a work permit, he said.
On Nov. 3, they set out to go back to Texas. And from there, they would go to Venezuela, the country they fled to seek asylum in the United States. They’re among the countless number of migrants who have chosen to leave Chicago in recent weeks in their search for a better life. They’re looking for warmer weather, more resources or to reunite with friends and family in other places.
One family of five left for Detroit because another migrant told them there was work there. One man went back to Texas, where he will join his cousins after trying his luck in Chicago. In the past month, at least 40 people, including Sevilla’s family, have left Chicago from the 1st District station on the Near South Side with the help of Catholic Charities of Chicago.
“The American Dream doesn’t exist anymore,” said Castejon as he laid on a blanket on the bare floor of the station the afternoon before they left. “There’s nothing here for us,” he added.
Migrants said they’re realizing the city is at a breaking point. Not only is there no more space in shelters, they also acknowledge that some residents in Chicago oppose the opening of more shelters for them. Castejon said that despite the dangerous trek to get here — often begging for money and sleeping in the streets to cross several borders — the journey had not been worth it.
His attempts to settle in the city failed. He said he never felt comfortable in a shelter, and that the hot meals, stipends and good jobs he’d heard about from other migrants never materialized. The father didn’t consider that once in the country, the family wouldn’t be granted asylum immediately and or even get a work permit while they wait.
It could have been misinformation, he said. Or that the benefits that those who arrived in the city before him, are no longer available because of the amount of people now here. But even after hearing that the temporary protected status (TPS) program was expanded and the process to get job permits could be accelerated, he decided he was exhausted and chose not to wait.
“We didn’t know things would be this hard,” he said. “I thought the process was faster.”
More than 2,000 people have gotten monetary aid from the state through Catholic Charities to relocate to other states with family and friends, according to Katie Bredemann, a spokesperson with Catholic Charities of Chicago. The program has been part of their effort to help ease the humanitarian crisis in Chicago and offer the migrants an opportunity to reunite with families or reach the city they intended to go to before being sent to Chicago.
“The state of Illinois determines who is eligible for relocation to other states, then Catholic Charities assists in helping to help make the travel arrangements,” Bredemann said in an email.
But while some migrants are choosing to leave, many more still arrive every week. In what could be considered a revolving door for taxpayers, for example, Catholic Charities of Chicago is using Illinois taxpayer money to transport the migrants who want to return to Texas or to other states while simultaneously the Catholic Charities of San Antonio and the city of Denver are using federal taxpayer money to send new migrants to Chicago.
As of Friday, there were 20, 700 migrants who have arrived in Chicago since August 2022 when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending migrants to sanctuary cities such as Chicago, in part to protest federal immigration policies.
Castejon said Chicago wasn’t what they expected when they arrived in June. But the father was determined to succeed, he said.
The family was first taken to the 1st District police station where they stayed for a couple weeks before getting transferred to Wright College with hundreds of other asylum-seekers. The family lived there for about a month before moving into a house with another migrant who was renting an apartment through a city voucher program that offers up to $15,000 for up to six months of rental assistance.
But when rental assistance vanished, neither could afford rent, so they were once again homeless, the father said.
They eventually met someone who offered to rent them an apartment for $750. They managed to afford it because Castejon had found a job in construction, where he was getting paid in cash. But the work was heavy and the pay was not enough, he said, so he left.
Unable to pay rent, the family returned to the 1st District station, where they waited about two weeks before packing their belongings, mostly collected through donations, and headed back to Venezuela.
As the patriarch, he said he felt powerless not being able to provide for his wife and daughter, he said.
“How many more months of living in the streets will it take? No, no more. It’s better that I leave. At least I have my mother back home,” he said angrily.
He said the family decided to seek asylum in the United States because of the extreme poverty in which they were living in Venezuela’s authoritarian regime. But the trip was not worth it, he said.
“We just want to be home,” he said. “If we’re going to be sleeping in the streets here, we’d rather be sleeping in the streets over there.”
The first few colder days influenced the family’s decision to contact staff at Catholic Charities, pressing for plane tickets that would put them closer to a border town to find a way back home. When they got the news that they had been approved and had their tickets in hand, Castejon felt relieved, he said.
The feeling of disappointment and impotency that Castejon felt is shared by many of the migrants, said Brayan Lozano, head of the volunteer group of the Police Station Response Team at the 1st District station.
As an asylum-seeker himself, Lozano understands firsthand the experience the migrants go through: the environment they’ve escaped from their native countries and their expectations for the United States, which may have been influenced by social media and word-of-mouth from the first group of migrants who arrived in Chicago. There may have been more resources when they first came in August 2022, he said.
Even though many, including Castejon’s family, are leaving, others still hope to eventually find shelter in hotel rooms, get access to public services and cash assistance or live out the American Dream.
A proposed ballot question asking Chicagoans whether the city should keep its designation as a sanctuary city has roiled the City Council in recent weeks and immigrant- and Black-led groups gathered Thursday morning across the street from City Hall to urge “solidarity, not division” in responding to the migrant crisis.
“Like many people, we’re just here for a better life. I’m grateful to God and I’m just following a dream to be able to offer more to my family,” said Ana, a Venezuelan teacher who came to Chicago in September because she could not afford to live on the pay she was making at home.
The teacher spoke in Spanish through a translator.
“I am here to continue to advocate for Chicago to be a sanctuary city, for there to be resources for everyone, for us immigrants, to continue to receive the help that we deserve, because everyone deserves a sun to shine on them,” she said.
Lozano said there are several migrants who transitioned from sheltering in suburban hotel rooms into apartments with the help of the city and state resettlement program, received assistance to file their asylum cases, found jobs working under the table, like many people who live in the country without authorization do, and are settling in the city.
But the resources have been exhausted for more recent arrivals and the resettlement program has been trumped by the number of migrants who are arriving.
Lozano said that there is a lot of misinformation flowing within the asylum-seeking community about what is actually happening in Chicago.
As snow and rain have come with the colder temperatures, the reality for migrants stuck sleeping outside of police stations has grown dire. Mattresses are wet, the smell inside tents is sticky, humid and pungent. They eat standing up, rubbing their hands together to keep warm.
“The word of the situation in Chicago is beginning to spread,” Lozano said.
Jose Nauh, 22, decided to give Texas another shot and returned earlier this month after sleeping in a police station in Chicago for more than two weeks.
He came to Chicago even though he has family in Houston because the ticket was free, he said, and he wanted to see what the buzz was all about.
Like Castrejon, he heard there was shelter, food and other public benefits. “That’s not true,” he said.
He grabbed a pink backpack, waved goodbye to Lozano, and rushed into a white car that took him to O’Hare International Airport to board a plane back south.
That same day Diana Vera, her three children and daughter-in law boarded a bus to Detroit, hoping that a cousin would take them in once they arrived.
“We heard that there are a lot of jobs over there even if you don’t have a permit,” the mother said as she brushed her hair while sitting on a blanket on the floor of the police station that had been their home for nearly a month.
Vera also was discouraged from staying after hearing from migrants at city shelters that the conditions are overwhelmed with people, the food is cold and there are no real beds.
“It sounds worse than sleeping at the police station,” she said.

A new Muslim ban. Tariffs on all imported goods and “freedom cities” built on federal land.
Much of the 2024 presidential campaign has been dominated by the myriad investigations into former President Donald Trump and the subsequent charges against him. But with less than a year until Election Day, Trump is dominating the race for the Republican nomination and has already laid out a sweeping set of policy goals should he win a second term.
His ideas, and even the issues he focuses on most, are wildly different from President Joe Biden’s proposals. If implemented, Trump’s plans would represent a dramatic government overhaul arguably more consequential than that of his first term. His presidency, especially the early days, was marked by chaos, infighting and a wave of hastily written executive orders that were quickly overturned by the courts.
Some of his current ideas would probably end up in court or impeded by Congress. But Trump’s campaign and allied groups are assembling policy books with detailed plans.
A look at his agenda:
DISMANTLING THE âDEEP STATEâ
Trump would try to strip tens of thousands of career employees of their civil service protections. That way, they could be fired as he seeks to “totally obliterate the deep state.”
He would try to accomplish that by reissuing a 2020 executive order known as âSchedule F.â That would allow him to reclassify masses of employees, with a particular focus, he has said, on âcorrupt bureaucrats who have weaponized our justice systemâ and âcorrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus.â Given his anger at the FBI and federal prosecutors pursuing criminal cases against him, Trump probably would target people linked to those prosecutions for retribution.
Beyond the firings, he wants to crack down on government officials who leak to reporters. He also wants to require that federal employees pass a new civil service test.
THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER
Trump has pledged to âimmediately stop the invasion of our southern borderâ and end illegal immigration.
As part of that plan, he says he would immediately direct U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to undertake the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. He would target people who are legally living in the United States but harbor âjihadist sympathies” and revoke the student visas of those who espouse anti-American and antisemitic views.
In a bid to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump says he will move thousands of troops currently stationed overseas and shift federal agents, including those at the Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI, to immigration enforcement. He also wants to build more of the border wall.
Trump wants to reimpose his travel ban that originally targeted seven Muslim-majority countries and expand it to âkeep radical Islamic terrorists out of the country.â In the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel, he has pledged to put in place âideological screeningâ for immigrants. His aim: bar âdangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs,â as well as those who âempathize with radical Islamic terrorists and extremists.”
To deter migrants, he has said he would end birthright citizenship, using an an executive order that would introduce a legally untested interpretation of the 14th Amendment. The order would prevent federal agencies from granting automatic citizenship to the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally. It would require that at least one parent be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for their children to be eligible for passports, Social Security numbers and other benefits.
TRADE
Trump says he will institute a system of tariffs of perhaps 10% on most foreign goods. Penalties would increase if trade partners manipulate their currencies or engage in other unfair trading practices.
He will urge that Congress pass a âTrump Reciprocal Trade Act,” giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S.
Much of the agenda focuses on China. Trump has proposed a four-year plan to phase out Chinese imports of essential goods, including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals. He wants to ban Chinese companies from owning vital U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and agriculture, and says he will force Chinese owners to sell any holdings âthat jeopardize Americaâs national security.â
FOREIGN POLICY
Trump claims that even before he is inaugurated, he will have settled the war between Russia and Ukraine. That includes, he says, ending the âendless flow of American treasure to Ukraineâ and asking European allies to reimburse the U.S. for the cost of rebuilding stockpiles.
It is unclear whether he would insist that Russia withdraw from territory in Ukraine it seized in the war that it launched in February 2022.
Trump has said he will stand with Israel in its war with Hamas and support Israel’s efforts to âdestroyâ the militant group. He says he will continue to âfundamentally reevaluateâ NATOâs purpose and mission.
TRANSGENDER RIGHTS
Trump says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that âonly two genders,â as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States.
As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he will declare that hospitals and health care providers that offer transitional hormones or surgery no longer meet federal health and safety standards and will be blocked from receiving federal funds, including Medicaid and Medicare dollars.
He would push Congress to prohibit hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors in all 50 states.
Doctors typically guide kids toward therapy before medical intervention. At that point, hormone treatments such as puberty blockers are far more common than surgery. They have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are standard treatments backed by major doctorsâ organizations, including the American Medical Association.
ENERGY
Trump’s goal, he says, is for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, including China.
Under the mantra âDRILL, BABY, DRILL,â he says he would ramp up oil drilling on public lands and offer tax breaks to oil, gas, and coal producers. He would roll back Biden administration efforts to encourage the adoption of electric cars and reverse proposed new pollution limits that would require at least 54% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.
And again, he says, he will exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden admiration targeting incandescent lightbulbs, gas stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.
EDUCATION
Trump has pledged to terminate the Department of Education, but he also wants to exert enormous influence over local school districts and colleges.
He would push the federal government to give funding preference to states and school districts that abolish teacher tenure, adopt merit pay to reward good teachers and allow the direct election of school principals by parents.
He has said he would cut funding for any school that has a vaccine or mask mandate and will promote prayer in public schools.
Trump also wants a say in school curricula, vowing to fight for âpatriotic education.” He says that under his administration, schools will âteach students to love their country, not to hate their country like theyâre taught right now” and will promote âthe nuclear familyâ including âthe roles of mothers and fathers” and the âthings that make men and women different and unique.â
To protect students, he says he will support school districts that allow trained teachers to carry concealed weapons. He would provide federal funding so schools can hire veterans, retired police officers, and other trained gun owners as armed school guards.
HOMELESSNESS
Trump wants to force the homeless off city streets by building tent cities on large open parcels of inexpensive land. At the same time, he says he will work with states to ban urban camping, giving violators the choice between being arrested or receiving treatment.
He also wants to bring back large mental institutions to reinstitutionalize those who are âseverely mentally illâ or “dangerously deranged.”
PUBLIC SAFETY
Trump would again push to send the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violence. He would use the federal government’s funding and prosecution authorities to strong-arm local governments.
He says he will require local law enforcement agencies that receive Justice Department grants to use controversial policing measures such as stop-and-frisk. As a deterrent, he says local police should be empowered to shoot suspected shoplifters in the act. âVery simply, if you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store,â he said in one recent speech.
Trump has called for the death penalty for drug smugglers and those who traffic women and children. He has also pledged a federal takeover of the nation’s capital, calling Washington a âdirty, crime-ridden death trap” unbefitting of the country.",N

Two other people were later found dead inside a home in Austin, according to interim Police Chief Robin Henderson.
An emotional Henderson, who paused often during a news conference and appeared to be choking back tears, said officers were called to the home shortly before 3 a.m. Saturday by a woman screaming that she was being stabbed.
One person escaped the home before officers arrived, Henderson said, and told police the man in the home was armed with a knife.
Police then tried to enter the home and were met with gunfire, but did not return fire, retreated and called for a SWAT team, said Henderson, who did not take questions and was surrounded by about 10 other officers during her comments.
âSWAT officers arrived on scene and forced entry into the residence … to rescue the victims,â Henderson said. âAs SWAT officers entered the suspect immediately fired his gun at the officers and the SWAT officers returned fire.â
Two officers and the suspect were struck by the gunfire. The suspect was killed at the scene and the two officers were taken to a hospital, where one died and the second was in stable condition, Henderson said.
âTwo apparent victims of the suspect were located inside of the residence with fatal injuries,â Henderson said.
Multiple officers opened fire, and the shooting will be investigated by both the Austin Police Department’s internal affairs division and the department’s special investigation unit in conjunction with the Travis County District Attorney’s Office, Henderson said.
No names have been released.
âIâm praying for the family of our fallen officer,â Austin Mayor Kirk Watson said in a statement, and âfor our officer who was shot and in surgery and his family.â
âWe rely on brave people who are in harmâs way when they are serving us,â Watson said. âThis event jarringly brings home that truth.â
The Austin Police Retired Officers Association asked for prayers for both the slain and the wounded officer.
âOur hearts are heavy this morning with the news of one of our brothers with APD having been shot and killed in the line of duty,â the statement said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Gov. Greg Abbott also issued a statement calling for prayers for the family of the slain officer, for the wounded officer and for the city’s police department.
âThis tragedy is a reminder of the great risks and selfless leadership our law enforcement officers exercise every day to serve and protect their communities,â Abbott said.",N
"Sweeping raids, camps and mass deportations: Trump’s 2025 immigration plans",2023-11-11,2023-11-13T04:43:23Z,en,seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/sweeping-raids-camps-and-mass-deportations-trumps-2025-immigration-plans/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231113044323id_/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/sweeping-raids-camps-and-mass-deportations-trumps-2025-immigration-plans/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231113044323/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/sweeping-raids-camps-and-mass-deportations-trumps-2025-immigration-plans/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcykvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL3N3ZWVwaW5nLXJhaWRzLWNhbXBzLWFuZC1tYXNzLWRlcG9ydGF0aW9ucy10cnVtcHMtMjAyNS1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi1wbGFucz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cnNzX2FsbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9cnNz,"Former President Donald Trump is planning an extreme expansion of his first-term crackdown on immigration if he returns to power in 2025 — including preparing to round up people living in the United States without legal permission on a vast scale and detain them in sprawling camps while they wait to be expelled.
The plans would sharply restrict both legal and illegal immigration in a multitude of ways.
Trump wants to revive his first-term border policies, including banning entry by people from certain Muslim-majority nations and reimposing a COVID-19-era policy of refusing asylum claims — although this time, he would base that refusal on assertions that migrants carry other infectious diseases like tuberculosis.
He plans to scour the country for immigrants living here without legal permission and deport people by the millions per year.
To help speed mass deportations, Trump is preparing an enormous expansion of a form of removal that does not require due-process hearings. To help Immigration and Customs Enforcement carry out sweeping raids, he plans to reassign other federal agents and deputize local police officers and National Guard soldiers voluntarily contributed by Republican-run states.
To ease the strain on ICE detention facilities, Trump wants to build huge camps to detain people while their cases are processed and they await deportation flights. And to get around any refusal by Congress to appropriate the necessary funds, Trump would redirect money in the military budget, as he did in his first term to spend more on a border wall than Congress had authorized.
In a public reference to his plans, Trump told a crowd in Iowa in September, “Following the Eisenhower model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.” The reference was to a 1954 campaign to round up and expel Mexican immigrants that was named for an ethnic slur.
The constellation of Trump’s 2025 plans amounts to an assault on immigration on a scale unseen in modern American history. Millions of immigrants living in the country without legal permission would be banned from the U.S. or uprooted from it years or even decades after settling here.
Such a scale of planned removals would raise logistical, financial and diplomatic challenges and would be vigorously challenged in court. But there is no mistaking the breadth and ambition of the shift Trump is eyeing.
In a second Trump presidency, the visas of foreign students who participated in anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian protests would be canceled. U.S. consular officials abroad will be directed to expand ideological screening of visa applicants to block people the Trump administration considers to have undesirable attitudes. People who were granted temporary protected status because they are from certain countries deemed unsafe, allowing them to lawfully live and work in the United States, would have that status revoked.
Similarly, numerous people who have been allowed to live in the country temporarily for humanitarian reasons would also lose that status and be kicked out, including tens of thousands of the Afghans who were evacuated amid the 2021 Taliban takeover and allowed to enter the United States. Afghans holding special visas granted to people who helped U.S. forces would be revetted to see if they really did.
And Trump would try to end birthright citizenship for babies born in the United States to parents living in the country without legal permission — by proclaiming that policy to be the new position of the government and by ordering agencies to cease issuing citizenship-affirming documents like Social Security cards and passports to them. That policy’s legal legitimacy, like nearly all of Trump’s plans, would be virtually certain to end up before the Supreme Court.
In interviews with The New York Times, several Trump advisers gave the most expansive and detailed description yet of Trump’s immigration agenda in a potential second term. In particular, Trump’s campaign referred questions for this article to Stephen Miller, an architect of Trump’s first-term immigration policies who remains close to him and is expected to serve in a senior role in a second administration.
All of the steps Trump advisers are preparing, Miller contended in a wide-ranging interview, rely on existing statutes; while the Trump team would likely seek a revamp of immigration laws, the plan was crafted to need no new substantive legislation. And while acknowledging that lawsuits would arise to challenge nearly every one of them, he portrayed the Trump team’s daunting array of tactics as a “blitz” designed to overwhelm immigrant rights lawyers.
“Any activists who doubt President Trump’s resolve in the slightest are making a drastic error. Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown,” Miller said, adding, “The immigration legal activists won’t know what’s happening.”
Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration and criminal justice advocacy group that repeatedly fought the Trump administration, said the Trump team’s plans relied on “xenophobic demagoguery” that appeals to his hardest-core political base.
“Americans should understand these policy proposals are an authoritarian, often illegal, agenda that would rip apart nearly every aspect of American life — tanking the economy, violating the basic civil rights of millions of immigrants and native-born Americans alike,” Schulte said.
The tools to exploit
Since Trump left office, the political environment on immigration has moved in his direction. He is also more capable now of exploiting that environment if he is reelected than he was when he first won election as an outsider.
The ebbing of the COVID-19 pandemic and resumption of travel flows have helped stir a global migrant crisis, with millions of Venezuelans and Central Americans fleeing turmoil and Africans arriving in Latin American countries before continuing their journey north. Amid the record numbers of migrants at the southern border and beyond it in cities like New York and Chicago, voters are frustrated, and even some Democrats are calling for tougher action against immigrants and pressuring the White House to better manage the crisis.
Trump and his advisers see the opening and now know better how to seize it. The aides Trump relied upon in the chaotic early days of his first term were sometimes at odds and lacked experience in how to manipulate the levers of federal power. By the end of his first term, Cabinet officials and lawyers who sought to restrain some of his actions — like his Homeland Security secretary and chief of staff, John Kelly — had been fired, and those who stuck with him had learned much.
In a second term, Trump plans to install a team that will not restrain him.
Since much of Trump’s first-term immigration crackdown was tied up in the courts, the legal environment has tilted in his favor: His four years of judicial appointments left behind federal appellate courts and a Supreme Court that are far more conservative than the courts that heard challenges to his first-term policies.
The fight over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals provides an illustration.
DACA is an Obama-era program that shields from deportation and grants work permits to people who were brought unlawfully to the United States as children. Trump tried to end it, but the Supreme Court blocked him on procedural grounds in June 2020.
Miller said Trump would try again to end DACA. And the 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court that blocked the last attempt no longer exists: A few months after the DACA ruling, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, and Trump replaced her with a sixth conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
Trump’s rhetoric has more than kept up with his increasingly extreme agenda on immigration.
His stoking of fear and anger toward immigrants — pushing for a border wall and calling Mexicans rapists — fueled his 2016 takeover of the Republican Party. As president, he privately mused about developing a militarized border like Israel’s, asked whether migrants crossing the border could be shot in the legs and wanted a proposed border wall topped with flesh-piercing spikes and painted black to burn migrants’ skin.
As he has campaigned for the party’s third straight presidential nomination, his anti-immigrant tone has only grown harsher. In a recent interview with a right-wing website, Trump claimed without evidence that foreign leaders were deliberately emptying their “insane asylums” to send the patients across America’s southern border as migrants. He said migrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.” And at a rally Wednesday in Florida, he compared them to the fictional serial killer and cannibal Hannibal Lecter, saying, “That’s what’s coming into our country right now.”
Trump had similarly vowed to carry out mass deportations when running for office in 2016, but the government only managed several hundred thousand removals per year under his presidency, on par with other recent administrations. If they get another opportunity, Trump and his team are determined to achieve annual numbers in the millions.
Keeping people out
Trump’s immigration plan is to pick up where he left off and then go much further. He would not only revive some of the policies that were criticized as draconian during his presidency, many of which the Biden White House ended, but also expand and toughen them.
One example centers on expanding first-term policies aimed at keeping people out of the country. Trump plans to suspend the nation’s refugee program and once again categorically ban visitors from troubled countries, reinstating a version of his ban on travel from several mostly Muslim-majority countries, which President Joe Biden called discriminatory and ended on his first day in office.
Trump would also use coercive diplomacy to induce other nations to help, including by making cooperation a condition of any other bilateral engagement, Miller said. For example, a second Trump administration would seek to reestablish an agreement with Mexico that asylum-seekers remain there while their claims are processed. (It is not clear that Mexico would agree; a Mexican court has said that deal violated human rights.)
Trump would also push to revive “safe third country” agreements with several nations in Central America and try to expand them to Africa, Asia and South America. Under such deals, countries agree to take would-be asylum-seekers from specific other nations and let them apply for asylum there instead.
While such arrangements have traditionally only covered migrants who had previously passed through a third country, federal law does not require that limit, and a second Trump administration would seek to make those deals without it, in part as a deterrent to migrants making what the Trump team views as illegitimate asylum claims.
At the same time, Miller said, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would invoke the public health emergency powers law known as Title 42 to again refuse to hear any asylum claims by people arriving at the southern border. The Trump administration had internally discussed that idea early in Trump’s term, but some Cabinet secretaries pushed back, arguing that there was no public health emergency that would legally justify it. The administration ultimately implemented it during the coronavirus pandemic.
Saying the idea has since gained acceptance in practice — Biden initially kept the policy — Miller said Trump would invoke Title 42, citing “severe strains of the flu, tuberculosis, scabies, other respiratory illnesses like RSV and so on, or just a general issue of mass migration being a public health threat and conveying a variety of communicable diseases.”
Trump and his aides have not yet said whether they would reenact one of the most contentious deterrents to unauthorized immigration that he pursued as president: separating children from their parents, which led to trauma among migrants and difficulties in reuniting families. When pressed, Trump has repeatedly declined to rule out reviving the policy. After an outcry over the practice, Trump ended it in 2018, and a judge later blocked the government from putting it back into effect.
Mass deportations
Soon after Trump announced his 2024 campaign for president last November, he met with Tom Homan, who ran ICE for the first year and a half of the Trump administration and was an early proponent of separating families to deter migrants.
In an interview, Homan recalled that in that meeting, he “agreed to come back” in a second term and would “help to organize and run the largest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”
Trump advisers’ vision of abrupt mass deportations would be a recipe for social and economic turmoil, disrupting the housing market and major industries including agriculture and the service sector.
Miller cast such disruption in a favorable light.
“Mass deportation will be a labor-market disruption celebrated by American workers, who will now be offered higher wages with better benefits to fill these jobs,” he said. “Americans will also celebrate the fact that our nation’s laws are now being applied equally and that one select group is no longer magically exempt.”
One planned step to overcome the legal and logistical hurdles would be to significantly expand a form of fast-track deportations known as “expedited removal.” It denies immigrants living in the country without legal permission the usual hearings and opportunity to file appeals, which can take months or years — especially when people are not in custody — and has led to a large backlog. A 1996 law says people can be subject to expedited removal for up to two years after arriving, but to date, the executive branch has used it more cautiously, swiftly expelling people picked up near the border soon after crossing.
The Trump administration tried to expand the use of expedited removal, but a court blocked it, and then the Biden team canceled the expansion. It remains unclear whether the Supreme Court will rule that it is constitutional to use the law against people who have been living for a significant period in the United States and express fear of persecution if sent home.
Trump has also said he would invoke an archaic law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to expel suspected members of drug cartels and criminal gangs without due process. That law allows for summary deportation of people from countries with which the United States is at war, that have invaded the United States or that have engaged in “predatory incursions.”
The Supreme Court has upheld past uses of that law in wartime. But its text seems to require a link to the actions of a foreign government, so it is not clear whether the justices will allow a president to stretch it to encompass drug cartel activity.
More broadly, Miller said a new Trump administration would shift from the ICE practice of arresting specific people to carrying out workplace raids and other sweeps in public places aimed at arresting scores of immigrants living in the country without legal permission all at once.
To make the process of finding and deporting immigrants already living inside the country without legal permission “radically more quick and efficient,” he said, the Trump team would bring in “the right kinds of attorneys and the right kinds of policy thinkers” willing to carry out such ideas.
And because of the magnitude of arrests and deportations being contemplated, they plan to build “vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers” for immigrants as their cases progress and they wait to be flown to other countries.
Miller said the new camps would likely be built “on open land in Texas near the border.” He said the military would construct them under the authority and control of the Department of Homeland Security. While he cautioned that there were no specific blueprints yet, he said the camps would look professional and similar to other facilities for migrants that have been built near the border.
Such camps could also enable the government to speed up the pace and volume of deportations of people who have lived in the United States without legal permission for years and so are not subject to fast-track removal. If pursuing a longshot effort to win permission to remain in the country would mean staying locked up in the interim, some may give up and voluntarily accept removal without going through the full process.
The use of these camps, he said, would likely be focused more on single adults because the government cannot indefinitely hold children under a long-standing court order known as the Flores settlement. So any families brought to the facilities would have to be moved in and out more quickly, Miller said.
The Trump administration tried to overturn the Flores settlement, but the Supreme Court did not resolve the matter before Trump’s term ended. Miller said the Trump team would try again.
To increase the number of agents available for ICE sweeps, Miller said, officials from other federal law enforcement agencies would be temporarily reassigned, and state National Guard troops and local police officers, at least from willing Republican-led states, would be deputized for immigration control efforts.
While a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the use of the armed forces for law enforcement purposes, another law called the Insurrection Act creates an exception. Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act at the border, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants, Miller said.
“Bottom line,” he said, “President Trump will do whatever it takes.”",N
Gun case forces Supreme Court to confront its own illogic,2023-11-10,2023-11-11T04:26:05Z,en,seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/gun-case-forces-supreme-court-to-confront-its-own-illogic/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111042605id_/https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/gun-case-forces-supreme-court-to-confront-its-own-illogic/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111042605/https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/gun-case-forces-supreme-court-to-confront-its-own-illogic/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcykvb3Bpbmlvbi9ndW4tY2FzZS1mb3JjZXMtc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC10by1jb25mcm9udC1pdHMtb3duLWlsbG9naWM_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXJzc19hbGwmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1yZWZlcnJhbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPXJzcw~~,"The good news is that the U.S. Supreme Court seems poised to reverse a Fifth Circuit decision that said police can’t confiscate guns from domestic abusers. The bad news is that the high court’s 2022 Bruen decision, which guided the lower court’s ruling, remains firmly in place.
Bruen is among the worst-reasoned Supreme Court decisions in recent memory. And even after the justices rule on the case currently before them, Bruen’s precedent will still be difficult for lower courts to apply given the decision’s confused logic.
The specific case the justices considered during oral argument Tuesday involved one Zackey Rahimi, a Texan with a history of assaulting his girlfriend, threatening people with guns, and even firing shots into the air after a friend’s credit card was declined at a Whataburger. A state court in Texas that issued a protective order keeping Rahimi away from his girlfriend triggered a federal law that prohibits people subject to domestic violence protective orders from possessing firearms.
All that sounds entirely sensible in a world where shootings are tragically common. It’s hard to imagine any reasonable person thinking that it would be a good idea to let someone in Rahimi’s situation keep his guns.
Yet common sense did not deter the lower federal courts in Rahimi’s case from ruling the federal law unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. Those courts were interpreting the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision, which held that gun laws must match the “historical tradition” of earlier gun restrictions in U.S. history.
Faced with this extremely amorphous pseudo-test, the lower courts said that there was no historical tradition of taking guns from domestic abusers. On that basis, they held that Rahimi could not be stripped of his Second Amendment right to bear arms.
Bruen ranged widely over historical evidence dating from the 14th to the 20th century in the course of overturning New York’s concealed carry ordinance. Bruen left it to the lower courts to review the constitutionality of essentially 100% of all existing gun laws without further guidance on what it could mean to match “the historical tradition.”
It’s worth noting that the Bruen did not tell the lower courts to follow the original meaning of the Second Amendment, despite the fact that the case’s author, Justice Clarence Thomas, is supposed to be an originalist. The reason, no doubt, is that the original meaning of the Second Amendment is clearly spelled out in the amendment’s own text, which explains that the purpose of the amendment is to ensure the existence of a “well regulated militia.”
The framers, always worried about their fragile republic devolving into an autocratic empire as Rome had done, wanted to make sure that the states would maintain citizen militias of the kind that fought the Revolutionary War. They didn’t dream of a world where husbands frequently killed their wives with handguns, much less one where assault rifles are regularly used to murder en masse, as occurred most recently in Lewiston, Maine.
Unwilling or unable to rely on the amendment’s original meaning, Thomas and the conservative majority instead concocted the novel legal category of “historical tradition.” The trouble is that no one, lawyer or otherwise, knows what it means to decide cases by historical tradition.
When evaluating current gun laws, many lower courts have simply looked to the past to see if identical gun laws can be found. Unsurprisingly, such parallels rarely exist. Protective orders are a product of our contemporary concern for vulnerable domestic partners. Even the legal category of domestic violence is relatively new.
To resolve the case with any modicum of protection for the public, the justices will have to create some sort of category of people whose gun rights are not absolutely protected. The leading candidate in the oral argument was the category of “dangerous” people — people who may not have been convicted of a crime, but are nonetheless deemed by the court system to pose a probable danger.
But this is a stopgap measure, one that will now put lower courts in the position of having to guess what other categories might exist and how they can be derived from historical analogies rooted in “tradition.”
Until the Bruen decision, courts treated Second Amendment rights like other constitutional rights, weighing them against the government’s interest in essential goals like public safety. With its loose historical tradition test, the court in Bruen rejected that familiar framework. The Rahimi case shows what happens when the justices throw the norms of legal reasoning to the wind: The courts make poor decisions that leave us less safe.
The Bruen precedent is bad law, bad logic and bad history. It needs to be overturned — not “applied” in subsequent cases that produce unsound constitutional doctrine and unsafe homes.",N

Two people were killed and nine seriously wounded in the shooting at three locations, chiefly outside the London Pub, a popular gay bar, on June 25, 2022.
Prosecutor Sturla HenriksbÃ¸ said that Zaniar Matapour, 44, fired 10 rounds with a machine gun and eight shots with a handgun into a crowd at a street corner in the nightlife district where there were a total of 560 people. Before that, he took âan oath of allegiance to the Islamic State group.”
âThe attack caused great fear,â HenriksbÃ¸ said. One of the victims was hit by four bullets, while the other one was killed by a single shot.
Matapour was arrested shortly after by bystanders and has has since been held on suspicion of being the shooter. Following the attack, a Pride parade was canceled, with the police saying they could not guarantee security. Matapour has refused to speak to investigators.
Another prosecutor, Aud Kinsarvik GravÃ¥s, said four other suspects were linked to the shooting but they have not been charged as the investigation is still ongoing. Two of them are outside Norway. One of those suspected in the case is a leading Norwegian radical Islamist who is in hiding in Pakistan. The whereabouts of the other one was not known.
âWe believe that it will take some time before they return to Norway,â she said. âIt is important to stress that even if the charge only applies to Matapour, it does not mean that the suspicion against the others in the case has weakened.â
The trial against Matapour who reportedly arrived in Norway with his family from a Kurdish part of Iran in the 1990s, is scheduled to start in March and last for two months. If found guilty, he faces 30 years in prison.
The shooting shocked Norway, which has a relatively low crime rate but has experienced a series of so-called lone wolf attacks in recent decades, including one of the worst mass shootings in Europe. In 2011, a right-wing extremist killed 69 people on the island of Utoya after setting off a bomb in Oslo that left eight dead.
In 2019, another right-wing extremist killed his stepsister and then opened fire in a mosque but was overpowered before anyone there was injured.
Two years later, a Norwegian man armed with knives and a bow and arrow killed five people in a town in the south of the country. The attacker, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was sentenced Friday to compulsory psychiatric care.",N

(São Paulo) – The initial steps taken by civil and ‘scientific’ police to investigate 28 killings during a July 2023 military police operation in Baixada Santista, in São Paulo state, Brazil, have been inadequate and did not comply with international standards, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Tuesday.
In the 19-page report, “‘They Promised to Kill 30’: Police Killings in Baixada Santista, São Paulo State, Brazil,” describes the important failures in the initial steps of police investigations. Law enforcement officers initiated the so-called Escudo (“shield”) operation in Baixada Santista, a metropolitan area on the coast of São Paulo state, on July 28, 2023, in response to the killing of an officer in the city of Guarujá. By September 5, when the operation ended, the military police had killed 28 people, making it one of the deadliest police operations in São Paulo state in 3 decades. Another three officers were also injured during the operation.
“The initial investigations into the 28 killings by civil and ‘scientific’ police in São Paulo state have been woefully inadequate and do not meet international standards,” said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “Thorough, independent, and prompt investigations, including proper forensic analysis, are crucial and need to be led by prosecutors instead of relying on police investigators.”
The civil police functions as state judicial police and investigates most criminal offenses and works in close collaboration with the ‘scientific police,’ which is responsible for carrying out forensic analysis.
Human Rights Watch examined police reports into 27 of the killings and 15 autopsy reports; interviewed authorities, family members of victims, and community members; and documented threats against the state police ombudsperson.
At Human Rights Watch’s request, the Independent Forensic Expert Group of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, an international group of pre-eminent forensic experts, reviewed 15 preliminary autopsy reports and found they did not comply with international standards. The expert opinion concluded that “based on the preliminary autopsy reports, the postmortem examinations of the fifteen individuals are ineffective and fail to meet minimum acceptable standards on the investigation of firearm related deaths in the context of police action.”
Brazil has long had a serious problem with excessive use of force by police. Police killed more than 6,400 people in 2022, according to the nonprofit Brazilian Forum of Public Security, which compiles the data from official sources at the state level. While some killings by police are in self defense, many result from excessive use of force, contributing to a cycle of violence that undermines public security and endangers the lives of civilians and police alike. Human Rights Watch has identified serious failures in civil police investigations into killings by police.
On-duty police killings increased 86 percent in the third trimester of 2023 in São Paulo state when compared to the same period of 2022.
Human Rights Watch sent an information request on the investigative steps taken, but neither the São Paulo public security secretary nor the civil police chief have provided the information.
Among the concerns are the following:
- Of the 26 police reports reviewed, police failed in 6 to request forensic analysis of the shooting sites, and 3 others noted that no forensic analysis of the site would be conducted, in one case because it was raining.
- Civil police took statements from military police officers in groups, instead of individually, in at least 12 out of 26 cases, making it extremely difficult to independently corroborate the information given.
- In at least seven cases, São Paulo forensic experts noted bodies arrived without clothes for the autopsy. The international forensic experts said it is essential to collect samples of clothes and from skin to help clarify the “manner and circumstances of the death.”
- Military police officers claimed in 20 of the 26 police reports that they opened fire after the victims shot at them. In the other six they said the person pulled a gun and was about to shoot. But civil police did not request gunshot residue tests in 9 cases, in 2 of the other cases requested tests of the victims and in 3 only of the officers.
- There is some police body camera footage for only 9 of the 28 killings, according to the São Paulo Attorney General’s Office.
São Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas initially said that police had committed no abuses during the operation. As the death toll increased, he said the authorities would investigate police conduct and “punish those responsible” in case of “excesses” or “failures.” But the state public security secretary said that the authorities do not seek to engage in a report of a shootout, and that the 28 people had “made their choice.”
On October 16, the governor gave awards to some of the officers who were part of Operation Escudo.
The São Paulo Attorney General’s Office opened criminal investigations into the 28 killings, as well as a civil investigation into human rights violations, along with an administrative proceeding to monitor the investigations carried out by civil police.
In recent years, numerous police operations following the killing of an officer have resulted in substantial numbers of police killings throughout Brazil. Studies in Rio de Janeiro suggest police are more likely to kill during such operations.
Public security authorities in São Paulo, other states, and at the federal level should adopt protocols to prevent “revenge operations,” Human Rights Watch said. Steps should include ensuring that police officers from units whose members have been killed receive immediate psychological and social support and do not participate in operations in response to the officer’s killing. Body cameras should be worn by all officers involved in the operation. In addition, the Public Security Secretariat should always send a written explanation with the operational plan to the Attorney General’s Office and should routinely inform the state police ombudsperson’s office of all police operations initiated after a police officer is killed, Human Rights Watch said.
“Some of the deadliest police operations in Brazil, such as Operation Escudo in Baixada Santista, have been conducted in response to the killing of a police officer,” Goebertus said. “Public security authorities should take immediate measures to prevent revenge operations and uphold the law.”",N

(AP) â A Tennessee college student who was hit by a stray bullet while walking near Belmont University campus died overnight Wednesday, according to Metro Nashville Police.
Jillian Ludwig, of New Jersey, was walking on a track in a local park when she was shot in the head and critically wounded at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to police. They arrested Shaquille Taylor, 29, after surveillance video and witness statements pointed to him as the shooter. Video showed Ludwig falling as Taylor fired at a nearby car, according to a police affidavit. A passerby discovered Ludwig, 18, on the ground about an hour later, and she was transported to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Ludwig’s shooting prompted Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk to send out a statement on Wednesday detailing Taylor’s previous criminal history. That includes three charges of assault with a deadly weapon from 2021 after he was accused of shooting at a female driver while her two children were in the back seat. Earlier this year a Nashville judge dismissed the charges when three doctors testified that Taylor was incompetent to stand trial because he is severely intellectually disabled. Both federal and state law prohibit the prosecution of mentally incompetent defendants.
Because Taylor did not qualify for involuntary commitment to a mental health institution, he was simply released from prison. Funk said Tennessee lawmakers need to make it easier to involuntarily commit a person, calling the current standards ânearly impossibleâ to meet.
Belmont University President Greg Jones, in an email to students, said Ludwig was a music business major and bass player who often cheered on her fellow musicians at concerts. She was also an avid runner who enjoyed being outside.
A public defender listed as Taylor’s attorney in court records did not return phone and email messages seeking comment.",N

Nestor Hernandez, 31, was found guilty of capital murder in the October 2022 shooting deaths of Jacqueline Pokuaa, 45, a social worker, and Katie Annette Flowers, 63, a nurse, at Methodist Dallas Medical Center. He received an automatic sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors didn’t seek the death penalty.
Defense attorneys had asked jurors to consider a lesser charge, acknowledging that Hernandez opened fire but saying he didnât mean to kill anyone. Taking the stand at the trial, Hernandez admitted to shooting the two women but said it was an accident.
Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot told jurors that Hernandez went to the hospital that day with ârage, resentment, anger and a plan to kill.â Prosecutor George Lewis said Hernandez was motivated by a belief that his girlfriend had cheated on him and he wasnât the babyâs father. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that he was.
Hernandez’s girlfriend, Selena Villatoro, testified that he accused her of infidelity and hit her with a pistol. She said he threatened to kill her, himself and anyone who came into the room, and when Pokuaa then entered, Hernandez shot her.
Hernandez testified that as he and Villatoro fought, Pokuaa tried to intervene and the gun misfired. He said he then shot into the hallway in a panic, striking Flowers.
Hernandez was shot in the thigh by a hospital police officer who arrived on the scene.
At the time of the shooting, Hernandez was on parole for aggravated robbery and had been granted permission to be at the hospital while wearing an ankle monitor.",N

No one was struck by the gunshots Tuesday inside the station, located a few blocks north of Times Square.
Authorities said John Rote, 43, intervened when a man who had been asking riders for money near the turnstiles at around 9 p.m. tried to grab a 40-year-old woman’s purse.
According to prosecutors, he pulled a gun from his bag and fired at least one shot on the platform, before fleeing the scene and disposing of his firearm.
Security camera footage published in the New York Post showed part of the confrontation.
“I’ve looked at the video,” New York City Transit President Richard Davey said at a news conference Wednesday. “It’s, I would say unusual. He sort of looks very calm, pulls out a gun, fires two shots, calmly puts the gun back in the bag and walks away.”
“The point is, that’s not what we need from anybody in this system,” he said.
Rote is originally from West Virginia and has ties out of state, but no criminal history, according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
“Thank goodness nobody was hurt here — but what happened was outrageous, reckless, and unacceptable,” Davey said in a statement released after Rote was arrested.
Police also arrested Matthew Roesch, 49, Tuesday night on a charge of attempted robbery.
Authorities said Roesh was holding an emergency gate open to let riders avoid paying the fare and then asking for money in return. His attorney could not immediately be reached.
When the 40-year-old woman declined to pay him, “it looks like he attempted to steal her purse,” Davey said.
Although the New York City subway system has been plagued by problems including fare evasion and aggressive panhandling, it is rare for riders to take law enforcement into their own hands.
Rote’s arrest recalled the death earlier this year of Jordan Neely, a onetime Michael Jackson impersonator who was placed in a fatal chokehold after witnesses said he was begging for money and acting in a threatening manner aboard a subway train.
U.S. Marine veteran Daniel Penny has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in Neely’s May 1 death.
In New York’s most infamous example of vigilante subway violence, Bernhard Goetz shot four young Black men on a subway train in 1984 after one of them asked him for $5. Goetz, who is white, said he thought he was being robbed. A jury acquitted him of attempted murder but convicted him of carrying an unlicensed handgun.",N

(AP) — The ex-Louisville police officer on trial for firing into Breonna Taylor’s apartment the night she was killed testified Thursday he had to react quickly after a fellow officer was shot in the leg during the drug raid.
Brett Hankison said he saw a muzzle flash come from inside Taylor’s hallway after officers knocked down the door in the early hours of March 13, 2020, to execute a search warrant. He testified he believed it sounded like an assault rifle, so he moved to the side of Taylor’s apartment and fired shots in through a sliding glass door and window.
“I had to react,” Hankison said on the witness stand in U.S. District Court Thursday. “I had no choice.”
Taylor’s boyfriend had fired a single shot at officers after they came through the door, and two officers at the entry returned fire, striking and killing Taylor in the hallway of her apartment.
While no one was hit by the 10 shots he fired, prosecutors have argued Hankison was shooting erratically without identifying a target. Some of his gunshots went into an occupied neighboring apartment.
Hankison said he moved away from the entry door, rounded the corner of the apartment and sprayed bullets into the side windows and sliding glass door because he believed a shooter was advancing on officers in the doorway. He said he believed the officers “were taking automatic gunfire and were trapped.” The officers at the door fired a combined 22 shots after Taylor’s boyfriend fired a single round.
“It sounded like he was walking up on us … like he was executing” the other officers, Hankison said.
Hankison, 47, has been charged with two federal civil rights violations for endangering Taylor, her boyfriend and Taylor’s neighbors, who shared a wall with her apartment. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Federal prosecutors are attempting to do what Kentucky prosecutors couldn’t — convict Hankison for his actions on the night Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death. He was acquitted by a jury last year of wanton endangerment charges.
Prosecutors at this trial have argued Hankison did not follow police use of force policies when he decided to fire through Taylor’s windows and sliding door. When his attorney asked him about that, he said he “didn’t have time to think about a policy.”
“You’re acting to save lives, or not acting and people are going to die,” Hankison said.
Hankison said he feels “horrible” about Taylor’s death and that it was “tragic for a lot of people and a lot of families.” Her death along with George Floyd’s at the hands of Minneapolis police officers sparked weeks of protests over police brutality in the summer of 2020.
Hankison was also critical of the warrant, saying he and the other officers should have never been sent to her apartment that night. The Taylor warrant was one of five served simultaneously the night she was killed, part of a wide-ranging narcotics operation targeting a known drug dealer. The dealer was located in another part of town but had a previous relationship with Taylor.
Three other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant have been charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany in their trial next year.
The former Louisville officer shot by Taylor’s boyfriend during the raid, Jonathan Mattingly, also testified Thursday, saying he was standing in front of the door when it opened and saw a muzzle flash in the dark. He said he saw two figures at the end of the hallway before he was shot.
Mattingly, who retired from the police force in 2021, said he couldn’t tell where Hankison was standing when the shots started, but heard a “barrage” of gunfire at the side of the building.
Hankison’s testimony will continue in federal court on Monday.",N
Spanish far-right politician shot in the face suspects a link to his work with Iranian opposition,2023-11-09,2023-11-10T05:51:56Z,en,seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/veteran-spanish-conservative-politician-shot-in-face-in-madrid-street/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110055156id_/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/veteran-spanish-conservative-politician-shot-in-face-in-madrid-street/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110055156/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/veteran-spanish-conservative-politician-shot-in-face-in-madrid-street/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcykvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL3ZldGVyYW4tc3BhbmlzaC1jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUtcG9saXRpY2lhbi1zaG90LWluLWZhY2UtaW4tbWFkcmlkLXN0cmVldD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cnNzX2FsbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9cnNz,"MADRID (AP) â Spanish right-wing politician Alejandro Vidal-Quadras was recovering in a hospital Thursday after being shot in the face in broad daylight on a central Madrid street. Police were ruling out no hypotheses, including a possible link to the former European lawmakerâs ties with the Iranian opposition.
A police source close to the investigation told The Associated Press there was no evidence backing the Iranian link, but confirmed that Vidal-Quadras himself had raised that suspicion from his hospital bed and that investigators were looking into it as one of several possible motives.
In a sign that police were broadening the investigation to look into the Iranian angle, another official revealed that a provincial brigade that handles terrorism and extremism cases joined late on Thursday in the inquiries previously led by agents specialized in homicides.
Both officials spoke to AP under the condition of anonymity to protect the secrecy of the inquiries.
Vidal-Quadras, 78, was attacked at around 1:30 p.m. near his home in the Spanish capital and he was conscious when taken to a hospital by emergency crews.
There were no immediate arrests and police were checking on surveillance footage and witness accounts to identify the shooter, who had been seen wearing a black helmet. The suspect had fired one gunshot before fleeing on a motorbike driven by an accomplice.
A charred motorbike found later in the day in a suburban town on the outskirts of Madrid was being investigated, one of the officials said.
Four hours after the shooting, Madridâs Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n hospital said the gunshot had fractured Vidal Quadrasâ jawbone and that he would undergo surgery. It said the politician was in stable condition and his life was not in danger.
Vidal-Quadras was a member of Spainâs conservative Popular Party, its regional leader in Catalonia, and a European Parliament member before leaving after three decades when he fell out with then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.
After he broke away, he helped found the far-right Vox party. He left Vox shortly after a failed attempt to win a European lawmaker seat in 2014.
As part of his political career, Vidal-Quadras has been aligned for decades with the Iranian opposition in exile, an involvement that was noticed by Tehran.
In January, the Iranian Foreign Ministry announced it imposed sanctions on Vidal-Quadras along with others who had ties with the exiled opposition group known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, accusing them of âsupporting terrorism and terrorist groups.â
The group, known as the MEK, began as a Marxist organization opposing the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. It claimed â and was suspected of â a series of attacks against U.S. officials in Iran in the 1970s, something the group now denies.
The MEK operates under a variety of names, including the National Council of Resistance of Iran and the Peopleâs Mujahedeen Organization of Iran.
In mid-September, addressing a conference organized by the NCRI in Brussels, Vidal-Quadras criticized European Union officials and leaders for not being strong enough in their opposition to Iran and in their support for the exiled opposition.
The MEK also has paid former American and European officials to speak at their summits in the past.
Iranâs state-run media in the past, citing reporting by the Spanish daily newspaper El PaÃs, had alleged Vidal-Quadrasâ Vox party had received MEK money. It described the payments as âterrorist money.â
âThe Iranian Resistance sees Iran’s ruling religious fascism as the first suspect accused in this case, as Prof. Vidal-Quadras has dedicated an important part of his life to fight against it,â MEK leader Maryam Rajavi wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Reactions over the unusual shooting on a street in broad daylight poured in, with many politicians and commentators expressing surprise.
âThank God it seems that Alejandro Vidal-Quadras is out of danger,â Vox President Santiago Abascal said.
Popular Party President Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o denounced the shooting and wished for Vidal-Quadras’ recovery. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez also expressed his concern.
âAll my warmth at this moment (is) for him and his family,â SÃ¡nchez said on X.
Vidal-Quadras was a vice president for the European Parliament and took a heavy interest in foreign affairs, participating in the legislatureâs delegations to the former Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.
He has not been active in politics for several years but has maintained a public role as a media commentator and columnist.

But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the departmentâs latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today.
Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life. They said the deadly police shooting has drawn attention to an issue they have been complaining about for years: that certain officers are known in the majority-Black community for harassing residents and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters.
âTheyâre always jumping out on us for no reason. It happens all the time,â said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. âNow, we see the consequences.â
McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots.
Officials said officers on a District Action Team â squads focused on seizing illegal guns â were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the cityâs most violent neighborhoods.
In the immediate aftermath of Tuesdayâs shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officersâ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon.
âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said at the scene Tuesday. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months.
Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the cityâs Black community.
After Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms.
Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders.
Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Universityâs Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach.
âThe focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,â he said. âCommunities donât want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.â
A study published by Websterâs team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but thereâs âa ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrustâ â partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence.
Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimoreâs low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era.
âThe name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,â researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers âfocus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.â She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the departmentâs internal discipline process.
âDue to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,â Eldridge said. âThese teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.â
Less than six months before Tuesdayâs shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying âcharacteristics of an armed person.â The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind.
McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them.
âThey look at everybody as suspects unless youâre old or a certain color,â Rashawn McNeil said. âItâs dehumanizing. Thatâs what it is.â",N

Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki told Parliament’s Departmental Committee on Administration and Internal Security that “unless all resources are mobilized and availed, our troops will not leave the country.”
He said U.N. member states are securing resources and have identified how funds will be mobilized and made available to Kenya for the mission. However, it was not immediately clear when the forces would be fully trained and funded to allow for deployment.
Meanwhile, Haiti is reporting a fresh round of gang-related killings and kidnappings as it awaits help.
On Wednesday, Haiti’s Superior Court of Auditors and Administrative Disputes said five of its employees were kidnapped in the capital, Port-au-Prince, forcing the agency to temporarily postpone all hearings.
“The court hopes that the civil servants, who do not receive a salary that allows them to meet the financial demands of the kidnappers, will be quickly released,” it said in a statement.
Also this week, the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration said that nearly 2,500 people in the coastal town of Mariani located west of the capital were displaced by violence as gangs inltrate previously peaceful communities.
Nearly 200,000 Haitians have now lost their homes to gangs who pillage neighborhoods operated by rivals in their quest to control more territory. Many of the displaced are now sleeping outside or in makeshift settlements that are crowded and extremely unsanitary.
“In a country where security is not a priority for the government, each time you go out, you don’t know if you’re going to be shot at,” said Mario Volcy, a 40-year-old construction worker as he waited for a bus in Port-au-Prince. “These guys have machine guns in their hands. They could surprise you by doing something crazy and dumb.”
Volcy travels from his hometown of Les Cayes, west of Port-au-Prince, to the capital on public transportation amid fears that he could be killed or kidnapped. He said bus fares have spiked because drivers now must pay gangs a “toll” for safe passage.
More than 1,230 killings and 701 kidnappings were reported across Haiti from July 1 to Sept. 30, more than double the figure reported during the same period last year, according to the U.N.
Gangs continue to overwhelm Haiti’s National Police, which remains understaffed and underfunded despite the international community supplying training and resources. In late October, two more police officers were killed, according to a police union, with a total of 32 officers slain so far this year.
Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry first requested the immediate deployment of foreign armed forces more than a year ago, but it wasn’t until early October that the U.N. Security Council voted to send a non-U.N. multinational force to Haiti that would be funded by voluntary contributions.
But even if the Kenyan forces arrive, it won’t change much, said Pierre Espérance, executive director of the Haitian National Human Rights Defense Network.
“The biggest problem right now in Haiti is the absence of the government and rule of law, and also all key state institutions have collapsed, even the police,” he said. “How will the force be able to operate in Haiti if we don’t have a functional government?”
Espérance also noted Haiti’s government has long been linked to gangs, compounding the problem.
A spokesperson for the prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It’s not clear when exactly Kenya’s police would be deployed. In addition to waiting for training and funding, Kenya’s government is awaiting resolution of a local court case blocking the deployment.
A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition filed by former presidential candidate, Ekuru Aukot, who argued the deployment is unconstitutional. However, the case was pushed back for the second time in less than a month because the judge is attending a training.
The case is now scheduled to be heard on Nov. 16.
Kenya’s Parliament also has to approve of the deployment.
The country’s National Security Council petitioned Parliament on Oct. 25 to approve the deployment. The petition is currently with the Departmental Committee on Administration and Internal Security. It will be presented to the House later this month.

The suspect, a teenager, was detained as part of a large-scale police operation earlier in the day in the town of Offenburg.
He had allegedly entered a classroom at the high school for children with special needs, and fired at least one shot from a handgun at a classmate, police said.
The other student was first treated by emergency services and then taken to a hospital where he later died of his injuries, dpa reported.
“The police are on site with strong forces,” local authorities said in a statement. “There is no further danger.”
Police said it appeared that there was only one suspect and one victim.
The motive for the attack is likely to be personal, dpa reported.
The school was initially cordoned off and students were asked to stay in their classrooms for their safety, dpa reported. Later Thursday, around 180 students were led out of the school to another location where they were being counseled by special staff. After that, they would be able to return to their parents, dpa reported.
No further details were immediately available on the suspect, the victim or the weapon.
School shootings are unusual in Germany. However, the country has seen some shootings at schools over the years. In March 2009, a 17-year-old student killed 15 people and then himself in the town of Winnenden.",N

(AP) — The ex-Louisville police officer on trial for firing into Breonna Taylor’s apartment the night she was killed testified Thursday he had to react quickly after a fellow officer was shot in the leg during the drug raid.
Brett Hankison said he saw a muzzle flash come from inside Taylor’s hallway after officers knocked down the door in the early hours of March 13, 2020, to execute a search warrant. He testified he believed it sounded like an assault rifle, so he moved to the side of Taylor’s apartment and fired shots in through a sliding glass door and window.
“I had to react,” Hankison said on the witness stand in U.S. District Court Thursday. “I had no choice.”
Taylor’s boyfriend had fired a single shot at officers after they came through the door, and two officers at the entry returned fire, striking and killing Taylor in the hallway of her apartment.
While no one was hit by the 10 shots he fired, prosecutors have argued Hankison was shooting erratically without identifying a target. Some of his gunshots went into an occupied neighboring apartment.
Hankison said he moved away from the entry door, rounded the corner of the apartment and sprayed bullets into the side windows and sliding glass door because he believed a shooter was advancing on officers in the doorway. He said he believed the officers “were taking automatic gunfire and were trapped.” The officers at the door fired a combined 22 shots after Taylor’s boyfriend fired a single round.
“It sounded like he was walking up on us … like he was executing” the other officers, Hankison said.
Hankison, 47, has been charged with two federal civil rights violations for endangering Taylor, her boyfriend and Taylor’s neighbors, who shared a wall with her apartment. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Federal prosecutors are attempting to do what Kentucky prosecutors couldn’t — convict Hankison for his actions on the night Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death. He was acquitted by a jury last year of wanton endangerment charges.
Prosecutors at this trial have argued Hankison did not follow police use of force policies when he decided to fire through Taylor’s windows and sliding door. When his attorney asked him about that, he said he “didn’t have time to think about a policy.”
“You’re acting to save lives, or not acting and people are going to die,” Hankison said.
Hankison said he feels “horrible” about Taylor’s death and that it was “tragic for a lot of people and a lot of families.” Her death along with George Floyd’s at the hands of Minneapolis police officers sparked weeks of protests over police brutality in the summer of 2020.
Hankison was also critical of the warrant, saying he and the other officers should have never been sent to her apartment that night. The Taylor warrant was one of five served simultaneously the night she was killed, part of a wide-ranging narcotics operation targeting a known drug dealer. The dealer was located in another part of town but had a previous relationship with Taylor.
Three other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant have been charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany in their trial next year.
The former Louisville officer shot by Taylor’s boyfriend during the raid, Jonathan Mattingly, also testified Thursday, saying he was standing in front of the door when it opened and saw a muzzle flash in the dark. He said he saw two figures at the end of the hallway before he was shot.
Mattingly, who retired from the police force in 2021, said he couldn’t tell where Hankison was standing when the shots started, but heard a “barrage” of gunfire at the side of the building.
Hankison’s testimony will continue in federal court on Monday.",N

Biden also told reporters he had asked the Israelis for a “pause longer than three days” during negotiations over the release of some hostages held by Hamas, although he ruled out the chances of a general cease-fire.
In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron has opened a Gaza aid conference with an appeal for Israel to protect civilians, saying that “all lives have equal worth” and that fighting terrorism “can never be carried out without rules.”
The war, now in its second month, was triggered by the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel.
The number of Palestinians killed in the war has risen to over 10,800, including more than 4,400 children, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza said.
In the occupied West Bank, more than 160 Palestinians have been killed in the violence and Israeli raids. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, most of them in the Hamas attack, and about 240 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza by the militant group.

Here’s what is happening in the latest Israel-Hamas war:
NETANYAHU SAYS ISRAEL DOES NOT INTEND TO OCCUPY OR GOVERN GAZA AFTER THE WAR
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war in Gaza will continue until Hamas is defeated but asserted that the country has no intention to conquer or govern the blockaded territory after the fighting ends.
In an interview with Fox News that aired Thursday evening, Netanyahu made clear that though Israel had no intention of occupying Gaza, it did envision a radically reshaped territory free of Hamas.
“What we have to see is Gaza demilitarized, deradicalized and rebuilt,” he said.
Netanyahu was also asked about the prospect of a daily humanitarian pause. He replied, “the fighting continues against the Hamas enemy, the Hamas terrorists, but in specific locations for a given period, a few hours here, a few hours there, we want to facilitate a safe passage of civilians away from the zone of fighting. And we’re doing that.”
PRO-PALESTINIAN DEMONSTRATORS OCCUPY NEW YORK TIMES LOBBY, ACCUSE MEDIA OF PRO-ISRAEL BIAS
NEW YORK – Pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied the lobby of The New York Times on Thursday, accusing the media of betraying a bias toward Israel in its coverage of the war and demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.
Hundreds of protesters led by a group of media workers calling themselves “Writers Bloc” gathered outside the publication’s Manhattan headquarters, with many of them entering the building’s atrium for a sit-in and vigil that lasted more than an hour.
It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was arrested during the sit-in. An email sent to New York Times staffers obtained by The Associated Press described the protest as “peaceful.”
The sit-in followed a series of actions at high-profile locations in New York, including the Statue of Liberty and Grand Central Terminal, intended to bring attention to the growing death toll in Gaza.
PALESTINIAN ECONOMY SLAMMED BY WAR, UN SAYS, AND NEARLY HALF OF GAZA’S HOUSING IS DAMAGED
A U.N. report paints a stark picture of the collapsing Palestinian economy after a month of war and Israel’s near total siege of Gaza.
The gross domestic product shrank 4% in the West Bank and Gaza in the war’s first month, sending over 400,000 people into poverty — an economic impact unseen in the conflicts Syria and Ukraine, or any previous Israel-Hamas war.
At least 45% of all housing in the Gaza strip has also been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardment, according to the assessment released Thursday by the U.N. Development Program and the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for West Asia.
If the war continues for a second month, the U.N. projects that the Palestinian gross domestic product, which was $20.4 billion before the war, will drop by 8.4%. That’s a loss of $1.7 billion. And if the conflict lasts a third month, Palestinian GDP will drop by 12%, with losses of $2.5 billion and more than 660,000 people pushed into poverty.
UNDP Assistant Secretary-General Abdallah Al Dardari said a 12% GDP loss at the end of the year would be “massive and unprecedented.” By comparison, he said, the Syrian economy used to lose 1% of its GDP per month at the height of the conflict which began in 2011, and it took Ukraine 18 months of fighting to lose 30% of its GDP.
ISRAEL USES ITS ARROW-3 MISSILE INTERCEPTOR FOR FIRST TIME
JERUSALEM — Israel said it used one of its most advanced air and missile defense systems for the first time Thursday to intercept a missile launched toward Israel in the Red Sea region.
The system, known as the Arrow 3, is designed to intercept long-range missiles outside the atmosphere, according to a joint statement from Israel’s military and Ministry of Defense.
Thursday marks the Arrow 3 system’s first missile interception since it was deployed in 2017. Last week, the Arrow 2 system was used to intercept a missile for the first time, the statement said.
The Arrow 3 system was co-developed and co-produced by the Israel Missile Defense Organization in the Israel Ministry of Defense and the United States Missile Defense Agency, led by Israel Aerospace Industries. It is one of the most advanced air and missile defense systems of its kind in the world for intercepting long-range ballistic missiles.
US TROOPS IN SYRIA AND IRAQ ATTACKED SEVERAL TIMES IN PAST DAY, OFFICIAL SAYS
WASHINGTON — U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria have been targeted multiple times in the last day, with three minor injuries reported, U.S. defense officials said Thursday.
The attacks took place as the U.S. conducted another airstrike against an Iranian weapons storage area Wednesday to try to convince Iranian-backed militant groups to cease the hostilities and avoid spurring a larger conflict
Within the past day, militants have launched two separate attacks using multiple rockets against U.S. and coalition forces operating at Green Village, Syria; a one-way drone attack was launched against U.S. and Coalition forces at Mission Support Site Euphrates, Syria; U.S. and coalition convoy encountered a roadside bomb near the Mosul Dam, in Iraq; and a one-way attack drone was launched at U.S. and coalition forces at the al Asad air base in Iraq.
There were three minor injuries reported in the Green Village attacks but all personnel returned to duty.
No other injuries or damage was reported in the strikes, according to defense officials who provided details of the attacks on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public.
According to deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh, U.S. and coalition forces have been attacked 46 times since Oct. 17, injuring 56 personnel. All have returned to duty, Singh said.

US LAWMAKER OFFERS GLIMPSE INTO EFFORTS TO FREE HOSTAGES
WASHINGTON — Part of the deal under discussion for the hoped-for freeing of an estimated 240 people held by Hamas involves a pause in fighting in exchange for the release of some hostages, Sen. Ben Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Associated Press in an interview Thursday.
Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, returned this week after helping lead a congressional delegation to the Middle East on the Israel-Hamas war, and after meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House Wednesday night on issues including efforts to free the hostages.
But there were numerous demands to be resolved in the negotiations, including whether the longer pause in fighting or the hostage release would come first, and whether it would be possible to access all the hostages to know how many there were and the state of their health, Cardin said.
Similar “good-faith discussions” have been taking place through intermediary countries since early in the crisis, “and we have been told in the last several weeks that progress is imminent … and then nothing happens,” he said. “So I think we’re in a similar position.”
EXLOSION HITS ISRAELI RED SEA CITY, AND YEMEN’S HOUTHI REBELS TAKE CREDIT
Israel’s military said a drone exploded Thursday in the yard of a house in the Red Sea city of Eilat, causing no injuries, and a long-range surface-to-surface missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace.
Later, Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they fired a batch of ballistic missiles at Israeli targets, some of which were heading for Eilat, acording to Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sare’e.
Thursday’s round of missile fire is one of at least five ariel attacks the Houthis have launched against southern Israel since Oct. 7. The Iran-backed force, who control Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, are staunch enemies of Israel and have vowed to continue their military operations in support of Palestinians.
NO WAY FOR AID TO REACH CIVILIANS IN NORTH GAZA, US OFFICIAL SAYS
WASHINGTON — The U.S. humanitarian envoy for the war described improving aid delivery for central and southern Gaza, but described no such effort in the northern battle zone other than to help civilians flee the intensifying Israeli assault there.
Envoy David Satterfield said Thursday that the international community had been able to get fuel to turn back on water desalination plants in the south, and that aid into the south was averaging 100 trucks a day. Two pipelines supplying clean drinking water to the south from Israel had been turned back on.
“We do see the ability in the coming days we hope to meet the minimum requirements of the population in the south,” he said.
Satterfield also said in the online briefing that agreements being worked out would include a way to move wounded from the north.
The U.N. estimated on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of people were still in northern Gaza, but could not immediately provide an updated figure.
13 PALESTINIANS KILLED IN WEST BANK RAID, HAMAS SAYS 9 WERE ITS FIGHTERS
JERUSALEM — An hourslong Israeli raid into the West Bank’s flashpoint Jenin refugee camp Thursday killed 13 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials.
The Israeli army said it killed at least 10 militants. Hamas claimed nine of those killed in the raid as their militant fighters. The attack included a drone strike — a once rare attack mode in the West Bank that has grown increasingly commonplace since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said that one of their paramedics, Sabreen Obeidi, had been shot in the back and wounded by Israeli forces targeting an ambulance. The group posted a picture to the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, of an ambulance with a single bullet hole.
The medical charity Doctors Without Borders said its team members treated a paramedic who was shot inside an ambulance at 10:30 a.m. local time. Since 11 a.m., Israeli military vehicles blocked ambulances from entering their hospitals, forcing teams to send patients to hospitals further away.
Team members said they witnessed Israeli forces fire at the entrance of the hospital, with bullets hitting the wall directly above the door.
“Hospitals are not targets and must remain safe spaces,” the organization said in a statement.
Israeli forces said they arrested over 20 Palestinians, confiscated weapons and ammunition, and destroyed an underground tunnel. Two militants were killed in a shootout as soldiers left the area, the military said.
Residents said raid unfolded in two stages. Around 1 a.m., residents said Israeli forces stormed the city, using bulldozers to rip up roads. At 10 a.m., forces entered again, firing at various locations with drones.
CIA CHIEF IS IN QATAR WORKING TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIAL SAYS
WASHINGTON – CIA Director William Burns was in Doha on Thursday to discuss efforts to win the release of hostages in Gaza with the Qatari prime minister and the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, according to a U.S. official.
Burns met with Mossad chief David Barnea and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The Hamas militant group that rules Gaza is holding what officials estimate to be some 240 hostages seized in Hamas’s deadly Oct. 7 incursion into Israel. International officials are believed to be pursuing a deal in which Hamas could free some hostages in exchange for a pause in Israel’s air, ground and sea assault on Gaza.
Qatar is a frequent go-between in international dealings with Hamas, and some top Hamas political leaders make their home in the Gulf country.
The U.S. official stressed Burns was not playing a lead role in the negotiations.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS ISRAEL AGREES TO 4-HOUR DAILY PAUSES IN NORTHERN GAZA FIGHTING TO ALLOW CIVILIANS TO FLEE
The White House says Israel has agreed to put in place daily four-hour humanitarian pauses in its assault on Hamas in northern Gaza. The Biden administration says it has secured a second pathway for civilians to flee fighting.
President Joe Biden had asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to institute the daily pauses during a Monday call.
U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the first humanitarian pause would be announced Thursday, and that the Israelis had committed to announcing each four-hour window at least three hours in advance. Biden says he asked the Israelis for a “pause longer than three days” during negotiations over the release of some hostages held by Hamas.
PALESTINIAN HEALTH MINISTRY SAYS NEARLY 11,000 KILLED IN GAZA
The Palestinian Health Ministry says the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza has risen to 10,818.
In its latest update Thursday, the ministry said the figure includes 4,412 children and 2,198 women. The vast majority have been killed in Israeli airstrikes that have pounded the enclave following Hamas’ assault on Israel.
An additional 26,905 Palestinians in Gaza have been injured.
GERMANY’S FOREIGN MINISTER BACK IN THE MIDDLE EAST
BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Baerbock is traveling to the Middle East for the third time in a month with stop-overs planned in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Germany’s foreign ministry said Thursday Baerbock’s meetings will focus on the release of the German hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, the humanitarian situation there, and efforts to prevent a regional conflagration of the conflict.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz has also traveled to Israel and other countries in the region since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Saudi Arabia has sent a cargo plane loaded with 35 tons of food and humanitarian aid to Egypt for delivery to the Gaza Strip.
The state-run Saudi Press Agency announced the first such aid shipment from the kingdom on Thursday.
Before the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, Saudi Arabia was in talks with the U.S. to normalize relations with Israel in return for an American defense pact, aid in setting up a civilian nuclear program and major progress toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Saudi Arabia has condemned the violence and called for a cease-fire.
Several countries have flown aid for Gaza to El-Arish, in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, which borders Gaza and Israel. Under a diplomatic arrangement, the aid is shipped overland through Egypt’s Rafah crossing with Gaza after being inspected inside Israel.
Aid workers say the hundreds of trucks allowed into Gaza in recent weeks are nowhere near enough to meet the mounting needs of the territory’s 2.3 million Palestinians.
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CAUTIONS ABOUT INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN GAZA
The World Health Organization is cautioning about infectious diseases spreading in Gaza from contaminated water and limited access to hygiene facilities.
WHO reported Thursday that since mid-October 2023, over half of the 33,551 reported cases of diarrhea are among children under age five.
The organization said that’s a significant increase compared to an average of 2,000 cases monthly in children under five throughout 2021 and 2022.
Also reported where 8,944 cases of scabies and lice, 1,005 cases of chickenpox, 12,635 cases of skin rash and 54,866 cases of upper respiratory infections.
PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS SAY 7 KILLED IN ISRAELI RAID ON JENIN
Palestinian officials say an Israeli raid into the flashpoint city of Jenin in the northern West Bank has killed seven Palestinians and injured 13.
Thursday’s raid was the latest in a series of stepped-up operations in the West Bank that Israel says it is staging to root out militancy in the territory.
The Israeli military described the raid as a “counterterrorism” operation.
Mustafa Sheta, the manager of a prominent cultural center in the Jenin refugee camp said residents feel “so helpless under this growing pressure, there is nothing we can do.”
The Palestinian Red Crescent said that one of its paramedics, Sabreen Obeidi, had been shot in the back by Israeli forces targeting an ambulance.
The group posted a picture to the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, of an ambulance with a single bullet hole. The armed wing of Fatah released a statement claiming that its forces were still engaging in gun battles with Israeli forces in Jenin.
MACRON URGES PROTECTION OF GAZA CIVILIANS
PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron is appealing for Israel to protect civilians in Gaza and is repeating calls for a humanitarian pause to allow aid to reach those who need it.
Macron told a Gaza aid conference in Paris on Thursday that “all lives have equal worth” and that fighting terrorism “can never be carried out without rules” while protecting civilians ”is non-negotiable.” b
He said that by attacking Israel on Oct. 7, Hamas “shouldered the responsibility for exposing Palestinians to terrible consequences,” and he again defended Israel’s right to defend itself.
Officials from Western and Arab nations, the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations are meeting in Paris with the aim of providing urgent aid to civilians in the Gaza Strip. Macron’s office said Israeli authorities aren’t participating.
More than 1.5 million people — or about 70% of Gaza’s population — have fled their homes, and an estimated $1.2 billion is needed to respond to the crisis in Palestinian areas.
DENMARK BOOSTS HUMANITARIAN AID TO GAZA
COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Denmark says it will increase its humanitarian aid to the civilian population in Gaza by 75 million kroner ($10.7 million).
The country’s Development Cooperation Minister Dan Jørgensen on Thursday called the situation “catastrophic and is worsening day by day.”
The aid will be channeled via U.N. agencies and the International Red Cross.
TURKEY’S PRESIDENT ACCUSES WEST OF “WEAKNESS”
ANKARA, Turkey – Turkey’s president is accusing Western nations of “weakness” in the face of civilian deaths in Gaza and called on Muslim nations to display unity against Israel’s actions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, made the comments Thursday at a meeting of the 10-member Economic Cooperation Organization in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
Erdogan said Western nations and organizations are observing these “massacres by Israel” from afar but are “too weak to even call for a cease-fire, let alone criticize child murderers.”
He added: “If we, the Economic Cooperation Organization, as Muslims, are not going to raise our voices today … when will we raise our voices?”
Erdogan also said Turkey would continue with its diplomatic efforts to implement a cease-fire and prevent the spread of the conflict.
The Economic Cooperation Organization regroups five Central Asian nations as well as Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
ISRAELI LABOR MINISTER SAYS NETANYAHU WILL HAVE TO CALL EARLY ELECTIONS
JERUSALEM — Israel’s labor minister says Benjamin Netanyahu will have to call early elections right after the war.
Labor Minister Yoav Bentzur made the unusually public suggestion in remarks quoted Thursday by the Maariv daily.
Bentzur from the ultraorthodox Shas party said Netanyahu ” will be forced to go to elections within 90 days, even before a commission of inquiry of some sort (into the war) is established.”
He added: “We can’t go on like this. The public will have its say, and then we will see if Netanyahu is given the mandate.”
Bentzur later tried to walk back the comments, saying they were taken out of context and don’t reflect the position of Shas, a close ally of Netanyahu.
Polls show Netanyahu’s support has dropped over Hamas’ shock attack, which killed more than 1,400 and left over 240 hostage, touching off a devastating Israeli war in the militants’ Gaza Strip stronghold.
PROMINENT LEADERS IN ISRAEL’S PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY ARRESTED
JERUSALEM – An advocacy group for Israel’s Arab citizens says six prominent leaders in Israel’s Palestinian community has been arrested in route to a protest against the military’s war in the Gaza Strip.
The detainees include Mohammed Barakeh, a former lawmaker and head of the High Follow-up Committee for Arab Citizens; and former lawmakers Hanin Zoabi and Sami Abou Shahadeh.
Police said in a statement that the protest in Nazareth was “liable to incite and harm the public’s welfare.” Police recently banned antiwar protests.
Adalah, the advocacy organization, said Barakeh was detained for questioning after he was followed by an unmarked police car. He had notified police on Wednesday that the committee planned to hold a protest with fewer than 50 people and therefore did not need a permit.
Adalah said Barakeh’s arrest was illegal and evidence of a policy “designed to muzzle any dissent and to suppress the freedom to protest of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel.”
SCORES WOUNDED AFTER OVERNIGHT ISRAELI SHELLING
The general director of Gaza City’s main hospital says scores of wounded people are being treated at the Al-Shifa Hospital following overnight Israeli strikes and shelling.
Dr. Mohammad Abu Selmia told the Associated Press by phone that at least one shell landed very close to the hospital at around dawn Thursday, resulting in only a few people sustaining minor injuries. He said it would’ve been a “catastrophe” had the shell landed any closer, adding that conditions at the hospital are “disastrous in every sense of the word.”
Abu Selmia said the hospital is in short supply of medicine and other medical equipment while doctors and nurses are exhausted, while staff is “unable to do much for the patients.”
He said the hospital has also been acting as makeshift shelter for some 60,000 displaced Palestinians.
A convoy of medical aid from the United Nations World Health Organization and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, reached al-Shifa Hospital Wednesday night. The heads of both agencies said in a joint statement that this the second convoy to reach the hospital since the onset of the Hamas-Israel war on Oct. 7. It did not include fuel, as Israel has banned it in its blockade of the Palestinian enclave.
“It would help us get by for another few hours, not days,” Abu Selmia said the aid was enough to help doctors get by “for another few hours, not days”, adding that a steady stream of such aid convoys are needed to mee the hospital’s needs.
NEGOTIATIONS UNDERWAY FOR 3-DAY HUMANITARIAN CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA
CAIRO — Negotiations are underway to reach a three-day humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza in exchange for the release of about a dozen hostages held by Hamas. That’s according to two officials from Egypt, one from the United Nations and a Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic efforts.
The deal would enable more aid, including limited amounts of fuel, to enter the besieged territory to alleviate worsening conditions for the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped there. It is being brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, according to the officials and the diplomat.
One of the Egyptian officials says details of the deal were discussed this week in Cairo with the visiting CIA chief and an Israeli delegation. The official said mediators are finalizing a draft deal.
A senior U.S. official said the Biden administration has not put forward any specific time frame for a pause in Israel’s military operations but has suggested that Israel consider tying the length of a pause to the release of a certain number of hostages.
If an agreement on the duration of the pause and the number of hostages to be freed can be reached and the deal successfully implemented, the same formula could be revisited for additional pauses and releases, according to the official.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said any temporary cease-fire would have to be accompanied by the release of the hostages who were seized by Hamas during the militant group’s Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel. Israel has said around 240 hostages, both Israelis and those with foreign passports, are currently held in Gaza.
A three-day cease-fire would allow the delivery of humanitarian aid across Gaza, including the northern area, the focus of Israel’s military campaign to crush the territory’s Hamas rulers. Under the proposed deal, some fuel would also enter Gaza for the first time since the start of the war, to be distributed to hospitals and bakeries under U.N. supervision.
Israel has barred fuel shipments to Gaza since the start of the war, arguing Hamas would divert them for military use. Over the past month, only limited amounts of aid, such as medicine, food and water, have entered Gaza. Aid workers say it’s not nearly enough to meet mounting needs.
Under the proposed truce deal, Hamas would release a dozen civilian hostages, most of them foreign passport holders, and provide a complete list of hostages to mediators, according to the officials. The International Committee of the Red Cross would be allowed to visit the hostages.
The diplomat said the talks are complex because of the involvement of different parties in the region and in Western capitals.

By all accounts, F.L. “Bubba” Copeland Jr. was loved by thousands in Smiths Station, a community of about 5,400. He was mayor. He was a small-business owner. He was a pastor. And yet when he was dealing with fallout from his community believing he was queer, he decided to kill himself.
A conservative publication had posted pictures of Copeland wearing a wig and women’s clothing. He addressed the issue from the pulpit on Nov. 1, saying the article did not reflect who he was and that “sometimes people stumble” in their faith walk.
On Nov. 3, after days of public ridicule, police said, Copeland shot himself in front of them. Former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones criticized the publication for outing Copeland, posting on social media “we live in a mean and bitter world where the self-righteous tend to throw the largest stones.”
I had not heard of Copeland prior to his death, but I do empathize with much of his story.
I was closeted while working in the ministry for years. At one point in life, I too concluded that suicide was my only choice. I was blessed to have survived my attempt. For far too many, that is not the case. This is why organizations such as the Trevor Project and the Ali Forney Center are needed â to provide refuge and help for those struggling with sexual orientation and gender identity. It’s gut-wrenching to know someone as cared for in his community as Copeland was still did not believe that same community would love him if they believed he was queer.
For his final sermon, Copeland turned to the Book of Psalms and its many passages about life’s challenges and God’s protection.
“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil,” he said at his church’s Wednesday evening service last week. “For you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
“When you’re down, scared, worried, remember who has you. Whose rod, whose staff guides you, who takes care of you. The only opinion that matters is what’s God’s opinion of you.”
And then two days later he killed himself.
He was 49. His funeral is set for Thursday. His death is a reminder that you never know what people are privately dealing with, especially in places of worship, where heartache comes to find healing.
We can’t ask Bubba Copeland what was going through his mind. But we do know what’s been going on in this nation: a disturbing wave of hatred and violence toward LGBTQ+ people.
In July in New York, a gay man was killed for dancing. Outside of Los Angeles, a straight woman was killed the next month for hanging a rainbow flag. This week, a man in Dallas was sentenced to 48 years in prison for murdering a trans woman in 2019 just weeks after she had been beaten by a group of other men. And now the mayor of a small town in the Bible Belt takes his own life. Senseless homophobic and transphobic violence across the country, hurting Americans from very different walks of life, sometimes people who aren’t even LGBTQ+.
Jars of Clay, one of my favorite Christian bands, has a song called “Shelter,” which is rooted in the communal spirit of Psalms. The lyrics are a reminder to be kind: “God has given us each other, and we will never walk alone.” When asked about it, lead singer Dan Haseltine said: “There is no power in love, no gravity in forgiveness, no consuming light in darkness, no incomprehensibility of joy if we forget we belong to each other.”
A recent political poll found 76% of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. I happen to be one of them. We are headed in the wrong direction: apart from one another.
Whether through legislation or rhetoric, we just keep finding ways to push each other away. To “other” one another. To hurt one another.
This is particularly harmful when it comes to faith communities and places of worship, where we are supposed to gather and find fellowship. If faith leaders are wondering why America’s church attendance is at a historic low, I would start there.
A small town in east Alabama is saying goodbye to someone it shouldn’t have lost. The hope is that some other person struggling with similar issues will find the reassurance and love to know they are not walking alone. That instead of ridicule and shame, there is shelter.

“Her body might not be here but her spirit lives in her legacy here, and I’m going to keep my baby’s name alive,” Stephanie Houston, the mother of Muhlaysia Booker, said in her victim impact statement in court.
Kendrell Lyles, 37, pleaded guilty to murder Monday as jury selection was set to begin, and was sentenced to 48 years in prison. Authorities haven’t revealed Lyles’ motive for killing Booker, and Lyles’ attorney has said he doesn’t know why he did it.
About a month before Booker was killed, she was beaten by several men in an unrelated attack as a crowd gathered after a minor traffic accident. The attack was caught on cellphone video and shared widely on social media. Booker, who was hospitalized, told police that the people who attacked her used homophobic slurs.
The violence that befell Booker in her short life exemplifies threats faced by transgender people, and especially Black transgender women, across the U.S. She was shaken but resolute when she spoke at a rally held after the attack, telling supporters: “This time, I can stand before you, whereas in other scenarios, we are at a memorial.”
Booker’s friend, Jordan Ford, said in court Thursday that the assault didn’t break her spirit, instead it inspired her to speak out.
“Muhlaysia took it upon herself to raise awareness about the hate and violence that transgender individuals face every day,” Ford said. “She refused to be silenced by adversity and her unwavering determination inspired many.”
Ford said Booker not only took the time to mentor younger LGBTQ+ people but also would go live on social media to let them know “it’s OK to be true to who you are.”
Booker’s body was found the morning of May 18, 2019, on a Dallas street. Police said they identified Lyles as the suspect while investigating the deaths of a man and woman who were killed in separate shootings in the days after Booker’s slaying. Lyles was also charged in the deaths of those two victims, according to police. The other two victims were not transgender.
Booker got into a vehicle matching the description of one Lyles drove about three hours before her body was found, an arrest warrant said. A witness told investigators that Lyles frequented the area to meet with transgender sex workers, according to the warrant.
Houston told Lyles that she had warned her daughter about people like him.
“I warned my baby about the devil and that day she got in the car with the devil,” said Houston, adding that her daughter was shot three times and thrown out of the car “like she was trash.”
“You just looked at her like a transgender prostitute but she was more than that,” said Houston, who started the Muhlaysia Booker Foundation to support transgender people after her daughter’s death.
Texas is among states where transgender people have been targeted with a growing number of laws and policies, including restrictions on gender-affirming care, public bathroom use and participation in sports.
Since 2013, the Human Rights Campaign’s public education and research team has identified at least 334 transgender and gender-nonconforming people killed by violence across the U.S. Of those, 75% have been transgender women of color and almost 62% have been Black transgender women. And, HRC said, almost 10% of those killings happened in Texas — more than any other state.",N

(AP) â Two North Carolina sheriff’s deputies who were seriously wounded when they attempted to arrest a wanted man this week are expected to make a full recovery, authorities said Wednesday.
Robeson County sheriff’s deputies Jonathan Walters and Kaelin Locklear were injured by gunfire and a police vehicle on Tuesday as officers tried to serve a warrant on Shawn Tobin Locklear Jr., who is not related to the deputy.
The sheriff’s office said Shawn Locklear allegedly fired at the deputies and was shot several times before being taken into custody. He was in critical but stable condition at UNC Medical Center in Chapel Hill, a sheriffâs office news release said.
Sheriff Burnis Wilkins and his top lieutenants visited the two wounded deputies at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center in Fayetteville. Deputy Kaelin Locklear was listed in stable condition, while Walters was being treated in the intensive care unit, the statement said.
The sheriff’s office has said the 20-year-old suspect, who has been facing a murder charge since December and was released on bond in May, will face additional charges when he leaves the hospital, including two counts of attempted first-degree murder.
Wilkins said the shootings occurred Tuesday morning in a community outside of Maxton near the South Carolina line, with the suspect initially shooting at the deputies, who then returned fire.
The sheriff said the suspect fled the area by getting into one of the wounded deputiesâ cruisers and backing up, running over Walters’ leg. He was later arrested by other deputies.
Wilkins said deputies had originally sought Shawn Locklear on suspicion of violating the conditions of his pretrial release because the monitoring bracelet around his ankle had been removed.
Wilkins on Tuesday said that he was â100% disgusted by certain parts of the judicial systemâ for how Shawn Locklear had been allowed out of jail while being accused of murder.
The Robeson sheriffâs office didnât immediately respond on Wednesday to a phone message or an email asking whether it had contact information on an attorney for the suspect.",N

The deputy director of the new White House office of gun violence prevention was looking for his starting point.
He set to work figuring out what grief and trauma resources were available for families of the victims and where the city could use assistance. He got a briefing from law enforcement. He met with the governor. And he started doling out help.
âMost governors and even city leaders see the federal government as a big machine â there’s so many different levers and processes and contacts,” Jackson said in an interview. âSo me just being a navigator and being able to help cut through some of the government jargon or get the proper contact within 15 minutes versus two days was huge.â
The Oct. 25 shootings at a bowling alley and nearby bar were the first test of the administration’s new office, set up in part to better coordinate federal help for a community dealing with the aftermath of gun violence.
âWe see this as a critical way to prevent future violence and disrupt the cycle of violence,” Jackson said. âThe first way we can prevent violence is to better serve those who have been directly impacted by violence.â
It’s something survivors and advocates have wanted for years. Gun violence continues to plague the nation despite the passage of gun safety legislation last year and a focus by President Joe Biden on ending gun violence.
The issue also figures heavily into Biden’s 2024 reelection campaign, which hopes to reach younger voters who are deeply concerned about gun violence. The president has also pushed for a ban on assault weapons.
âThis is about common sense,â Biden said last week during a trip to Lewiston. âReasonable, responsible measures to protect our children, our families, our communities. Because regardless of our politics, this is about protecting our freedom to go to a bowling alley, a restaurant, a school, church, without being shot and killed.â
Biden has called gun violence âthe ultimate superstorm,â affecting not just victims but the everyday lives of community members. His administration believes the response should better resemble how the government acts after natural disasters.
As of Wednesday, there had been at least 37 mass killings in the United States in 2023, leaving at least 195 people dead, not including shooters who died, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.
But the White House office isn’t intended to help manage only the aftermath of mass killings.
Some 21% of U.S. adults have reported a personal tie to gun violence, such as being threatened by a gun or being a victim of a shooting, according to a 2022 poll by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Jackson, like many others working in gun violence prevention, has firsthand experience. He was shot about 10 years ago walking down the street in Washington His 19-year-old cousin was shot and killed about a decade earlier. He was on the ground in Buffalo, New York, as a volunteer last year helping manage the fallout after a white supremacist killed 10 Black people at a supermarket.
âIâve watched a community suffer alone, and how devastating that can be,” he said.
Until now, Jackson said, the only unified response coming from the federal government was via law enforcement. That was helpful, but it did not address businesses losing money because they had to close as police investigated nearby or schools that reopened without enough trauma therapists for students.
âThere was a crime response,â he said. âBut when you look beyond the law enforcement response, those levers were never pulled in a systematic way until this office was created.â
In Lewiston, late last month, eight people died at a bar, seven more at the nearby bowling alley and three others at hospitals. An additional 13 people were injured in the shootings. Gunman Robert Card, a 40-year-old firearms instructor, was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
The White House office was established roughly five weeks before the shooting. In that time, Jackson had already set up contacts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the FBI’s victim assistance center, the Small Business Administration and other federal organizations. On the ground in Maine, he served as the primary federal contact, so local officials didn’t have to wade through a sea of federal agencies.
The office helped facilitate burial costs. It helped set up a âfamily and victim assistance centerâ at the local armory, a one-stop shop where people could come who were impacted by violence. Lewiston has a large deaf community, so sign language interpreters were stationed at the armory.
The White House offered Maine assistance in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, said Ben Goodman, a spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Janet Mills.
âThere is no question that these last few weeks have been difficult for everyone, but the governor is deeply grateful to the Biden administration for their unwavering support of Lewiston and Maine,â Goodman said.
The White House office has three main goals: better coordinate the federal response on the ground; fully implement gun safety legislation enacted in 2022 after a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two teachers were killed; look for ways to do more, whether through executive action, state steps or federal legislation.
“The president’s directive was really clear, to squeeze every benefit we possibly can out of this,” said Stefanie Feldman, a longtime policy adviser to Biden who is now leading the office.
The gun safety measure that Biden signed into law required enhanced background checks in all 50 states. But some states have privacy laws that prohibit the submission of information to the background check system, making the enhanced check significantly less useful. Feldman’s office has been working with state legislators and governor’s offices to make them aware of this issue and address it.
âA lot of that is behind the scenes,â she said.

(AP) â The owners of a Colorado funeral home were arrested Wednesday in Oklahoma on charges linked to the discovery of 190 sets of decaying remains at one of their facilities, including some that apparently had been languishing there for four years.
Investigators entered the Return to Nature Funeral Home building in the Rocky Mountain town of Penrose in early October to find âabhorrentâ conditions with dozens of stacked bodies, according to a federal affidavit thatâs under seal in Colorado but available in Oklahoma.
Some bodies had 2019 death dates, according to the document.
âLaw enforcement now knows the cremains each family was given could not have been their loved one,â reads the documents alleging funeral home owners Jon and Carie Hallford had fled Colorado to avoid prosecution.
The Hallfords were jailed on $2 million bond on a Colorado arrest warrant alleging approximately 190 counts of abuse of a corpse, five counts of theft, four counts of money laundering and over 50 counts of forgery â after their arrest in Wagoner, east of Tulsa. They’re set for an initial appearance on a federal fleeing charge on Nov. 9 in Muskogee.
They couldnât be reached for comment and didnât have attorneys listed in jail records. Neither has a listed personal phone number, and the funeral homeâs number no longer works.
During a news conference in Colorado Springs announcing the charges Wednesday, District Attorney Michael Allen said authorities wouldn’t be releasing many details in order to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation. He said the charging documents contain information that is âabsolutely shocking.”
Several families have told The Associated Press that the FBI told them privately that their loved ones were among the decaying bodies, meaning the ashes they were given weren’t their family members’. Those families were asked to give samples of the ashes they received to investigators to analyze.
Crystina Page is among the aggrieved relatives of the dead. She went to the news conference clutching a red urn with what Return to Nature told her were the ashes of her 20-year-old son, David, who was shot and killed by law enforcement in 2019. For four years, she carried the urn from the marble halls of the Colorado Capitol to Washington, D.C., as she advocated for police reform.
Her sonâs actual body was set to be cremated later Wednesday.
âFor four years, Iâve marched all over this country with this urn believing it to be my son,â Page said âMy son has been laying there rotting for four years. … Itâs the most horrendous feeling Iâve ever had in my life.â
Allen and others described an ongoing process of identifying the remains using fingerprints, dental records, medical hardware and, if necessary, DNA. They have identified 110 of the 190 sets of remains and have returned 25 to those people’s families.
The remains of Linda Martinez, 66, who died in 2020, were recently returned to relatives who originally thought they had interred her ashes in a cemetery.
âHow do you store almost 200 people?â wondered her grandson, Michael Martinez, of Colorado Springs. âAnd how do you even stomach that?â
Investigators are in contact with 137 families, and Allen asked for anyone who might have worked for or with the Hallfords or done business with the funeral home going back to September 2019 to come forward. He also asked relatives of the yet-unidentified dead to contact their late loved ones’ dentists for records that might help the investigation.
The Hallfords’ funeral home business is based in Colorado Springs and has a facility in Penrose, a small town about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Denver. Authorities found the remains Oct. 4 while responding to a report of an âabhorrent smellâ near the Penrose building.
Officials initially estimated there were about 115 bodies inside, but the number increased to 189 after they finished removing all the remains in mid-October. The total rose to 190 on Wednesday, though authorities didn’t explain the increase.
A day after the odor was reported, the director of the state office of Funeral Home and Crematory registration spoke by phone with Jon Hallford. He tried to conceal the improper storage of corpses at his business, acknowledged having a âproblemâ at the site and claimed he practiced taxidermy there, according to an order from state officials dated Oct. 5.
Relatives of people whose remains were handled by the funeral home have feared that their loved ones weren’t cremated and were instead among the remains that authorities found. They said death certificates indicated that the remains were cremated at one of two crematories, but both crematories told the AP that they weren’t performing cremations for Return to Nature at the time of the dates on the certificates.
âThis was intentional,” said Page, who started a private Facebook group for affected families. âAnd not only did they think about doing this, but they followed through with it, they concealed it and they did this to almost 200 families.â
As for the arrests, Page said, it âmakes it feel like thereâs an end in sight.â
Retired Army officer Tanya Wilson said her motherâs body was identified in the neglected remains found last month and believes the ashes Return to Nature had given her were fake. The bracelet left on the body of her mother, who sometimes three jobs to keep the family afloat, was returned to Wilsonâs family with a substance left on it.
âI donât think any amount of jail/prison time will justify my brother having to clean my motherâs rotting flesh off her bracelet that they gave back to us. Nothing,â Wilson said in a text to the AP.
The company, which was started in 2017 and offered cremations and âgreenâ burials without embalming fluids, kept doing business even as its financial and legal problems mounted in recent years. The owners had missed tax payments in recent months, were evicted from one of their properties and were sued for unpaid bills by a crematory that quit doing business with them almost a year ago, according to public records and interviews with people who worked with them.
Colorado has some of the weakest oversight of funeral homes in the nation with no routine inspections or qualification requirements for funeral home operators.
One family has filed a lawsuit accusing Return to Nature and the Hallfords of negligence, fraud, intentionally inflicting emotional distress and violating several Colorado laws, among other allegations.

(AP) â The Nashville district attorney called on Wednesday for the Tennessee legislature to make it easier to commit someone to a mental institution after a man who was previously released for incompetence to stand trial was accused of shooting an 18-year-old college student in the head.
Belmont University student Jillian Ludwig, of New Jersey, was walking on a track in a local park when she was shot and critically wounded at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to the Metro Nashville Police. They arrested Shaquille Taylor, 29, after surveillance video and witness statements pointed to him as the shooter. Video showed Ludwig falling after she was struck by a stray bullet as Taylor was firing at a car, according to a police affidavit.
A passerby discovered Ludwig on the ground at approximately 3:30 p.m. She was transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center where she was listed in extremely critical condition, police said.
Taylor is charged with aggravated assault and evidence tampering and was being held on a $280,000 bond. A public defender assigned to Taylorâs case did not return phone and email messages requesting comment.
Taylor has been charged criminally several times in the past. In 2021, Taylor was charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon after he and another man were accused of shooting at a female driver while her two children were in the back seat. At least two rounds struck the vehicle. Earlier this year, a Nashville judge dismissed those charges, and Taylor was released after court-appointed doctors testified that he was incompetent to stand trial. Federal and state law prohibit the prosecution of mentally incompetent defendants.
The May 19 court order explained that Taylor had developed pneumonia at birth, which led to a brain infection, and that he continues to function at a kindergarten level. Because Taylor also did not meet the criteria for involuntary commitment, the court had âreached the limit of its authority,â Criminal Court Judge Angelita Blackshear Dalton wrote.
Four months later, Taylor was arrested in a grocery store parking lot driving a Ford F-150 pickup truck that had been carjacked by two men wearing ski masks Sept. 16, police said. He was charged with felony auto theft and released on a $20,000 bond. A warrant was issued when he failed to appear in court Friday.
On Wednesday, Nashville District Attorney General Glenn Funk issued a statement criticizing the Tennessee law that sets out rules for when a person can be involuntarily committed, calling it a ânearly impossible standard.â State law requires at least two doctors to certify that the person is suffering from a severe mental illness or developmental disability that causes that person to be at a substantial risk of serious harm to himself or others. The doctors must also find that there are no less restrictive measures that could be taken.
âThe law must be altered to accurately balance individual needs with public safety,â Funk said in a statement. âAt the same time Tennessee must provide more beds and staffing resources to handle dangerous individuals.â
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell echoed those sentiments in a statement calling for âmore beds for individuals experiencing mental health crises and a renewed conversation about how we limit access to firearms for individuals we know are a threat to the community.â
Belmont University President Greg Jones sent an email to students and staff Wednesday morning announcing a prayer service for Ludwig. He described her as a music business major and bass player who âis often found at concerts, cheering on fellow musicians and using music as a way to connect with those around her.â She is also an avid runner who enjoys being outside, Jones wrote.",N

The pace appeared to be greater Wednesday, after the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said about 15,000 people fled Tuesday, compared to 5,000 on Monday and 2,000 on Sunday.
The densely populated northern area of Gaza, specifically Gaza City and adjacent crowded urban refugee camps, are the focus of Israel’s campaign to crush Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years. The war, now in its second month, was triggered by the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel.
The number of Palestinians killed in the war passed 10,500, including more than 4,300 children, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza said.
In the occupied West Bank, more than 160 Palestinians have been killed in the violence and Israeli raids. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, most of them in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that started the fighting, and 239 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza by the militant group.

US LAUNCHES STRIKE ON SITE IN SYRIA IN RESPONSE TO ATTACKS BY IRANIAN-BACKED MILITIAS
WASHINGTON — The U.S. launched an airstrike Wednesday on a facility in eastern Syria used by Iranian-backed militias, in retaliation to an increasing number of attacks over the past several weeks on bases housing U.S. troops, the Pentagon said.
Two U.S. F-15 fighter jets carried out the strike on a weapons storage facility linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.
President Joe Biden “directed today’s action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.
This is the second time in less than two weeks that the U.S. has bombed facilities used by the militant groups, many operating under the umbrella of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which U.S. officials say have carried out at least 40 such attacks in the region since Oct. 17.
UN RIGHTS CHIEF SAYS GAZA TURNED INTO A ‘LIVING NIGHTMARE’ BY ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR
GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief said collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians and their forced evacuation, as well as atrocities committed by Palestinian armed groups on Oct. 7 and their continued holding of hostages, amount to war crimes.
Volker Türk, standing in front of Egypt’s Rafah border crossing into Gaza, told reporters Wednesday: “These are the gates to a living nightmare.”
“We have fallen off a precipice. This cannot continue,” he said later in Cairo.
Türk said international human rights and humanitarian law must be respected to help protect civilians and allow desperately needed aid to reach Gaza’s beleaguered population of some 2.3 million people.
He said the U.N. rights office received reports in recent days about an unspecified orphanage in northern Gaza with 300 children who need urgent help, but communications were down and access were impassable and unsafe, so “we cannot get to them.”
“I feel, in my innermost being, the pain, the immense suffering of every person whose loved one has been killed in a kibbutz, in a Palestinian refugee camp, hiding in a building or as they were fleeing,” Türk said. “We all must feel this shared pain — and end this nightmare.”
GAZA HOSPITALS STRAIN UNDER ISRAELI SIEGE, WITH PREMATURE BIRTHS ON THE RISE
KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza City — Hospitals in Gaza are nearing collapse under Israel’s wartime siege, which has cut power and deliveries of food, fuel and other necessities to the territory.
Inside the maternity department at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, the workload has doubled because of the mass displacement from Gaza’s north. That’s according to neonatal specialist Dr. Asaad al-Nawajha, who said Wednesday his team has seen an increase in premature births as the monthlong war intensifies.
Shouq Hararah is one of those mothers. She says her delivery took place with “no proper birth procedures, no anesthesia, painkillers or anything.”
“I gave birth to twins. The boy was discharged, but the girl remains in the maternity ward,” she said.
Standing before a row of beeping incubators, al-Nawajha emphasized the war’s life-threatening consequences.
“All of our work depends on electricity; all the machines you see here rely on it,” the doctor said. “When the electricity is cut, these devices stop working, and all the babies will face certain death.”
SYRIA SAYS ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES HIT MILITARY POSITIONS
Israel airstrikes hit several Syrian military positions late Wednesday, Syrian state media reported.
Quoting an unnamed military source, state news agency SANA said the strikes caused material damage, and did not mention any casualties nor the locations where the airstrikes took place. Pro-government radio station Sham FM said the sounds of explosions could be heard in southeast Sweida province and in some suburbs of the capital, Damascus.
Meanwhile, Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strike in Sweida province targeted an air defense and radar unit, while at least three strikes in suburbs near Damascus were not far from Syria’s military airbase and wounded three people, without giving further details.
Israel, which has vowed to stop Iranian entrenchment next door, has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets in government-controlled parts of neighboring Syria in recent years, but it rarely acknowledges them. Israel did not immediately comment on the alleged airstrikes.
93 ROMANIANS WHO ESCAPED GAZA FLY TO BUCHAREST
BUCHAREST, Romania — A group of 93 Romanian citizens landed Wednesday evening at an airbase near Romania’s capital on a flight from Egypt after being evacuated from the Gaza Strip.
The specially chartered flight touched down at Base 90 at Bucharest’s Otopeni Airport around 10.00 p.m. local time. The plane also brought back 36 Moldovan citizens, according to Romania’s foreign ministry.
Romania’s Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu had flown to Egypt earlier on Wednesday to meet the evacuees and returned with them on the flight to Romania.
“I was overwhelmed to see the joy and hope in the eyes of the children who escaped the hell in Gaza,” Ciolacu wrote on Facebook after arriving in Egypt. “The Romanian Government will continue to act to facilitate the evacuations by all the means at our disposal.”
Another 51 Romanians have also been granted permission to leave Gaza into Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, the foreign ministry said, but did not specify when.
Six Romanians who hold dual Romanian-Israeli citizenship are among the hostages held by Hamas. Since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, at least five Romanian citizens have been confirmed killed.
BRAZIL STOPS TERROR PLOT AGAINST JEWISH COMMUNITY, OFFICIAL SAYS
RIO DE JANEIRO — Authorities in Brazil foiled a terror plot on Wednesday when they arrested two people in Sao Paulo state, the Federal Police said in a statement.
The two suspects were recruited and financed by the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and planned to target buildings tied to the Jewish community, according to an official with information about the plot who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The police statement did not give details about the suspects. It said police also executed 11 search warrants in Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and the Federal District that were aimed at obtaining proof of possible recruitment of Brazilians for carrying out extremist acts in the country, adding that it was targeting both recruits and recruiters.
Local paper O Globo reported that police arrested one of the two suspects when they returned to the international airport in Sao Paulo, with information in hand to carry out the attack. There are two additional targets for arrest in Lebanon, the paper reported, without saying how it obtained that information.
The Brazilian Israelite Confederation celebrated the police operation on X, formerly Twitter.
“The tragic conflicts in the Middle East cannot be imported into our country, where different communities live peacefully, harmoniously and without fear of terrorism,” the group said.
Brazil has one of the world’s largest Lebanese populations; most estimates put their total well above that of Lebanon itself.

US DRONE SHOT DOWN BY YEMEN’S HOUTHI REBELS
WASHINGTON — A U.S. drone was shot down by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Wednesday, according to the Iran-backed group’s military arm and a senior U.S. military official.
The Houthis said it was an MQ-9 Reaper drone that was in Yemeni air space and was shot down by air defenses. The senior U.S. official said the military is still analyzing the episode, including whether the drone was in international airspace or over Yemen. A second U.S. official said the MQ-9 Reaper was over international waters when it was shot down. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public.
The Houthis have fired at least four batches of drones and missiles toward southern Israel since Oct. 7. The group controls the capital and much of northern and western Yemen where the majority of the county’s population lives.

ISRAEL SAYS IT DESTROYED 130 HAMAS TUNNELS IN GAZA AND RELEASES VIDEO FROM INSIDE UNDERGROUND NETWORK
Israel’s military released video on Wednesday of what it says are combat engineers locating, entering and blowing up Hamas-built tunnels in the Gaza Strip.
Israel has destroyed 130 tunnels since the war began, according to Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman.
The videos show a soldier’s body camera footage inside what Israel said was a Hamas tunnel, its walls lined with cement and the shaft partially filled with sand. Another clip shows the mouth of what appears to be a tunnel in an open area near damaged buildings. There are clips of armored excavators and bulldozers digging in the dirt, as well as explosions apparently destroying tunnel entrances.
The Israeli military did not provide locations where the videos were filmed, and the images did not include any visible landmarks except for one shot showing the sea in the background, so The Associated Press could not independently confirm the videos.
Hamas is believed to have a massive underground network throughout Gaza, allowing it to transport weapons, supplies and fighters.
Israeli warplanes have bombed crowded urban neighborhoods, saying the strikes target the tunnel system or Hamas commanders. But airstrikes can inflict only limited damage on the subterranean network.
WHITE HOUSE SAYS ISRAEL TO KEEP MILITARY IN GAZA AFTER WAR, BUT RE-OCCUPYING IS A ‘MISTAKE’
WASHINGTON: U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said it was likely that Israel would maintain a military presence in Gaza for a “period of time” after the ongoing war, but said the U.S. believes it would be a “mistake” for Israel to re-occupy the territory.
“I think all of us can foresee a period of time after the conflict is over where Israeli forces will likely still be in Gaza and will have some initial security responsibilities,” Kirby told CNN on Wednesday. “But for how long and where and to what size and scale and scope, I think it’s too soon to know.” Kirby said the U.S. was focused on devising a long-term governance structure for Gaza after the current conflict, but said that as yet there has been little prospect of a viable plan.
“I think where we are is: a lot of questions, and not a lot of answers,” he said. “We know what we don’t want to see in Gaza post conflict, we don’t want to see Hamas in control, and we don’t want to see a re-occupation by Israel.”
He added: “We know that the United States can’t solve this alone,” and that the U.S. was engaging with regional and international partners on the matter.
PALESTINIANS FLEE ON FOOT FROM NORTHERN GAZA, DESCRIBING HUNGER, THIRST AND RELENTLESS BOMBING
BUREIJ REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip — A long line of thousands of Palestinians fled on foot from northern Gaza Wednesday — families, children and older adults, crying babies — carrying only what they could take in their arms or on their backs.
They were seen in Associated Press video walking down Gaza’s main north-south highway, heeding the Israeli military’s orders to evacuate during a five-hour window as its troops battled Hamas militants deep inside Gaza City. Some evacuees were pushing relatives in wheelchairs, with one older adult wheeled down the road in a hand truck.
Abeer Akeila left her home in Gaza city after relentless strikes forced all her neighbors to flee southward. She said life in the city has become increasingly difficult amid dwindling water and food supplies.
“There was shelling and bombardment overnight,” she said. “We didn’t have food or drinking water … They struck the bakeries. There is no life in Gaza.”
About 15,000 people fled northern Gaza on Tuesday — triple the number that left Monday — according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Many of the people walking south are refugees or their descendants who fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel in 1948.
ITALY TO STATION HOSPITAL SHIP OFF GAZA’S COAST
ROME — Italy is sending a hospital ship that will be stationed off the coast of Gaza to aid the Palestinian population, Defense Minister Guido Crosetto announced Wednesday.
Crosetto said the mission is a concrete sign of Italy’s “closeness to the Palestinian people, distance from the Hamas terrorists.”
The ship Vulcano has 170 people on board, including medical and military personnel, and includes operating rooms. It will first head to Cyprus and then as close as possible to the conflict zone to provide emergency medical support, Crosetto said.
ISRAEL TO LAUNCH FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO HAMAS ATTACK
JERUSALEM — Israel’s attorney general and state attorney are working with police and military to formally investigate the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, they announced Wednesday.
“Our goal is to investigate and initiate legal proceedings against those who perpetrated, planned and otherwise took part in these heinous acts -– wherever they are,” the statement said. It said Israel would punish the Hamas militants with “the utmost severity, commensurate with their crimes.”
Police are working to collect evidence from towns across the south as attorneys for the Ministry of Justice decide how best to proceed with the investigation.
SPAIN SAYS CITIZEN MISSING AFTER HAMAS ATTACK IS DEAD
MADRID — Spain’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that a Spaniard missing in Israel following the Hamas attack in October is dead. The ministry identified him as Iván Illarramendi. It declined to give any further details.
In a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, Israel’s ambassador to Spain, Rodica Radian-Gordon, said: “Our hearts are torn by the news of the brutal murder of Iván Illarramendi. He has been identified a month after the terrorist massacre committed by Hamas in Israel, along with his wife Dafna Garcovich.”
The Israeli Embassy was unable to say where the death occurred.
Spain’s state news agency Efe and other Spanish news outlets have reported that Illarramendi and his Chilean wife had been living in a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip.
The ministry confirmed the death of another Spaniard with Israeli citizenship, Maya Villalobo Sinvany, on Oct. 11.
Following the attacks, the ministry would only say that two Spaniards had been “affected” in the attacks.
Villalobo was reported to have been in military service at an Israeli miliary base at the time of the attack.
HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT STRUCK ISRAELI INFANTRY UNITS
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanese militant group Hezbollah claimed two attacks on Israeli infantry units in the areas of Shomera and Dovev on Wednesday which it said inflicted casualties on Israeli forces. There was no immediate confirmation of the casualties from the Israeli military.
Following the strikes, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency and an Associated Press journalist in south Lebanon reported heavy shelling in several border areas in Lebanon.
Hezbollah said in a statement that the attack on Dovev was in retaliation for Israeli forces targeting an ambulance in Lebanon. On Sunday, local Lebanese officials said an Israeli drone had struck near two ambulances on their way to pick up casualties from overnight strikes in southern Lebanon, wounding four paramedics. The Israeli army said it had launched strikes on a “terrorist cell” that was attempting to fire missiles toward Israel and hadn’t intentionally targeted the vehicles.
Another Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon on Sunday evening hit a car driving between the towns of Ainata and Aitaroun and killed three children and their grandmother and wounded the children’s mother. An Israeli military statement later said the car had been “identified as transporting terrorists” and that the military was reviewing “allegations that there were civilians in the vehicle.”
Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants and their allies have been clashing along the border since the start of the Israel-Hamas war a month ago. While the clashes remain largely contained, they have increased in intensity as Israel conducts a ground incursion in Gaza against Hezbollah ally Hamas.
UKRAINE EVACUATES 43 OF ITS NATIONALS AND 36 MOLDOVANS FROM GAZA
KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine has evacuated 43 of its nationals from the Gaza Strip and helped 36 Moldovan citizens reach safety in Egypt, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
Ukrainian diplomats helped the two groups get out of the war zone, Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X, formerly known as Twitter.
He said Ukraine was working with embassies in Israel and Egypt to get more of its citizens out of Gaza.
ISRAEL CABINET TO MEET IN WEST BANK FOLLOWING WARNINGS OF MORE VIOLENCE
JERUSALEM — Israel’s wartime security Cabinet will meet late Wednesday in the West Bank offices of the military’s Central Command “due to warnings by security officials about the potential for a serious escalation in violence” in the territory, the Ynet website reported, citing a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.
Israeli media reported last week that the Shin Bet security agency issued such a warning, noting an increase in violence by Jewish settlers.
Deadly violence has been surging in the Israeli-occupied West Bank as Israel’s military pursues Hamas militants following the group’s bloody Oct. 7 incursion into Israel from the Gaza Strip. The violence threatens to open another front in the war Israel launched against Hamas after it killed more than 1,400 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 people hostage.
As of Tuesday, 167 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank over the past month, mainly in clashes with Israeli troops. The toll since the beginning of the year was 371.
Some of the dead have been killed in violent anti-Israel protests, and Palestinians have said eight people were killed in attacks by settlers, who have intensified assaults and provocations since the war began.
Daily Israeli military arrest raids in the territory have intensified, with once-rare aerial attacks becoming much more common. The military said Wednesday that 1,430 wanted men have been arrested in the West Bank since Oct. 7, including more than 900 from Hamas.
G7 NATIONS ANNOUNCE A UNIFIED STANCE ON ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR
TOKYO — Top diplomats from the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies announced a unified stance on the Israel-Hamas war on Wednesday after intensive meetings in Tokyo, condemning Hamas, supporting Israel’s right to self-defense and calling for “humanitarian pauses” to speed aid to desperate civilians in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement following two days of talks, the nations sought to balance unequivocal criticism of Hamas’ attacks against Israel and “the need for urgent action” to help civilians in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
“All parties must allow unimpeded humanitarian support for civilians, including food, water, medical care, fuel and shelter, and access for humanitarian workers,” said the statement, hammered out by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy. “We support humanitarian pauses and corridors to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement and the release of hostages.”
MORE PALESTINIANS FLEEING COMBAT ZONE IN NORTHERN GAZA
JERUSALEM — The pace of Palestinian civilians fleeing the combat zone in northern Gaza has picked up as Israel’s air and ground campaign there intensifies, U.N. monitors said Wednesday. About 15,000 people fled on Tuesday, compared to 5,000 on Monday and 2,000 on Sunday, said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
The civilians flee during a four-hour window set daily by the Israeli military that assures safe passage from Gaza City and its surroundings to the south. Most of those fleeing were children, the elderly and people with disabilities, the U.N. agency said. Many arrived on foot with minimal belongings.
In a new development, some of those fleeing reported that they had to cross Israeli checkpoints to reach the south and that they had witnessed some arrests by Israeli forces. Others have said they had to walk past Israeli tanks with raised hands while waving white flags.
The densely populated northern area of Gaza, specifically Gaza City and adjacent urban refugee camps, are the focus of Israel’s campaign to crush Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years. The war, now in its second month, was triggered by the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel.
Tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians remain in the combat area, many sheltering at hospitals or U.N. schools. Some said they were deterred from moving south because of dire humanitarian conditions in the evacuation zone and ongoing Israeli airstrikes across Gaza, including the south.
U.N. monitors say some 1.5 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced.
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT TO CONVENE JUDICIAL SELECTION COMMITTEE
JERUSALEM — After months of refusal, Israeli Justice Minister Yariv Levin said he will convene the judicial selection committee on Nov. 16 to fill empty slots in the Supreme Court and lower benches.
The committee has been a central battleground in Levin’s plan to weaken the country’s judiciary because he wanted to change its makeup to give the government control over appointments. The proposed judicial overhaul touched off months of mass protests across the country by demonstrators who accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of seeking to weaken the only serious check on politicians.
Levin said earlier this week that he would convene the panel soon. In a letter Sunday to the Supreme Court, he said, “wartime is not the time to deal with controversial subjects,” and that he would bring before the panel candidates who have broad support.
The government maintains the courts have overstepped their powers and need to be reined in. The demonstrations against the proposed overhaul were put on hold after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,400 people and taking over 240 hostages, touching off a fierce Israeli assault to crush Hamas.
ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE HITS RESIDENTIAL AREA IN SOUTH GAZA
KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza — An Israeli airstrike struck a residential area in the Zannah neighborhood east of Khan Younis on Wednesday, destroying at least one house and damaging surrounding buildings.
First responders were searching the rubble for dead or wounded from the strike. At least three people -– two women and a child — were killed, according to an Associated Press journalist. Ambulances were transporting injured people to a hospital, the journalist said.
Khan Younis is in southern Gaza where Israel’s military ordered people in Gaza City and its surroundings to move.
EXPLOSIONS REPORTED ACROSS GAZA CITY AND SHATI REFUGEE CAMP
CAIRO — Residents reported loud explosions across Gaza City and the adjacent Shati refugee camp overnight into Wednesday, as Israel’s military said its troops were battling Hamas forces deep inside the densely populated urban area.
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said an airstrike Wednesday morning hit a house near the Jabaliya refugee camp, also part of that built-up area.
“The bombings were heavy and close,” said Mohamed Abed, who lives in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighborhood. He said people around him panicked when they heard the news late Tuesday that Israeli ground forces were fighting deep in the city.
Gaza City is the focus of Israel’s military campaign, now in its second month, to crush the Hamas militant group, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years. The war was triggered by a deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7.
40 FILIPINOS FLEE GAZA THROUGH RAFAH CROSSING INTO EGYPT
MANILA, Philippines — Dozens of Filipinos fled from the war-ravaged Gaza Strip into Egypt through the Rafah crossing after Filipino diplomats negotiated for their safe passage and Qatar mediated for the border to be opened, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Wednesday.
The 40 Filipinos were traveling to the Egyptian capital of Cairo, where they planned to take flights back to the Philippines, Marcos said in a video message in Manila. Two Filipino doctors managed to leave the Gaza Strip into Egypt last week.
“I hope the rest of our countrymen who also wanted to return home can also exit properly with their spouses and loved ones,” Marcos said.
Most of at least 134 Filipinos in Gaza, many of whom are married to Palestinians, have sought help to leave the besieged territory and are waiting for an opportunity to leave, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said.",N
"China's giant pandas have left the D.C.

Their exit was accorded all the pomp of the presidential motorcades that zip through Washington: police escorts, waving bystanders and trailing journalists.
The aircraft, loaded with 220 pounds of bamboo, a veterinarian and two zookeepers, took off for the 19-hour flight from Dulles International Airport to China. There, the bears will join about 150 other pandas in a lush nature preserve in the misty mountains of Sichuan province.
And with that, an era of panda diplomacy ends, at least for now.
âItâs been a hard week, and itâs been a hard morning,â Brandie Smith, the zoo director, told us journalists as we watched the crates with their furry occupants being moved by forklifts from the bamboo-lined Asia Trail area.
âPlease know that the future is bright for giant pandas,â she added. âWe remain committed to our program, and we look forward to celebrating with all of you when pandas can return to D.C.â
Panda diplomacy here began when Patricia Nixon, the first lady, mentioned her fondness for pandas â âI love themâ â to Chinaâs premier, Zhou Enlai, during the landmark visit she and President Richard Nixon made to Beijing in 1972. Within two months, China had sent a female and a male panda, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, to the National Zoo.
The panda presence in Washington has persisted ever since as a symbol of the ties between the United States and China.
The black-and-white fur balls that might as well be waddling stuffies had always struck me as natural diplomats: When I was living and working in Beijing, I took my family to the panda research center in the city of Chengdu, and my 3-1/2-year-old daughter developed an enduring obsession with them.
But U.S.-China tensions have been rising for years, and now there is speculation that China is asking for the return of the pandas because of the diplomatic deep freeze.
Zoo officials and scientists say the actual reason comes down to biology, or âpanda time.â The three pandas, they say, are each at an age when they should be going back to China.
Mei Xiang and Tian Tian arrived in 2000, about one year after Hsing-Hsing was euthanized due to kidney disease and eight years after Ling Lingâs passing from heart failure. The two new pandas stayed for a decade under the first formal pact, then remained under two consecutive five-year agreements. That last one ended early in the pandemic, and the partner association in China agreed to a three-year extension, which is about to expire.
Mei Xiang gave birth in August 2020, at an age when scientists had thought she would no longer be able to have a baby. And so the cub was named Xiao Qi Ji, or Little Miracle. He was her fourth surviving cub born in Washington.
Zoos that host pandas outside China usually agree to send cubs back before they turn 4 and to send adults back when they are elderly; Mei Xiang is 25 and Tian Tian 26.
âThey are at the age when they should be in China,â said Melissa Songer, a conservation biologist at the zoo who has worked with the pandas for 23 years. âI donât want to have a panda pass away outside of China.â
Zoo Atlanta now has the only giant pandas in the United States â parents and twin cubs â but they are expected to return to China next year. An aging mother and her son in the San Diego Zoo returned in 2019, and Ya Ya, a female panda in the Memphis Zoo, flew back this April. Her companion, Le Le, was due to return with her but died in February from heart disease at age 25, an event that infuriated some Chinese citizens.
It takes more than bamboo groves to host a panda. For starters, the National Zoo paid a fee to a Chinese conservation partner of $500,000 per year for a pair (down from $1 million during Mei Xiang and Tian Tianâs first decade here).
Despite the costs, the four U.S. zoos that have consistently hosted pandas have worked with two separate conservation groups in China to secure the agreements. Songer said the National Zoo intends to ask its partner, the China Wildlife Conservation Association, for a new pair.
Xu Xueyuan, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese Embassy, did not mention the prospects of that in remarks Wednesday with Smith, the zoo director. She did say that the âcollaboration has contributed strongly to the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.â
âGiant pandas belong to China,â she said. âGiant pandas belong to the world.â
Until recently, pandas were considered endangered, and so scientists at the National Zoo researched reproductive cycles to help with panda breeding. Songer said a female panda is fertile for only one or two days each year, and scientists monitor hormone levels using urine samples to determine when to do artificial insemination. That is how Little Miracle was born.
âWe have it figured out. China has it figured out,â Songer said. âItâs been a huge success to reproduce them under human care.â
The panda population in China has grown, and now scientists are experimenting with reintroducing pandas into the wild.
Early Sunday morning, my daughter, Aria, now 11, and I watched as mother, father and son lumbered around their separate indoor and outdoor enclosures, chewing on bamboo, tumbling with plastic balls and clambering over boulders.
We wondered whether they knew they were going to a new home. Zookeepers had been training them for weeks to get used to the transport crates.
They looked about as cuddly as the stuffed pandas that Aria slept with every night. Aria regaled me with endless panda trivia: âDid you know that they eat 14 hours a day?â
The crowds ballooned, creating a sense of panda-monium.
Some had been coming daily, and some were making a repeat visit after popping in during the nine-day Panda Palooza festival earlier this fall. Others had heard the pandas were leaving and had traveled hundreds or thousands of miles to catch a glimpse.
âThis will be the only animal I check out all day,â said Denise Fesser, 47, who had driven nearly three hours that morning from New Jersey. She had a zoo membership because of the pandas and visited several times a year. When she travels abroad, she flies in and out of Washington so she can see them.
âXiao Qi Ji is the most fun to watch,â she said as she shot a few photos of him using a zoom lens. âIt was one of those moments of pure joy when he was born during the pandemic.â
The Allen family drove eight hours from Charlotte, North Carolina, to see the pandas for the first time.
âI watched the panda cam every day during the pandemic,â said one of the children, Anna Kate, referring to cameras that the zoo had set up years ago to broadcast a panda reality show online.
âMaybe theyâll figure out how to make a pact for them to come back here to their home,â said her mother, Gillian Allen. She paused. âBut China is really their home.â",N

"Man killed after pointing gun at Baltimore police, officials say",2023-11-07,2023-11-08T04:43:31Z,en,seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108044331id_/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108044331/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcykvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL25hdGlvbi9tYW4ta2lsbGVkLWFmdGVyLXBvaW50aW5nLWd1bi1hdC1iYWx0aW1vcmUtcG9saWNlLW9mZmljaWFscy1zYXk_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXJzc19hbGwmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1yZWZlcnJhbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPXJzcw~~,"BALTIMORE (AP) â Baltimore police officers shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them following a foot pursuit Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed.
Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said.
One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasnât the case, Worley said.
Officials havenât determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also havenât determined whether the armed man fired his handgun.
The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasnât been released.
The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Departmentâs specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they donât wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said.
The teams drew scrutiny earlier this year after a police shooting that unfolded under similar circumstances and left a teen in critical condition â less than a mile from the scene of Tuesdayâs shooting. In that case, too, officers tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was carrying a gun. He ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind.
In this case as in the previous shooting, Worley defended the officersâ actions. He said they were conducting âproactive patrolsâ aimed at preventing violence. He also said they yelled at the man multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire.
âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said during a news conference at the scene. âWe donât know what he was up to with that weapon.â
Department policy says officers are allowed to use deadly force when they believe itâs âimmediately necessaryâ to protect another officer or civilian from âimminent danger of death or serious physical injury.â In the case of a fleeing suspect, officers can use deadly force to prevent the person from escaping under certain circumstances.
âWhile we are very early in this investigation, we know that incidents like this really pull the heart out of the community,â said Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, thanking city police officers for what they do.
But praise for the cityâs police department has been hard to come by in recent years. The agency has implemented significant reform measures under a federal consent decree established in 2017 that mandates a series of court-ordered changes to eliminate unconstitutional policing practices and improve community trust. The agreement was reached after the U.S. Justice Department discovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing.
The DOJ investigation was launched after Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries in Baltimore police custody. Not long after the consent decree was announced, the Gun Trace Task Force scandal revealed abuse and corruption inside an elite plainclothes unit.
An assessment earlier this year found officers are significantly less likely to use force against members of the public than they were before the consent decree was put in place.",N

Police Chief Terri Theetge told reporters Sunday that a shooter in a sedan fired 22 rounds âin quick successionâ into a crowd of children just before 9:30 p.m. Friday on the cityâs West End. No suspect has been arrested.
A 53-year-old woman was hit along with the boy who died; three other boys aged 12, 13 and 15; and a 15-year-old girl. One victim was hospitalized in stable condition.
A memorial where Dominic and the other children were shot lines the sidewalk with pictures, stuffed animals and dozens of colorful balloons. A GoFundMe page helped raise money for funeral costs.
Theetge said it was too early to say whether the shooting was random or targeted and declined to discuss other aspects of the investigation.
The shots were fired in a âvibrant neighborhoodâ next to a park and near a historic elementary school, Mayor Aftab Pureval said at the news conference.
Dominic Davis’ father, Issac Davis, appeared at the Sunday news conference along with Dominic’s mother and grandmother to urge whoever was responsible to turn themselves in.
âWhen will this stop? Will this ever stop?â Issac Davis asked. âHow many people have to bury their kids, their babies, their loved ones?â
Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence protection group, said it counted nearly 300 shootings this year in Cincinnati, including some 30 in the neighborhood where Dominic Davis was killed three days ago.
âNo family should be forced to wonder how they will make it through. No child should be gunned down. No family should be shattered because of senseless gun violence,â said Pastor Jackie L. Jackson, a Cincinnati resident and program manager of the Everytown Survivor Network. âAt some point, for the sake of our children, families, communities, and our country, we must do more to keep them safe.â
Pureval called it âa horrific tragedy.”
âOur friends and neighbors are feeling unimaginable fear, trauma, and anger,â Pureval said and vowed to âgive everything we have to deliver justice against this sickening, heartless violence.â
Pureval also said that the West End neighborhood is suffering âunimaginable traumaâ and that residents are wary of leaving their homes.
âThe parents, and the kids themselves we talked to, donât feel safe, and I frankly canât blame them,â he said.

(AP) â A 15-year-old boy was arrested in connection with a shooting that injured four people inside a restaurant south of San Diego last month, police said.
The youth was taken into custody Friday evening, the Chula Vista Police Department said in a press release on Saturday.
âDue to his age, no additional suspect information is being released at this time,â the release said.
The Oct. 28 gunfire prompted chaos inside NOVO Brazil in Chula Vista and fears of an active shooter loose in the Otay Ranch Town Center, causing police to lock down the mall.
Authorities said at the time that they believed the shooting resulted from a dispute between two groups of people. The statement on the arrest said no other information was available for public release.
The victims included a 16-year-old boy shot in the legs who investigators say was involved in the initial dispute. Two bystanders, a 58-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman, were also struck. A third bystander, a 21-year-old woman, suffered a graze wound. None of the wounds were life-threatening.
The city of Chula Vista is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of San Diego.",N

Gunfire broke out around 10 p.m. Sunday at a Prairie View A&M University homecoming party near the school’s campus, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of downtown Houston, according to the Waller County Sheriff’s Office.
Detectives arrived at the âtrail ride pasture partyâ and found two men, two women and a male minor had been shot, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. They all suffered gunshot wounds âto their lower extremitiesâ that appeared not to be life threatening, according to the statement.
The sheriff’s office said more than 1,000 people attended the party and that police were called after an argument escalated into gunfire. Investigators are unclear on how many people opened fire but said each of those injured was a bystander.
A promotor, who authorities did not identify by name, held the party in the open fields a short drive from the university’s campus. It had been approved by Waller County’s top official but none of the agreed-to security protocols were being followed at the time of the shooting, the sheriff’s office said.
Local television news footage showed ambulances and at least one emergency helicopter responding to the shooting Sunday. By Monday morning, the pasture where the party had been held could be seen strewn with trash and empty save for a couple abandoned vehicles.
Prairie View A&M is a historically Black college with more than 9,000 students. Sunday’s shooting came a month after gunfire interrupted a homecoming event at a historically Black college in Maryland, wounding five people and prompting an hours-long lockdown.
Police later arrested a 17-year-old in the shooting at Baltimoreâs Morgan State University and put out an arrest warrant for an 18-year-old man. They said neither were students at the school.",N

âI will make sure for sure this time that when I finish my time being incarcerated to stay the faithful, righteous person I am this day,â the man, Zackey Rahimi, wrote. He added that he wanted âto stay away from all firearms and weapons, and to never be away from my family again.â
Despite Rahimiâs vows in the July 25 letter addressed to a local judge and prosecutor, gun rights advocates acknowledge that he is not an ideal poster boy for the Second Amendment.
âItâs a fundamental strategic goal to present cases in the most favorable light possible, and that would include having a sympathetic and relatable person,â said Clark Neily, the senior vice president for legal studies at the Cato Institute, which has advocated gun rights. âI donât know anyone who would see Zackey Rahimi as either of these things.â
Rahimi, 23, of Texas, faces not only multiple gun-related charges, but prosecutors also say that after a judge barred Rahimi from carrying weapons under a domestic violence protective order, he participated in a string of five shootings over just two months.
A panel of judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that he was âhardly a model citizen,â even as they sided with him.
Rahimiâs case could expand gun rights protections by undoing a federal law that makes it a felony to possess a gun while under a domestic violence protective order. Although the case has garnered a flood of amicus briefs from groups such as the National Rifle Association, the Second Amendment Foundation and the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, the organizations have largely shifted focus away from Rahimi.
âI think that a lot of times, the gun rights advocates who litigate these cases, as with other impact litigation, try to reverse-engineer the case with the most compelling litigants, and this case simply does not fit with that strategy,â said Eric Ruben, an associate law professor at Southern Methodist University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. âYou could imagine a different case challenging this same law with a much more sympathetic plaintiff.â
Rahimi declined an interview request, but court and police records paint a portrait of a troubled young man who turned to drugs and guns after growing up in poverty in a family that immigrated to Texas from Afghanistan. Painfully shy and overweight, he said he was a target for school bullies.
He felt financial pressure from a young age to help support his family, and he earned money by detailing cars, mowing lawns and moving appliances. He built a successful business flipping used cars, he wrote, before he âstarted hanging around the wrong crowd.â He began âsmoking marijuana, drinking alcohol, doing pills and all type of mess.â
He said he wanted to take responsibility for his decisions, that âit was all my fault from Day 1 for being around that circle.â
Rahimiâs letter does not directly address the incidents that led to his incarceration or give any mention of his Supreme Court case, but state and federal court records lay out the charges against him.
In December 2019, Rahimi and his girlfriend got into an argument in a Texas parking lot. During the fight, Rahimi knocked the woman to the ground, dragged her to his car and shoved her inside, according to court records. When he realized that a bystander was watching, he pulled out a gun and fired a shot.
Rahimiâs girlfriend ran away from him, and he later called her and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone what had happened, records show.
A Texas judge issued a two-year restraining order in February 2020 against Rahimi, who has a child with the woman. The judge found he had âcommitted family violenceâ and that such violence was âlikely to occur again in the future.â As part of the order, the judge suspended Rahimiâs handgun license.
Prosecutors say Rahimi flagrantly defied the courtâs order. In August 2020, he reached out to his girlfriend on social media and went to her house in the middle of the night. In November 2020, prosecutors say he threatened another woman with a gun, leading to his arrest on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
According to a brief by the governmentâs lawyers, after someone who bought drugs from him âstarted talking trashâ online, he fired an AR-15 at the manâs house. The next day, during a traffic crash, they say, he shot at a driver. He is accused of firing a gun into the air in a residential neighborhood three days after that. A few weeks later, after a truck flashed its headlights at him, prosecutors say he followed the truck and shot at another car. In January, they say, he fired shots in the air after his friendâs credit card was declined at a Whataburger restaurant.
During a search of Rahimiâs bedroom in January 2021, detectives say they found a loaded Glock and a rifle, along with a copy of the domestic violence protective order.
A grand jury indicted Rahimi on charges of violating the federal law that prohibits a person under such an order from having a gun, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Rahimi argued the law violated the Second Amendment.
At Rahimiâs sentencing, a prosecutor said that âitâs a miracle of God that he hasnât killed anybody.â
âYouâre talking about six separate shootings here,â Frank Gatto, the prosecutor, told the judge. âAnd to me that first video, where he causes this accident, gets out and just starts shooting, is one of the most bone-chilling videos for me to watch and see. If that doesnât send chills down anybodyâs spine seeing that, I donât know of much else that can.â
Rahimiâs lawyer argued that he was still maturing and noted that Rahimi had a supportive family who wanted to help him.
After the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the 5th Circuit overturned Rahimiâs conviction, finding the federal law violated the Second Amendment. The appeals court based its reasoning on the fact that it could find no analogous historical law from the 1700s or 1800s.
The government asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.
Rahimi remains in the county jail, awaiting the outcome of pending state criminal charges.
âI had firearms for the right reason in our place to be able to protect my family at all times,â he wrote in his letter. He added that he would do whatever it took âto be able to come home fast as I can to take care of my familyâ at all times.",N

Protests against the proposed training center â dubbed âCop City by opponents â have been going on for more than two years. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr obtained a sweeping indictment in August, using the state’s anti-racketeering law to target the protesters and characterizing them as âmilitant anarchists.”
Demonstrators and civil rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have condemned the indictment and accused Carr, a Republican, of levying heavy-handed charges to try to silence a movement that has galvanized environmentalists and anti-police protesters across the country.
All 61 people indicted were scheduled to be arraigned Monday, that is to have the charges against them formally read in court. Fifty-seven of them appeared, called in small groups before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kimberly Esmond Adams over a three-hour period, and each waived arraignment.
Four defendants failed to appear. One was believed to be in France and prosecutors didn’t have a good address for him. One was in federal immigration custody. Another who is not American and who had left the country tried to return twice in recent days to attend the hearing but was denied entry to the country, her lawyer said. A fourth simply didn’t show.
Most of the people who appeared had not yet surrendered at the Fulton County Jail to be booked on their charges. Some had recently reached agreements with prosecutors on a bond amount and conditions and others were still in the process of doing so.
Adams told them they had until 10 a.m. Tuesday, 24 hours after the start of the arraignment proceedings, to turn themselves in. If they fail to do so, she warned, a warrant for their arrest could be issued and any bond would be rescinded.
Adams instructed defense attorneys to provide the attorney general’s office with hard drives by Friday so they can receive copies of evidence in the case, known as discovery. Prosecutors are to finish copying and distributing that evidence to defense attorneys by the end of the year.
A final plea hearing will be set no later than the end of June, Adams said. She explained to the groups of defendants that if they want to reach a plea agreement with prosecutors they must do it by that date.
A couple of hundred supporters of the âStop Cop Cityâ effort rallied outside the courthouse in downtown Atlanta on Monday morning singing, chanting and waving signs.
Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and other supporters say the 85-acre, $90 million facility would replace inadequate training facilities, and would help address difficulties in hiring and retaining police officers. Opponents have expressed concern that that it could lead to greater police militarization and that its construction in the South River Forest will worsen environmental damage in a poor, majority-Black area.
Protests against the project, which have at time resulted in violence and vandalism, escalated after the fatal shooting in January of 26-year-old protester Manuel Esteban Paez TerÃ¡n, known as Tortuguita. A prosecutor last month said he would not pursue charges against the state troopers who shot Paez TerÃ¡n, saying he found that their use of deadly force was âobjectively reasonable.â
Most of those indicted in August had already been charged over their alleged involvement in the movement. RICO charges carry a sentence of five to 20 years in prison that can be added on top of the penalty for the underlying acts.
Among the defendants: more than three dozen people who were previously facing domestic terrorism charges in connection to the protests; three leaders of a bail fund previously accused of money laundering; and three activists previously charged with felony intimidation after authorities said they distributed flyers calling a state trooper a âmurdererâ for his involvement in Paez TerÃ¡n’s death.
Prosecutors have alleged a conspiracy that includes a wide variety of underlying crimes that range from possessing fire accelerant and throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers to being reimbursed for glue and food for activists who spent months camping in the woods near the construction site.

In their first guns case since last yearâs expansion of gun rights, the justices suggested that they will reverse a ruling from an appeals court in New Orleans that struck down the 1994 ban on firearms for people under court order to stay away from their spouses or partners.
The courtâs decision could affect other cases in which other gun laws have been called into question, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. President Joe Bidenâs son has been charged with buying a firearm while he was addicted to drugs, but his lawyers have indicated they will challenge the indictment.
Liberal and conservative justices sounded persuaded by arguments from the Biden administration’s top Supreme Court lawyer that the prohibition is in line with the longstanding practice of disarming dangerous people.
The case before the court involves a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her.
The justices peppered Rahimi’s lawyer, J. Matthew Wright, with skeptical questions that seemed to foretell the outcome.
âYou don’t have any doubt that your client is a dangerous person, do you?â Chief Justice John Roberts asked Wright. When Wright said it depends on what Roberts meant by dangerous, the chief justice shot back, “Well, it means someone whoâs shooting, you know, at people. Thatâs a good start.”
Justice Brett Kavanaugh voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Democratic administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders.
The federal appeals court in New Orleans struck down the domestic violence law, following the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms.
Justice Clarence Thomas’ opinion for the court tossed out the balancing test judges had long used to decide whether gun laws were constitutional. Rather than consider whether a law enhances public safety, judges should only weigh whether it fits into the nationâs history of gun regulation, Thomas wrote for the six conservative justices on the nine-member court.
The Bruen decision has resulted in lower court rulings striking down more than a dozen laws. Those include age restrictions; bans on homemade ghost guns, which don’t have serial numbers; and prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of nonviolent felonies or using illegal drugs.
Justice Elena Kagan noted that âthere seems to be a fair bit of division and a fair bit of confusion about what Bruen means and what Bruen requires in the lower courts.â
Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the domestic violence law, urged the justices to use this case to correct lower courts’ âprofound misreadingâ of the decision.
It was unclear how far the high court would go in this case, and some of the justices sounded interested in a limited ruling that might leave open other challenges to the same law. âDo we need to get into any of that?â Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Prelogar.
Rahimi, who lived near Fort Worth, Texas, hit his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and then fired a gun at a witness in December 2019, according to court papers. Later, Rahimi called the girlfriend and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone about the assault, the Justice Department wrote in its Supreme Court brief.
The girlfriend obtained a protective order against him in Tarrant County in February 2020.
Eleven months later, Rahimi was a suspect in shootings when police searched his apartment and found guns. He eventually pleaded guilty to violating federal law. The appeals court overturned that conviction when it struck down the law. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Biden administration’s appeal.
Rahimi remains jailed in Texas, where he faces other criminal charges. In a letter he wrote from jail last summer, after the Supreme Court agreed to hear his case, Rahimi said he would âstay away from all firearms and weaponsâ once he’s released. The New York Times first reported the existence of the letter.
Guns were used in 57% of killings of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in 2020, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seventy women a month, on average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety.
âGuns and domestic are a deadly combination,â Prelogar said in court Tuesday.
A decision in U.S. v. Rahimi, 22-915, is expected by early summer.

Committee To Protect Journalists: Journalist Casualties Rising In Widening Israel-Gaza War,2023-11-06,2023-11-09T01:39:39Z,en,blackstarnews.com,https://blackstarnews.com/committee-to-protect-journalists-journalist-casualties-rising-in-widening-israel-gaza-war/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231109013939id_/https://blackstarnews.com/committee-to-protect-journalists-journalist-casualties-rising-in-widening-israel-gaza-war/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231109013939/https://blackstarnews.com/committee-to-protect-journalists-journalist-casualties-rising-in-widening-israel-gaza-war/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJsYWNrc3Rhcm5ld3MpL2NvbW1pdHRlZS10by1wcm90ZWN0LWpvdXJuYWxpc3RzLWpvdXJuYWxpc3QtY2FzdWFsdGllcy1yaXNpbmctaW4td2lkZW5pbmctaXNyYWVsLWdhemEtd2Fy,"Photos: YouTube Screenshots
The Israel-Gaza war has taken a severe toll on journalists since Hamas launched its unprecedented attack against Israel on October 7 and Israel declared war on the militant Palestinian group, launching strikes on the blockaded Gaza Strip.
CPJ is investigating all reports of journalists and media workers killed, injured, or missing in the war, which has led to the deadliest month for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.
As of November 6, CPJ’s preliminary investigations showed at least 36 journalists and media workers were among an estimated 11,000 killed since the war began on October 7—with more than 9,700 Palestinian deaths in Gaza and the West Bank, and 1,400 deaths in Israel.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Reuters and Agence France Press news agencies that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip, after they had sought assurances that their journalists would not be targeted by Israeli strikes, Reuters reported on October 27.
Journalists in Gaza face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict in the face of an Israeli ground assault on Gaza City, devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, and extensive power outages.
As of November 6:
- 36 journalists and media workers were confirmed dead: 31 Palestinian, 4 Israeli, and 1 Lebanese.
- 8 journalists were reported injured.
- 3 journalists were reported missing.
- 8 journalists were reported arrested.
- Multiple assaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and killings of family members.
CPJ is also investigating numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt, or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes.
“CPJ emphasizes that journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. “Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heart-breaking conflict. Those in Gaza, in particular, have paid, and continue to pay, an unprecedented toll and face exponential threats. Many have lost colleagues, families, and media facilities, and have fled seeking safety when there is no safe haven or exit.”
The list published here includes names based on information obtained from CPJ’s sources in the region and media reports. It includes all journalists* involved in news-gathering activity. It is unclear whether all of these journalists were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths, but CPJ has included them in our count as we investigate their circumstances. The list is being updated on a regular basis.

Javier Ortiz came home from a secret mission in Syria, the ghost of a dead girl appeared to him in his kitchen. She was pale and covered in chalky dust, as if hit by an explosion, and her eyes stared at him with a glare as dark and heavy as oil.
The 21-year-old Marine was part of an artillery gun crew that fought against the Islamic State group, and he knew that his unitâs huge cannons had killed hundreds of enemy fighters. The ghost, he was sure, was their revenge.
A shiver went through him. He backed into another room in his apartment near Camp Pendleton in California and flicked on the lights, certain that he was imagining things. She was still there.
A few days later, in the barracks not far away, a 22-year-old Marine, Lance Cpl. Austin Powell, pounded on his neighborâs door in tears and stammered, âThereâs something in my room! Iâm hearing something in my room!â
His neighbor, Lance Cpl. Brady Zipoy, 20, searched the room but found nothing.
âItâs all right; Iâve been having problems, too,â Zipoy said, tapping his head. The day before, he bent down to tie his boots and was floored by a sudden avalanche of emotion so overwhelming and bizarre that he had no words for it. âWeâll go see the doc,â he told his friend. âWeâll get help.â
All through their unit â Alpha Battery, 1st Battalion, 11th Marines â troops came home feeling cursed. And the same thing was happening in other Marine and Army artillery units.
An investigation by The New York Times found that many of the troops sent to bombard the Islamic State in 2016 and 2017 returned to the United States plagued by nightmares, panic attacks, depression and, in a few cases, hallucinations. Once-reliable Marines turned unpredictable and strange. Some are now homeless. A striking number eventually died by suicide, or tried to.
Interviews with more than 40 gun crew veterans and their families in 16 states found that the military repeatedly struggled to determine what was wrong after the troops returned from Syria and Iraq.
All the gun crews filled out questionnaires to screen for post-traumatic stress disorder and took tests to detect signs of traumatic brain injuries from enemy explosions. But the crews had been miles away from the front lines when they fired their long-range cannons, and most never saw direct fighting or suffered the kinds of combat injuries that the tests were designed to look for.
A few gun crew members were eventually given diagnoses of PTSD, but to the crews, that didnât make much sense. They hadnât, in most cases, even seen the enemy.
The only thing remarkable about their deployments was the sheer number of artillery rounds they had fired.
The United States had made a strategic decision to avoid sending large numbers of ground troops to fight the Islamic State, and instead relied on airstrikes and a handful of powerful artillery batteries to, as one retired general said at the time, âpound the bejesus out of them.â The strategy worked: Islamic State positions were all but eradicated, and hardly any U.S. troops were killed.
But it meant that a small number of troops had to fire tens of thousands of high-explosive shells â far more rounds per crew member, experts say, than any U.S. artillery battery had fired at least since the Vietnam War.
Military guidelines say that firing all those rounds is safe. What happened to the crews suggests that those guidelines were wrong.
The cannon blasts were strong enough to hurl a 100-pound round 15 miles, and each unleashed a shock wave that shot through the crew membersâ bodies, vibrating bone, punching lungs and hearts, and whipping at cruise-missile speeds through the most delicate organ of all: the brain.
More than a year after Marines started experiencing problems, the Marine Corps leadership tried to piece together what was happening by ordering a study of one of the hardest-hit units, Fox Battery, 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines.
The research was limited to reviewing the troopsâ medical records. No Marines were examined or interviewed. Even so, the report, published in 2019, made a startling finding: The gun crews were being hurt by their own weapons.
More than half the Marines in the battery had eventually received diagnoses of traumatic brain injuries, according to a briefing prepared for Marine Corps headquarters. The report warned that the experience in Syria showed that firing a high number of rounds, day after day, could incapacitate crews âfaster than combat replacements can be trained to replace them.â
The military did not seem to be taking the threat seriously, the briefing cautioned: Safety training â both for gun crews and medical personnel â was so deficient, it said, that the risks of repeated blast exposure âare seemingly ignored.â
Despite the concerns raised in the report, no one appears to have warned the commanders responsible for the gun crews. And no one told the hundreds of troops who had fired the rounds.
Instead, in case after case, the military treated the crewsâ combat injuries as routine psychiatric disorders, if they treated them at all. Troops were told they had attention deficit disorder or depression. Many were given potent psychotropic drugs that made it hard to function and failed to provide much relief.
Others who started acting strangely after the deployments were simply dismissed as problems, punished for misconduct and forced out of the military in punitive ways that cut them off from the veteransâ health care benefits that they now desperately need.
The Marine Corps has never commented publicly on the findings of the study. It declined to say who ordered it or why and would not make the staff members who conducted it available for interviews. Officers who were in charge of the artillery batteries declined to comment for this article or did not respond to interview requests.
The silence has left the affected veterans to try to figure out for themselves what is happening.
Many never have.
Powell, who was hearing things in his room, left the Marines and became a tow truck driver in Kentucky, but he kept having paralyzing panic attacks on the road. In 2018, a year and a half after returning from Syria, he shot himself.
His neighbor in the barracks, Zipoy, moved back to his parentsâ house in Minnesota and started college. In 2020, he began hearing voices and seeing hidden messages in street signs. A few days later, in the grips of a psychotic delusion, he entered a house he had never been in before and killed a man he had never met.
When the police arrived, they found him wandering barefoot in the driveway. As they handcuffed him, he asked, âAre you going to take me to the moon?â
He was found not guilty of murder by reason of mental illness in 2021 and was committed to a locked ward of the Minnesota Security Hospital. He is still there today.
âOh, my God, I was out of my mind. There was no understanding of what was happening,â he recalled in a recent interview from the hospital, rubbing his fists against his temples.
âIâm angry, because I tried to get help in the Marines,â he said. âI knew something was wrong, but everybody just kind of blew it off.â
Unclassifiable injuries
When Ortiz started seeing a ghost a few days after returning from Syria in 2017, it didnât occur to him that he had been hurt by his own cannon. Instead, he was convinced that the enemy had put a hex on him.
He tried to purify himself by lighting a fire on the beach near Camp Pendleton and burning his old combat gloves and journal from the deployment. But after the ashes cooled, the ghost was still there.
For the next four years, he tried to play down his problems and make a career in the Marine Corps. He started a family. He was promoted to sergeant. He received a diagnosis of PTSD and was given various medications, but his panic attacks and hallucinations persisted. He started to have problems with his heart and digestion, too.
He eventually asked for a transfer to a special medical battalion set up to give Marines who are wounded in combat a place to recover. But there was little in his record to suggest that he had seen combat or been wounded. His request was denied.
One Friday night in October 2020, he was having visions that ghosts were trying to pull him into another dimension. He stretched out naked on his kitchen floor, hoping that the cool touch of the tiles would restore his grip on reality. It didnât work. In a panic, he called a cousin who had served in Iraq. His cousin said that what always worked for his PTSD was marijuana.
Ortiz bought some at a civilian dispensary. Although using marijuana is a crime in the military, he took a few puffs, relaxed and went to sleep.
The next Monday, he admitted to his commanding officer what he had done. He apologized and told her that he had already referred himself to a Marine substance abuse program.
The Marine Corps has regulations to ensure that Marines who break the rules because of PTSD or brain injuries are not punished for their missteps if their condition makes them unfit for duty. But records show that the Marine Corps decided Ortiz had no qualifying injuries.
In 2021, he was forced out for willful misconduct and given an other-than-honorable discharge that cut him off from access to therapy, medication, disability payments and other support intended for wounded veterans.
This spring, he and his family were squatting in a house in Kissimmee, Florida, that was going through foreclosure. The lights were off, and the kitchen sink was overflowing with dishes. He stammered as he tried to recount his experiences, with a memory he said is now full of blanks.
He has two young children and has struggled to hold a job. Bills have piled up. The headaches are crushing, he said, and he feels that his memory is becoming worse. When asked about the apparition of the dead girl, he started to cry and lowered his voice so his wife wouldnât hear. He admitted that he still saw the ghost â and other things.
âI gave the Marine Corps everything,â he said. âAnd they spit me out with nothing. Damaged, damaged, very damaged.â
Unseen risks
Firing weapons is as fundamental to military service as tackling is to football. And research has started to reveal that, as with hits in football, repeated blast exposure from firing heavy weapons like cannons, mortars, shoulder-fired rockets and even large-caliber machine guns may cause irreparable injury to the brain. It is a sprawling problem that the military is just starting to come to grips with.
The science is still in its infancy, but evidence suggests that while individual blasts rippling through brain tissue may not cause obvious, lasting injury, repeated exposure appears to create scarring that eventually could cause neural connections to fail, according to Gary Kamimori, a senior Army blast researcher who retired recently after a career studying the problem.
âThink of it like a rubber band,â he said. âStretch a rubber band a hundred times, and it bounces back, but there are micro-tears forming. The hundred-and-first time, it breaks.â
Those blasts might never cause a person to see stars or experience other signs of concussion, but over time, they may lead to sleeplessness, depression, anxiety and other symptoms that in many ways resemble PTSD, according to Dr. Daniel Perl, a neuropathologist who runs a Defense Department tissue bank that preserves dead veteransâ brains for research.
âItâs common to mistake a blast injury in the brain for something else, because when you walk into a clinic, it looks like a lot of other things,â Perl said.
His lab has examined samples from hundreds of deceased veterans who were exposed to enemy explosions and blasts from firing weapons during their military careers. The researchers found a unique and consistent pattern of microscopic scarring.
Finding that pattern in living veterans is another matter. There is currently no brain scan or blood test that can detect the minute injuries, Perl said; the damage can be seen only under microscopes once a service member has died. So there is no definitive way to tell whether a living person is injured. Even if there were, there is no therapy to fix it.
The lab hasnât examined any brains from artillery units sent to fight the Islamic State, but Perl said that he would not be surprised if many of them were affected. âYou have a blast wave traveling at the speed of sound through the most complex and intricate organ in the body,â he said. âWouldnât you think there would be some damage?â
The military for generations set maximum safe blast-exposure levels for eardrums and lungs but never for brains. Anything that didnât leave troops dazed was generally considered safe. But that has recently changed.
Over the past decade, veterans suffering from brain injurylike symptoms after years of firing weapons pressured Congress to rethink the potential dangers, and lawmakers passed a number of bills from 2018 to 2022 ordering the Pentagon to start a sprawling âWarfighter Brain Health Initiativeâ to try to measure blast exposure and develop protocols to protect troops.
âThere is an absolutely clear awareness this can be considered a brain health threat,â said Kathy Lee, director of casualty management for the Office of Health Affairs at the Defense Department, who oversees the initiative.
In response to questions from the Times, both the Army and Marine Corps acknowledged that some gun crew members were injured by blasts during the fight against the Islamic State. In part because of that experience, the branches say they now have programs to track and limit crewsâ exposure.
But a Marine officer currently in charge of an artillery battery questioned whether that was accurate. He said recently that he has never seen or heard of the new safety guidelines and that nothing was being done to document his troopsâ blast exposure.
The officer, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said he was experiencing splitting headaches and small seizures but was worried that his injuries would not be acknowledged because there was no documentation that he was ever exposed to anything dangerous.
In short, he said, there is little in military regulations now that might stop what happened to the artillery troops in Syria and Iraq from happening again.
A secret task force
Paradoxically, the point of sending artillery batteries to Syria was to avoid U.S. casualties.
Islamic State fighters overran vast swaths of Syria and Iraq in 2014, taking over some of the regionâs largest cities and using their self-proclaimed caliphate to organize attacks on civilian targets across the region and beyond. U.S. military planners knew they needed to confront the Islamic State but also knew that the American public was weary of long wars in the Middle East.
Artillery offered a lot of bang with hardly any U.S. boots on the ground. A battery with four howitzers and about 100 troops could deliver a torrent of fire, day or night, in any weather. But keeping the troop count to a bare minimum meant there would be no relief shifts. Each battery would have to do the work of many.
âThe people running this war made a choice,â said Lt. Col. Jonathan OâGorman, a Marine officer who oversaw artillery operations in the offensive and now teaches strategy at the U.S. Naval War College, âand choices have consequences.â
Alpha battery troops set up their big guns in March 2017 in a dirt field in Syria within sight of the enemy-controlled city of Raqqa and almost immediately started firing. They rarely stopped for the next two months.
Night and day, they hurled rounds, using some of the militaryâs most sophisticated cannons: M777A2 howitzers. The 35-foot-long guns had modern, precisely designed titanium parts and a digital targeting system, but when it came to protecting the crew, the design had changed little in a century. Gun crews still worked within armâs reach of the barrel and fired the gun by pulling a simple cord.
The resulting blast was several times louder than a jet taking off and unleashed a shock wave that hit the crews like a kick to the chest. Ears rang, bones shivered, vision blurred as eyeballs momentarily compressed, and a ripple shot through every neuron in the brain like a whipcrack.
âYou feel it in your core. You feel it in your teeth,â said Carson Brown, a corporal from Idaho who pulled the firing cord for hundreds of shots. âItâs like it takes a year off your life.â
The relentless firing was being driven by a small, top-secret Army Delta Force group called Task Force 9. President Donald Trump had given the task force broad authority to use heavy firepower, and the task force applied it with savage enthusiasm, often bending the rules to hit not just enemy positions but also mosques, schools, dams and power plants.
Sometimes, artillery crew members said, the task force ordered them to fire in a grid pattern, not aiming at any specific target but simply hurling rounds toward Raqqa to keep the enemy on edge.
The militaryâs Central Command, which oversaw the task force, did not respond to requests for comment.
The demands of Task Force 9 led to rates of artillery fire not seen in generations.
During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, artillery crews fired an average of 70 rounds during the entire six-week campaign, said John Grenier, a historian at the Armyâs Field Artillery School. During the initial months of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, crews fired an average of 260 rounds. In Syria, each gun in Alpha battery shot more than 1,100 rounds in two months â most of them using high-powered charges that produce the strongest shock waves. Some guns in Fox battery, which replaced Alpha, fired about 10,000 rounds each.
âItâs shocking, insane,â Grenier said.
Under the relentless tempo, Marines would wake up feeling hung over and stagger to the guns like zombies. Their sense of taste changed. Some threw up. Crews grew irritable, and fights broke out.
The symptoms were telltale signs of concussion but also what anyone might feel after a string of stressful 20-hour workdays in the desert, sleeping in foxholes and eating rations from plastic pouches. Medics came around daily to check on the crews but never intervened. And Marines trained to endure didnât complain.
A 20-year-old Marine from Missouri named Brandon Mooney was doing maintenance on his gun when he began to realize that he could no longer figure out how to put the pieces back together.
âIt got to a point where you knew the firing was affecting you, but what could you do? Refuse to do the mission?â he said in an interview.
When he returned home, screening tests said he was fine, but he was tormented by anxiety, sleep paralysis and hallucinations of a black demon standing over his bed.
After he left the Marine Corps, he became depressed and suicidal. He went to a veteransâ hospital for help. Although he never experienced anything he considered particularly traumatic in Syria, his nightmares and anxiety were diagnosed as PTSD.
âFrom what, though?â he said in the interview. âI could never understand it.â
Searching for answers
In the spring of 2017, two months after coming home from firing thousands of rounds in Iraq, Sgt. 1st Class Tyler Chatfield went missing in Kentucky.
He was a senior soldier in Charlie Battery of the Armyâs 1st Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment. The battery had fired a stunning number of rounds against the Islamic State and then returned to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in February 2017, just as the Marines were deploying.
At Fort Campbell, soldiers were struggling to sleep and were stalked by hard-edged anxiety that sometimes veered into panic.
Everyone was screened for PTSD and brain injury. The tests showed nothing unusual.
Iraq was Chatfieldâs third deployment, and his wife knew that homecomings could be rough, but this one seemed OK. He was relaxed, loving, engaged. He was coaching Little League and building a chicken coop in the backyard.
Then one morning, he was at the gym, and his heart started racing like a jackrabbit. Cold sweat poured down his neck, and he started to vomit. He was sure he was having a heart attack. He was 26 years old.
His wife took him to the hospital, but other than some inflammation, cardiologists found nothing wrong. He went home and a few days later had another attack.
Maybe itâs anxiety, a doctor suggested; he prescribed Xanax.
Traumatic brain injuries can have profound effects on parts of the body that are nowhere near the skull, because the damage can cause communication with other organs to malfunction. Dozens of the young veterans interviewed by the Times said they now had elevated, irregular heartbeats and persistent, painful problems with their digestion.
Chatfield never thought to mention the blasts he had endured to the doctors, his wife said. And the doctors didnât ask.
The next few days for the sergeant were quiet. He took his pills and rested. He roasted marshmallows in the backyard with his boys.
Then he was gone. He wasnât in bed when his wife woke up on the Thursday morning after the attack. He wasnât at work, either. The Army and local police went out looking for him.
His wife was sure he would show up to coach his sonsâ afternoon baseball game. But in the ninth inning, she was still scanning the parking lot.
She felt so uneasy by the end of the game that she asked another soldier to escort her home. The soldier went into the house first and emerged a few minutes later shaking his head. He had found Chatfieldâs body in the garage, behind a stack of boxes. The sergeant had taken his own life.
He left a short goodbye text but said nothing that shed light on his decision. The Army investigated but didnât uncover anything that his wife, Janaeâ Chatfield, felt could explain it.
âNone of it made any sense,â she said in an interview. âI donât know why it happened. I donât think I ever will.â
All four of the artillery batteries examined by the Times have had at least one suicide â a striking pattern, since death by suicide is rare even in high-risk populations. Some batteries have had several, and many service members said in interviews that they had tried to kill themselves.
A friend of Chatfieldâs, Staff Sgt. Joshua James, changed from an easygoing young father into an alcoholic, afflicted by anxiety and headaches.
He seemed to grow worse every year. In 2021, an MRI detected an abnormality deep in his brain, but doctors said they were not sure what caused it or what could be done. In November 2022, he was on a road trip with his family when he got into an argument with his wife. With no warning, he shot himself in the drive-thru of a fast-food restaurant.
âThe man who deployed never really came back,â Lindsey James, the sergeantâs wife, said in an interview at her home in Tennessee. âHe was a different person. He never understood what was happening to him. I donât think the Army did, either.â
Damage at a nano scale
The Defense Department has spent more than $1 billion in the past decade to research traumatic brain injury, but it still knows very little about what might have happened to the artillery crews. Nearly all of the research has focused on big explosions from roadside bombs and other enemy attacks, not the blast waves from the routine firing of weapons.
Still, as that research progressed and studies tried to define the threshold at which an explosion caused brain damage, a growing amount of data suggested that the level was much lower than expected â so low, in fact, that it wasnât much different from what troops experienced when they pulled the cord on an artillery cannon.
In 2016, while the U.S. military was exposing gun crews in Iraq and Syria to repeated artillery blasts, a research team was doing something similar to lab mice at the University of Missouri.
In a series of tests, the team placed mice a few feet from a lump of C4 explosive that was sized to produce a blast just above the militaryâs official safety level.
After the blast, the mice were returned to their cages and started scampering around, apparently unaffected.
âWe were very disappointed. We didnât see anything abnormal,â said Dr. Zezong Gu, who led the research.
But the picture changed over the next few days. Mice instinctively build nests, and researchers use the quality of their nests as a bench mark of well-being. The blasted mice built only ramshackle nests, often leaving them unfinished.
In later experiments, blasted mice were put through mazes. They made more wrong turns than healthy mice and sometimes froze, refusing to explore the mazes at all.
The team then dissected the animalsâ brains. At first, they found almost no damage.
âEverything looked fine until we looked at a nano scale,â Gu said.
Under an electron microscope, a ravaged neural landscape came into focus. Sheaths of myelin, vital for insulating the biological wiring of the brain, hung in tatters. In key parts of the brain that control emotion and executive function, large numbers of mitochondria â the tiny powerhouses that provide energy for each cell â were dead.
âIt was remarkable. The damage was very widespread,â Gu said. âAnd that was just from one explosion.â
Of course, the brains of mice and humans are very different. Dr. Scott Cota, a Navy captain and brain injury expert, said it was unclear whether the same damage would occur in human brains. Researchers canât expose humans to damaging blasts and then dissect them the way they can mice, he said. And techniques are not yet available to detect microscopic trauma in living brains.
âItâs very hard to study,â Cota said. âAnd unfortunately, we can only do it post-mortem at this point.â
âScared to deathâ
The artillery gun crews present a rare and valuable chance to understand how blasts affect the brain, but no researchers are tracking them. Itâs not clear if anyone in a position to learn from them is even aware that this unique group of combat veterans exists.
Most of the crew members have drifted out of the military to corners of the country where they continue to quietly grapple with headaches, depression and confusion that they donât understand.
Two soldiers who worked side by side on the same gun under James and Chatfield have failed to find stability, even years later.
Andrew Johnson, a tall, strong ammunition loader who stood right behind a cannon for thousands of shots, came home speaking with a noticeable delay, as if on a bad phone line. He was seeing flashes of light he couldnât explain. He grew suspicious of fellow soldiers and stayed isolated in his room. A year after coming home, he tried to overdose with sleeping pills.
âI canât even remember what I was dealing with,â Johnson said in an interview in Jackson, Mississippi, where he now lives. âI didnât drink, didnât smoke. I had a girlfriend. But I just couldnât function. I had this deep feeling of being all alone.â
The Army started him on therapy for depression and gave him pills to help with nightmares.
He was transferred to a new unit that knew nothing about his blast exposure in Iraq. He acquired a reputation for being unstable and was reprimanded for saying inappropriate things to other soldiers and shoving a medic. Last year, the Army forced him out for misconduct and gave him an other-than-honorable discharge.
He got a string of jobs but lost them. He tried to go to school twice and failed. He went to a veteransâ hospital seeking help but was turned away because his discharge banned him from receiving care there.
He is now homeless and sleeps in his car. Recently, he said, he attempted suicide again.
Earlier this year, he started seeing things. Shadows cast by streetlights seemed to be crawling. At first, there were transient flickers of motion on the edge of his vision. Then came full hallucinations of creatures moving through the darkness.
âNow they are very close, like at armâs length, and very real,â he said in a phone call from his car one night. âHonestly, I see it right now, and itâs freaking me out.â
Alex Sabol loaded charges right next to Johnson in Iraq. He had many advantages that Johnson never did. He was honorably discharged and given a monthly veteransâ pension. His family pays for a private psychotherapist. Even so, he has struggled.
After the deployment, he felt as if his moods had gone feral. The Army gave him a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, attention-deficit disorder and PTSD.
âMy friends, my family, I donât think they understood why I couldnât hold it together,â he said in an interview.
He is now in college. He tries to eat well and exercise. On a spring morning, a pair of rock-climbing shoes hung by the door of the light-filled cabin where he lives in the Appalachian Mountains.
But he has terrifying mood swings. Last year, he started punching himself. In autumn, he found himself in tears in his kitchen, in a pushup position hovering over a butcher knife, unsure why he had an overwhelming urge to plunge it into his heart.
He is trying to move on from Iraq, but a lurking darkness keeps pulling him off course.
This spring, he tried to hang himself. His girlfriend cut him down. She has since moved out.
âIâm scared to death,â he said in an interview at his cabin. âI donât want to die. And I donât get why I get into those horrible places.â

Duane âKeffe Dâ Davis made a brief court appearance in shackles Tuesday and spoke quietly with two court-appointed attorneys who were named to his case before he pleaded not guilty last Thursday.
Davis remains jailed in Las Vegas.
His public defenders, Charles Cano and Robert Arroyo, said they intend to file documents seeking his release on bail ahead of trial. The attorneys declined outside court to comment about the case, saying they have not yet had time to examine what prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo termed âvoluminousâ evidence.
Davis, 60, is originally from Compton, California. He was arrested Sept. 29 outside a Las Vegas-area home where police served a search warrant July 17.
Davis said publicly in recent years and in a 2019 tell-all memoir that he orchestrated the drive-by shooting that killed Shakur and wounded rap music mogul Marion âSugeâ Knight.
Knight, now 58, is serving 28 years in a California prison for the death of a Compton businessman in 2015.
Davis is the only person still alive who was in the vehicle from which shots were fired. He has said he has been diagnosed with cancer. Cano declined Tuesday to comment about his client’s health.
Prosecutors allege the 1996 shooting followed clashes between rival East Coast and West Coast groups for dominance in the musical genre dubbed âgangsta rap.” The grand jury was told that Shakur was involved in a brawl at a Las Vegas Strip casino with Davisâ nephew, Orlando âBaby Laneâ Anderson, shortly before the shooting.
Anderson, then 22, was in the car with Davis but denied involvement in Shakurâs killing. Anderson died two years later in a shooting in Compton.
Davis implicated himself during multiple interviews and in his memoir that described his life leading a Crips gang sect in Compton.
He wrote that he was promised immunity from prosecution in 2010 when he told authorities in Los Angeles what he knew about the fatal shootings of Shakur and rival rapper Christopher Wallace six months later in Los Angeles. Wallace was known as The Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls.
Shakur died at age 25. He had five No. 1 albums, was nominated for six Grammy Awards and was inducted in 2017 into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He received a posthumous star this year on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
A street near where Shakur lived in Oakland, California, in the 1990s was renamed last Friday in his honor.",N
Nashville investigating after possible leak of Covenant shooting images,2023-11-06,2023-11-07T07:21:07Z,en,seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/nashville-investigating-after-possible-leak-of-covenant-shooting-images/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107072107id_/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/nashville-investigating-after-possible-leak-of-covenant-shooting-images/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107072107/https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/nashville-investigating-after-possible-leak-of-covenant-shooting-images/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcykvbmF0aW9uLXdvcmxkL25hdGlvbi9uYXNodmlsbGUtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGluZy1hZnRlci1wb3NzaWJsZS1sZWFrLW9mLWNvdmVuYW50LXNob290aW5nLWltYWdlcz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cnNzX2FsbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9cnNz,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Nashville mayor’s office called on the city’s legal team Monday to investigate the possible unauthorized release of the writings of the shooter who indiscriminately opened fire at the private Nashville school in March, killing three children and three adults before being fatally shot by police.
Mayor Freddie O’Connell issued the statement shortly after conservative radio host Steven Crowder released what he said were three images of Audrey Hale’s writings from the day of the shooting.
Metro Nashville Police Department said Monday the images were not “MNPD crime scene images” and that it was working with Nashville’s legal department in the investigation.
Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation declined to confirm the authentication.
Authorities have not disclosed any of Hale’s journals or writings that were collected after the March 27 shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings.
MNPD initially said they would release the documents, but only after an investigation was officially closed — which could have taken months. In response, groups seeking the documents filed a lawsuit arguing that since the suspect was dead, the records should be immediately released.
Police then reversed course, saying that because of the lawsuits they would await the direction of the court on whether to release Hale’s writings.
That lawsuit is ongoing.
“I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving,” O’Connell said.
Wally Dietz, Nashville’s law director, confirmed in a statement Monday that he was launching the investigation, but said he could not immediately confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents due to the limited information surrounding the “possible leak.”
The Associated Press also has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents released Monday. The AP is one of several groups that have requested the writings but is not involved in the lawsuit to obtain them.
Attorneys representing families with the Covenant School have repeatedly said they have not seen Hale’s writings.
Brent Leatherwood, whose three children attend Covenant School, challenged Crowder and anyone who would amplify the images online to “just be a human for once,” and stop seeking clicks or platform building. Talking to reporters, Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks.
“How many people have to be killed in a senseless way so that you can get clicks?” he said.
Leatherwood said he received phone calls from parents today upset and worried to even look online at the images: “The damage done today is already significant, and I’m afraid it’s only going to grow.”
In May, a chancery court judge ruled that a group of more than 100 Covenant families could intervene in the case. The families say they do not want the police records to be made public, arguing the records will only cause more pain and possibly spark copycats.
An appeals court is now weighing whether that judge acted within the law.
Police have said Hale had been planning the massacre for months. Hale fired 152 rounds during the attack before being killed by police. Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder,” police said. However, authorities haven’t disclosed a link between that care and the shooting.
The Covenant case is further complicated by the fact that Hale, who was assigned female at birth, seems to have begun identifying as a transgender man – prompting right-wing commentators, politicians and other figures to share false claims of a rise in transgender mass shooters and to suggest that the fight for trans rights is radicalizing people.
Authorities’ refusal to release Hale’s writings has fueled further speculation and conspiracy theories about what they might reveal about Hale’s motive or influences.
The three children who were killed in the shooting were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. The three adults were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, custodian Mike Hill, 61, and 61-year-old substitute teacher Cynthia Peak. ___
