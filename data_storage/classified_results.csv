"Berkeley police release video, details in deadly domestic violence shooting at car dealership",2023-11-03,2023-11-04T02:28:17Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/toyota-of-berkeley-albany-police-shooting-domestic-violence-killing-video-identities-released/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104022817id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/toyota-of-berkeley-albany-police-shooting-domestic-violence-killing-video-identities-released/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104022817/https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/toyota-of-berkeley-albany-police-shooting-domestic-violence-killing-video-identities-released/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3RveW90YS1vZi1iZXJrZWxleS1hbGJhbnktcG9saWNlLXNob290aW5nLWRvbWVzdGljLXZpb2xlbmNlLWtpbGxpbmctdmlkZW8taWRlbnRpdGllcy1yZWxlYXNlZA~~,"Berkeley police release video, details in deadly domestic violence shooting at car dealership
BERKELEY – Authorities released additional details, including video, in connection with a domestic violence shooting that left a woman and the suspect dead at an East Bay car dealership in September.
On the morning of September 21, police were called to the Toyota of Berkeley service center located on Eastshore Highway in Albany around 11:15 a.m. on reports of an active shooter. Both officers from Berkeley and Albany responded.
In an update on Friday, Berkeley Police released surveillance and body camera video of the incident. Due to its graphic nature, viewer discretion is advised.
Police spokesperson Jessica Perry said in the video that 24-year-old Lamar Walker of Vacaville entered the building and shot 24-year-old Alonna Gallon, an employee at the dealership.
Security footage obtained by police showed Walker approach Gallon, who was sitting at her desk, and shoot her at point-blank range. He then turned the gun on himself in a suicide attempt, police said.
After officers directed employees out of the dealership, they learned that the victim and the shooter were in the second floor of the building. Once determining that there was no active gunfire, officers then searched the property.
When police reached the second floor, body-worn camera video along with surveillance video showed Walker pointing a gun at officers. Police said in a statement Friday that five officers discharged their firearms in response, striking Walker.
Officers found Gallon deceased from an apparent gunshot wound on the floor next to Walker. Emergency responders provided first aid but both people were pronounced dead at the scene.
At the time of the shooting, witnesses said the victim and shooter knew each other. The Alameda County Sheriff's Office determined that the incident was an act of domestic violence and that they were in a relationship.
""What we know right now for certain that this was not a random crime,"" Perry said in the video released by the department on Friday. ""Ms. Gallon's death was a senseless act of violence that left a young boy without his mother, a child she was co-parenting with Mr. Walker.""
Police said the incident remains under investigation by the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, the Albany Police Department and the Alameda County District Attorney's Office Officer-Involved Shooting Team. A parallel internal investigation by the Berkeley Police Department is also ongoing.

Murder Victim’s Daughter Helps Clear Brooklyn Man Convicted in Killing,2023-11-03,2023-11-04T03:38:55Z,en,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/nyregion/brooklyn-man-exonerated.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104033855id_/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/nyregion/brooklyn-man-exonerated.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104033855/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/nyregion/brooklyn-man-exonerated.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55dGltZXMpLzIwMjMvMTEvMDMvbnlyZWdpb24vYnJvb2tseW4tbWFuLWV4b25lcmF0ZWQuaHRtbA~~,"Supported by
Murder Victim’s Daughter Helps Clear Brooklyn Man Convicted in Killing
Prosecutors said they reviewed a 1982 case at the urging of the victim’s daughter, who became convinced the wrong man was convicted of her father’s killing.
In December 1982, four armed men burst into a bodega in Brooklyn serving as a front for marijuana dealing and ordered two men working inside to hand over drugs.
The men then shot the clerks, killing one of them, Jairam Gangaram, a 32-year-old father of four girls. The other clerk, Edward McClean, was shot in the stomach but survived.
Five years later, a jury convicted Detroy Livingston of second degree murder following the testimony of a troubled young woman with an addiction to crack cocaine who claimed to be at the scene. Mr. Livingston, who had rejected a plea deal that would have set him free within 12 years, was sentenced to 25 years to life. He spent 35 years in prison and never stopped insisting he was innocent.
On Friday, prosecutors from the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, agreed that Mr. Livingston’s conviction should be vacated and the charges against him dismissed. They had come to that decision after an unusual request from one of Mr. Gangaram’s daughters, Karen Dannett, who began researching the case in 2000. She was 10 years old when her father died.
Ms. Dannett said she began collecting every document she could find about the killing, hoping her research would bring her a sense of solace. Instead, she was horrified to discover the thinness of the evidence in the case and began to fear the wrong man had been imprisoned.
On Friday morning, Ms. Dannett, 51, who lives in Georgia, appeared on a live screen in Brooklyn Supreme Court, where Judge Matthew D’Emic agreed to dismiss the case against Mr. Livingston.
“I’m sorry he suffered so long,” Ms. Dannett said. “I can only pray his later days are better days.”
Mr. Livingston, 59, who was paroled in 2021, said he was relieved and grateful to have his record cleared of the conviction.
“I knew it would come,” he said.
Mr. Livingston’s case was the 36th one vacated since 2014 by the conviction review unit, a team of prosecutors within the Brooklyn district attorney’s office tasked with examining convictions. The unit has reopened about 40 other potentially mishandled cases — the vast majority of them murder convictions.
Charles Linehan, chief of the review unit, told Judge D’Emic that the case against Mr. Livingston had rested on the word of Tracey Evans, 19 years old at the time, who made numerous conflicting statements to the police and did not tell investigators about her drug addiction, which had affected her memory.
Prosecutors in the review unit analyzed the witness statements and found that the case was “irreparably flawed” with “glaring discrepancies” and “critical failures,” Mr. Linehan said.
“Almost 35 years later we don’t have any confidence in the integrity of the conviction,” he said.
In 1982, the detectives working on the case heard from Ms. Evans less than two weeks after the murder. She said she had seen three men shoot a man inside the bodega and identified them, though she did not name Mr. Livingston.
One of the men she identified, Dwayne Cook, later pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree in exchange for a three- to nine-year sentence if he testified against Mr. Livingston. Mr. Cook later reneged and did not testify. None of the other men Ms. Evans identified were charged with the shootings.
The surviving clerk, Mr. McLean, told the police he never got a clear look at the shooter, who wore a stocking over his face.
Over the next four years, Ms. Evans repeatedly changed her story. In one version, she identified Mr. Livingston, whom she said she met through Mr. Cook, as one of four men who had gone inside the bodega. In July 1986, Mr. Livingston was arrested.
Mr. Livingston, who claimed he had not heard about the killing until he was charged with it, said he did not know Ms. Evans and doubted he had ever stepped inside the bodega.
“I don’t know nothing about this,” Mr. Livingston said at his sentencing in 1987. “They found me guilty, and I can’t say nothing else.”
Ms. Dannett said that for years after Mr. Gangaram’s death, his mother remained haunted by the case and cried constantly.
In either 2012 or 2013, Ms. Dannett said, she sent a letter to Mr. Livingston and waited for his reply, worrying he would be “embittered and angry.”
Instead, he wrote back, expressing optimism and gratitude for her willingness to question the case.
“He always had a positive attitude,” Ms. Dannett said. “His motto was: ‘I’m in it to win it.’”
After the hearing, Mr. Livingston waved at Ms. Dannett, who looked back at him with tears in her eyes.
When he stepped out in the hallway, a woman approached and asked if he had just been exonerated.
She was there to support her husband, she said, who was seeking to overturn his own conviction.
“Don’t give up,” Mr. Livingston said.
An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Karen Dannett wrote a letter to Detroy Livingston. It was either 2012 or 2013, not 2007.

President Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited Lewiston, Maine, on Friday to mourn the deaths of 18 people killed last week in the state's deadliest mass shooting in history.
The president delivered remarks to pay his respects to the victims, after meeting with first responders, nurses and other community members. The president will meet privately with families of the victims. In his remarks, the president did not call on Congress to pass specific gun control measures.
""You know as we mourn today in Maine, this tragedy opens a painful, painful wounds all across the country,"" the president said. ""Too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence. I know because Jill and I have met with them in Buffalo, in Uvalde, in Monterey Park, and Sandy Hook ... too many to count. Too many to count. From places that never made the news all across America.""
In addition to those who lost their lives in Maine, 13 people were injured last week when a gunman opened fire at a bar and a bowling alley. The shooter was found dead after a two-day manhunt.
After the mass shooting, Mr. Biden ordered the flags at the White House and federal buildings to fly at half staff and said in a statement, ""Far too many Americans have now had a family member killed or injured as a result of gun violence. That is not normal, and we cannot accept it.""
Biden meets with victims and families
The president and first lady are meeting with people who survived last week's attack, as well as many of the families who lost loved ones.
The meetings are closed to the press.
Biden says victims ""lived lives of love and service and sacrifice""
The president lamented the loss of life in the mass shooting. ""Eighteen precious souls stolen. Thirteen wounded,"" he said. ""...All of them lived lives of love and service and sacrifice.""
Mr. Biden also called attention to the survivors of the shooting.
""We also remember the survivors who will forever carry the memories and the physical and emotional scars of this,"" he said.
The president said that ""too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence.""
""Regardless of our politics, this is about protecting our freedom to go to a bowling alley, a restaurant a school, a church — without being shot and killed,"" the president said.
""Scripture says the Lord is near to the broken-hearted and saves the crushed in spirit — and saves the crushed in spirit,"" the president said. ""Our prayer is that the crushed in spirit survive this more rapidly than otherwise.""
The president did not call on Congress to pass specific gun control measures.
Biden meets first responders at bowling alley
The president and first lady are at Just-In-Time Recreation, the bowling alley where the gunman shot several people.
They're meeting with first responders and nurses who tended to the victims, as well as community leaders.
""The president and the first lady are meeting with first responders, including paramedics, health care providers, nurses, firefighters, and other law enforcement officials on the front lines of the response,"" the White House said.
Along the route from the bar to the bowling alley, onlookers lined the streets to watch the president's motorcade.
Biden visits memorial at shooting site
President Biden and the first lady made a stop at Schemengees Bar & Grille, one of the locations of the mass shooting, where a memorial has been set up in honor of the victims.
Mr. Biden placed a bouquet of flowers at the memorial, and he and the first lady observed the memorial in a moment of silence.
Flowers, carved pumpkins and signs mark the site.
""I am at a loss for words,"" Schemengees wrote on Facebook last week. ""In a split second your world gets turn upside down for no good reason. We loss great people in this community. How can we make any sense of this. Sending out prayers to everyone.""
Biden arrives in Maine
President Biden has landed in Maine. Several members of the state's congressional delegation are traveling with him — Republican Sen. Susan Collins and independent Sen. Angus King, as well as Rep. Chellie Pingree. First lady Jill Biden greeted them at the airport — she arrived separately from New York.
Maine's yellow-flag law
Law enforcement and gunman Robert Card's Army Reserve unit received warnings about his mental health and the threat he might pose in the months leading up to the shooting.
Three months before the mass shooting, Army Reserve unit leaders said he was ""behaving erratically,"" and the Army decided he shouldn't have a weapon, handle ammunition or ""participate in live fire activity,"" according to an Army spokesperson.
And according to a statement by Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry, his office was contacted in May by members of Card's family, who were concerned about his mental health and access to weapons. Merry said a deputy within his office contacted the reservist's Army Reserve training group, ""who assured our office that they would ensure that (he) received medical attention.""
Maine has a law on the books intended to deal with potentially dangerous individuals with firearms, a ""yellow-flag law."" Many states have red-flag laws, which enable family members or roommates of gun owners who they suspect may pose an immediate violent threat to seek an emergency court order forcing them to temporarily give up their firearms, though the gun owners may appeal the order.
Maine's yellow-flag law — the only one of its kind in the country, CBS News Boston notes — has a few more steps. Anyone who suspects a gun owner is an imminent threat, whether that's a close relative or a police officer, may report the gun owner to the police. It then falls to local law enforcement to take the individual into protective custody, order a mental health evaluation from a medical expert, and if the doctor and police deem necessary, apply for a court order to temporarily take possession of any firearms.
CBS News Boston points out that in Card's case, many people close to him called law enforcement at the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office. But the sheriff's office never took the next step — bringing Card into protective custody and going through the state's yellow-flag law.
Biden continues to call for an assault weapons ban
Despite opposition from congressional Republicans, the president has repeatedly pushed for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
""It is within our power to once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to require safe storage of guns, to end gun manufacturers' immunity from liability, and to enact universal background checks,"" Mr. Biden said in July after deadly shootings in Philadelphia, Fort Worth, Texas, Baltimore and Chicago.
But successful action in Congress on those fronts is unlikely. Republicans control the House, and Democrats only narrowly control the Senate.
Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who represents Lewiston in Congress, previously opposed gun control measures but reversed his stance last week and is now calling for an assault weapons ban.
Last year, Congress passed additional gun control measures with some bipartisan support, its first major gun legislation in three decades. But the president continues to insist that's insufficient.
A time for Biden to ""be with Americans who are in mourning,"" says White House press secretary
""Too many times, the president and the first Lady have traveled to communities completely torn apart by gun violence,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday. ""As the president said last week, this is not normal, and we can't accept it as normal. So, while Friday will be a solemn day and a time for the president to be with Americans who are in mourning, he will also continue to demand that Congress act.""
Mr. Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited Uvalde, Texas, in May 2022, after a deadly mass shooting at an elementary school. Days before that, they visited a memorial site in Buffalo, New York, where 10 people lost their lives in a racially motivated shooting.",N

Remembering Food’s Punk-Rock Moment and More: The Week in Reporter Reads
Articles from around The Times, narrated just for you.
This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them.
The Real End of David Chang’s Momofuku Ko Happened Years Ago
Written and narrated by Pete Wells
David Chang is “pausing operations” at Momofuku Ko, according to a post on his company’s Instagram account. It goes on: “we won’t call this a goodbye, but ko will no longer operate in the way it has.”
Just what that means is unclear, but it sure sounds like some kind of a goodbye given that about three weeks ago Mr. Chang turned out the lights for good at Momofuku Ssam Bar. The strange thing about both announcements is how muted the response has been. Maybe the sheer number of restaurants that have gone under since the pandemic began has made us numb to this sort of news.
The reaction would have been different — louder and more apocalyptic — 10 or 15 years ago. Back then, a change in Ko’s no-cameras policy or Ssam Bar’s doomed Korean-burrito menu would light up the food blogs, whose reporters used to chase scraps of Momofuku news like Woodward and Bernstein. If you weren’t living and eating out in New York then, it’s hard to imagine what the early days of those restaurants were like, especially Ko.
Pete Wells looks back at Momofuku Ko, which once was food’s punk-rock moment and ultimately ended up with almost every one of the fine-dining trappings it had rejected, up to and including high prices.

How Music Can Be Mental Health Care
Written and narrated by Christina Caron
The therapy session begins when Isobell, 17, picks up a guitar.
Her fingers, adorned with silver rings and black nail polish, are positioned to play the first chord of Lana Del Rey’s “Candy Necklace.”
Isobell’s therapist, Caitlin Bell, accompanies her on the piano.
Although they are actually sitting in a medical clinic — the Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine at Mount Sinai-Union Square in Manhattan — the space feels more like a musician’s living room, with sheet music on display and wooden bookcases that line the walls, each housing different instruments.
Music therapy, while still a relatively small field, has grown over the last decade. The practice helps people cope with ailments as wide ranging as stress, chronic pain, limited mobility and hypertension, and is performed in a variety of settings, including psychiatric hospitals, outpatient clinics, senior centers and schools.

How Posters of Kidnapped Israelis Ignited a Firestorm on American Sidewalks
Written and narrated by Katherine Rosman
“KIDNAPPED,” the posters say, in big block letters above pictures of people taken hostage by Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel, urgent reminders of the men, women and children still being held hostage in Gaza.
In the weeks since the war in the Middle East started, the “kidnapped” posters, created by Israeli street artists, have grown ubiquitous, papering public spaces across the United States, Western Europe and beyond. Available to anyone with an internet connection, they can be printed out and pasted onto lampposts, boarded-up storefronts and subway entrances.
But removing the posters has quickly emerged as its own form of protest — a release valve and also a provocation by those anguished by what they say was the Israeli government’s mistreatment of Palestinians in the years before Oct. 7 and since the bombing of Gaza began.

The Signs Were All There. Why Did No One Stop the Maine Shooter?
Written by Shaila Dewan, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Chelsia Rose Marcius | Narrated by Shaila Dewan
Robert Card displayed a textbook set of warning signs: He was hearing voices. He told people that he was planning violence. And his behavior had markedly changed in the months leading up to the mass shooting he carried out last week.
His family, his superiors in the military and the local police knew all of this. Yet no one stopped him.
His killing of 18 people with an assault-style rifle in Lewiston, Maine, points to how shortcomings in the mental health system, weak laws and a reluctance to threaten personal liberties can derail even concerted attempts to thwart violence in a country awash in guns.

Where Israelis, Palestinians and Iranians Must Listen to One Another
Written and narrated by Javier C. Hernández
The young musicians, in jeans and fuzzy sweaters, had just finished rehearsing a Prokofiev symphony in an empty concert hall. Then they put away their instruments and settled back into their orchestra chairs to talk about the war.
It was a recent afternoon at the Barenboim-Said Academy, a sleekly modern music conservatory in Berlin founded by the renowned Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim with the intention of bringing together students from across the Middle East, and the musicians were wrestling with the Israel-Hamas conflict and their raw emotions.
An Israeli music student described the trauma of the Hamas attacks. A Palestinian spoke of feeling voiceless and vulnerable. An Iranian described fears that violence could spread across the entire region.
“It takes courage for you to be here,” Mr. Barenboim, 80, who has worked almost 25 years in pursuit of the elusive goal of Middle East peace, said from the podium. “We have to listen to each other,” he declared, giving voice to what might be the academy’s unofficial credo, both for music-making and politics.

Biden Mourns With Lewiston After Mass Shooting: ‘You’re Not Alone’,2023-11-03,2023-11-04T04:40:34Z,en,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/us/politics/biden-lewiston-maine-shooting.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104044034id_/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/us/politics/biden-lewiston-maine-shooting.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104044034/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/us/politics/biden-lewiston-maine-shooting.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55dGltZXMpLzIwMjMvMTEvMDMvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvYmlkZW4tbGV3aXN0b24tbWFpbmUtc2hvb3RpbmcuaHRtbA~~,"Supported by
Biden Mourns With Lewiston After Mass Shooting: ‘You’re Not Alone’
President Biden met with the families of those killed or injured during last month’s rampage in Maine, which killed 18 people.
Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reported from Lewiston, Maine, and Michael D. Shear reported from Washington.
Since taking office, President Biden has traveled a grim path through American communities desperately grieving in the wake of mass shootings: Uvalde, Texas; Monterey Park, Calif.; Buffalo; Atlanta.
On Friday, he added another to the list: Lewiston, Maine.
Mr. Biden huddled privately with the families of those killed or injured during last month’s rampage that claimed the lives of 18 people at a bar and a bowling alley in the city about an hour north of Portland. He also met with nurses, local officials and the law enforcement officers who spent two days in a manhunt for the killer.
“Jill and I are here on behalf of the American people to grieve with you, and make sure you know that you’re not alone,” Mr. Biden said after stopping by a makeshift memorial in Lewiston with his wife, Jill Biden.
It is the sad reality of the modern presidency that the occupant of the Oval Office is often called upon to channel the country’s sorrow and to directly console those whose lives have been shattered. For Mr. Biden, whose own life has been shaped by grief, it is a role he embraces as a necessary part of healing.
The president’s brief visit was not, White House officials acknowledged, a moment for Mr. Biden to begin a forceful new push for gun control measures. In his remarks, which lasted just over four minutes, he did not repeat his call for a ban on assault weapons, universal background checks and other legislation that both parties in Congress agree have no chance of passing among polarized lawmakers.
Instead, the president used the opportunity to urge Americans to seek consensus more broadly in the hopes of avoiding more of the spasms of deadly violence that have become a routine part of life in the United States.
“This is about common sense,” he said. “Reasonable, responsible measures to protect our children, our families, our communities. Because regardless of our politics, this is about protecting our freedom to go to a bowling alley, restaurant, school, church without being shot and killed.”
Shortly after the massacre, Mr. Biden declared his frustration at yet another mass shooting. The gunman, Robert R. Card II, 40, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Friday night, two days after the killings.
“Once again, an American community and American families have been devastated by gun violence,” Mr. Biden said in the remarks last month. “In all, at least 18 souls brutally slain, more injured, some critically, and scores of family and friends praying and experiencing trauma no one ever wants to imagine.”
The president’s arrival in Maine on Friday came as an investigation continued into Mr. Card’s motives and as law enforcement officials faced questions about why nothing was done to prevent Mr. Card’s rampage — even though officials at his Army Reserve unit and the local police knew for months of his deteriorating mental health.
Members of Mr. Card’s family first warned the Sheriff’s Office in Sagadahoc County, where Mr. Card lived, in May that he had collected roughly a dozen guns and was growing increasingly paranoid and angry. By that time, the Army Reserve was already aware of his decline, records show.
Then, in September, Army Reserve officials in Saco, Maine, asked the Sheriff’s Office to check on Mr. Card after he punched a friend and said he was going to carry out a shooting rampage at the Reserve base and elsewhere.
But despite those warnings, the Sheriff’s Office never made contact with Mr. Card, opting instead to trust that his family would be able to remove his guns. A little over a month later, he carried out the deadliest mass shooting of the year.
Maine has high rates of hunting and gun ownership and has stopped short of the “red flag” laws in other states that allow police to take guns from people who are found to be a danger to themselves or others.
Instead, Maine has a “yellow flag” law that requires the police to have a person evaluated by a medical practitioner and then go before a judge before the person’s firearms can be taken away.
Outside the Lewiston airport just before Mr. Biden landed, two neighbors with different politics were walking their dogs and thinking about how the shooting had upended the region, bringing their views on guns and mental illness to the front of their minds.
Diane Daskey said she had voted for former President Donald J. Trump but was glad that Mr. Biden was in town to pay his respects and meet with families of the victims.
“I didn’t vote for him, but I’m glad that he’s coming,” Ms. Daskey said. “We appreciate it as a community. This whole thing has torn us apart.”
She added that she still supported people’s right to own guns, but maybe not AR-15-style rifles.
Her neighbor, Karen Berube, a supporter of Mr. Biden’s, chimed in: “Not assault rifles. Absolutely not. We don’t need any assault rifles.”
Ms. Berube said the shooting had shaken Lewiston and the tight-knit communities around it.
“It’s terrifying and heartbreaking,” she said.

President Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited Lewiston, Maine, on Friday to mourn the deaths of 18 people killed last week in the state's deadliest mass shooting in history.
The president delivered remarks to pay his respects to the victims, after meeting with first responders, nurses and other community members. The president will meet privately with families of the victims. In his remarks, the president did not call on Congress to pass specific gun control measures.
""You know as we mourn today in Maine, this tragedy opens a painful, painful wounds all across the country,"" the president said. ""Too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence. I know because Jill and I have met with them in Buffalo, in Uvalde, in Monterey Park, and Sandy Hook ... too many to count. Too many to count. From places that never made the news all across America.""
In addition to those who lost their lives in Maine, 13 people were injured last week when a gunman opened fire at a bar and a bowling alley. The shooter was found dead after a two-day manhunt.
After the mass shooting, Mr. Biden ordered the flags at the White House and federal buildings to fly at half staff and said in a statement, ""Far too many Americans have now had a family member killed or injured as a result of gun violence. That is not normal, and we cannot accept it.""
Biden meets with victims and families
The president and first lady are meeting with people who survived last week's attack, as well as many of the families who lost loved ones.
The meetings are closed to the press.
Biden says victims ""lived lives of love and service and sacrifice""
The president lamented the loss of life in the mass shooting. ""Eighteen precious souls stolen. Thirteen wounded,"" he said. ""...All of them lived lives of love and service and sacrifice.""
Mr. Biden also called attention to the survivors of the shooting.
""We also remember the survivors who will forever carry the memories and the physical and emotional scars of this,"" he said.
The president said that ""too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence.""
""Regardless of our politics, this is about protecting our freedom to go to a bowling alley, a restaurant a school, a church — without being shot and killed,"" the president said.
""Scripture says the Lord is near to the broken-hearted and saves the crushed in spirit — and saves the crushed in spirit,"" the president said. ""Our prayer is that the crushed in spirit survive this more rapidly than otherwise.""
The president did not call on Congress to pass specific gun control measures.
Biden meets first responders at bowling alley
The president and first lady are at Just-In-Time Recreation, the bowling alley where the gunman shot several people.
They're meeting with first responders and nurses who tended to the victims, as well as community leaders.
""The president and the first lady are meeting with first responders, including paramedics, health care providers, nurses, firefighters, and other law enforcement officials on the front lines of the response,"" the White House said.
Along the route from the bar to the bowling alley, onlookers lined the streets to watch the president's motorcade.
Biden visits memorial at shooting site
President Biden and the first lady made a stop at Schemengees Bar & Grille, one of the locations of the mass shooting, where a memorial has been set up in honor of the victims.
Mr. Biden placed a bouquet of flowers at the memorial, and he and the first lady observed the memorial in a moment of silence.
Flowers, carved pumpkins and signs mark the site.
""I am at a loss for words,"" Schemengees wrote on Facebook last week. ""In a split second your world gets turn upside down for no good reason. We loss great people in this community. How can we make any sense of this. Sending out prayers to everyone.""
Biden arrives in Maine
President Biden has landed in Maine. Several members of the state's congressional delegation are traveling with him — Republican Sen. Susan Collins and independent Sen. Angus King, as well as Rep. Chellie Pingree. First lady Jill Biden greeted them at the airport — she arrived separately from New York.
Maine's yellow-flag law
Law enforcement and gunman Robert Card's Army Reserve unit received warnings about his mental health and the threat he might pose in the months leading up to the shooting.
Three months before the mass shooting, Army Reserve unit leaders said he was ""behaving erratically,"" and the Army decided he shouldn't have a weapon, handle ammunition or ""participate in live fire activity,"" according to an Army spokesperson.
And according to a statement by Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry, his office was contacted in May by members of Card's family, who were concerned about his mental health and access to weapons. Merry said a deputy within his office contacted the reservist's Army Reserve training group, ""who assured our office that they would ensure that (he) received medical attention.""
Maine has a law on the books intended to deal with potentially dangerous individuals with firearms, a ""yellow-flag law."" Many states have red-flag laws, which enable family members or roommates of gun owners who they suspect may pose an immediate violent threat to seek an emergency court order forcing them to temporarily give up their firearms, though the gun owners may appeal the order.
Maine's yellow-flag law — the only one of its kind in the country, CBS News Boston notes — has a few more steps. Anyone who suspects a gun owner is an imminent threat, whether that's a close relative or a police officer, may report the gun owner to the police. It then falls to local law enforcement to take the individual into protective custody, order a mental health evaluation from a medical expert, and if the doctor and police deem necessary, apply for a court order to temporarily take possession of any firearms.
CBS News Boston points out that in Card's case, many people close to him called law enforcement at the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office. But the sheriff's office never took the next step — bringing Card into protective custody and going through the state's yellow-flag law.
Biden continues to call for an assault weapons ban
Despite opposition from congressional Republicans, the president has repeatedly pushed for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
""It is within our power to once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to require safe storage of guns, to end gun manufacturers' immunity from liability, and to enact universal background checks,"" Mr. Biden said in July after deadly shootings in Philadelphia, Fort Worth, Texas, Baltimore and Chicago.
But successful action in Congress on those fronts is unlikely. Republicans control the House, and Democrats only narrowly control the Senate.
Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who represents Lewiston in Congress, previously opposed gun control measures but reversed his stance last week and is now calling for an assault weapons ban.
Last year, Congress passed additional gun control measures with some bipartisan support, its first major gun legislation in three decades. But the president continues to insist that's insufficient.
A time for Biden to ""be with Americans who are in mourning,"" says White House press secretary
""Too many times, the president and the first Lady have traveled to communities completely torn apart by gun violence,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday. ""As the president said last week, this is not normal, and we can't accept it as normal. So, while Friday will be a solemn day and a time for the president to be with Americans who are in mourning, he will also continue to demand that Congress act.""

A Kalamazoo County judge on Wednesday sentenced Nicholas Johnson to spend between 29 and 69 years in prison. The Portage man must serve a minimum of 29 years before he's eligible for parole, WWMT-TV reported.
Johnson pleaded no contest last month to two counts of second-degree murder in the February 2021 fatal shootings of his parents, Gary Johnson, 65, and Laura Johnson, 64. Authorities said they were slain at their home in Portage, about 55 miles south of Grand Rapids.

A medical examiner ruled their deaths homicide.
Relatives and friends who gave victim impact statements during Wednesday's sentencing mentioned Nicholas Johnsonâ€™s mental health issues and said his parents feared him.

TX sheriff’s office probed by FBI over corruption allegations,2023-11-03,2023-11-04T03:21:57Z,en,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/tx-sheriffs-office-probed-fbi-corruption-allegations,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104032157id_/https://www.foxnews.com/us/tx-sheriffs-office-probed-fbi-corruption-allegations,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104032157/https://www.foxnews.com/us/tx-sheriffs-office-probed-fbi-corruption-allegations,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGZveG5ld3MpL3VzL3R4LXNoZXJpZmZzLW9mZmljZS1wcm9iZWQtZmJpLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tYWxsZWdhdGlvbnM~,"The FBI is investigating a Texas sheriff who faced complaints of corruption from his own deputies for years before drawing broader scrutiny for his agency's response to a mass shooting, according to a woman interviewed by federal agents.
The woman said she's twice met with a pair of FBI agents in recent months after contacting them about what she feels was the sheriff's botched investigation of her brother's killing. Jenifer Jones told The Associated Press the agents gathered records accusing San Jacinto County Sheriff Greg Capers and his staff of wide-ranging misconduct and told her they were looking for potential civil rights violations. During hourslong interviews, Jones said they asked specific questions about cases and events well beyond her brother's death.
Federal investigators' interest in the rural sheriff comes after an AP investigation found longstanding accusations that Capers has ignored deputies' misconduct and neglected basic police work while pursuing asset seizures that boost his office's $3.5 million budget but don’t always hold up in court.
TEXAS SHERIFF WAS NEVER INVESTIGATED DESPITE YEARS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT CORRUPTION, ACCORDING TO DEPUTIES
TEXAS SHERIFF TELLS CONGRESS COUNTY 'UNDER SIEGE' AS DEPARTMENT SHARES MIGRANT SMUGGLING CASES
It’s unclear how far along the FBI investigation is or when it might be concluded. Many federal investigations never result in criminal charges. An FBI spokesperson said the agency neither confirms nor denies investigations.
Capers did not directly respond to calls seeking comment, but his second-in-command said they haven’t heard from agents and that their office is always open to outside scrutiny.
""I look forward to the visit, if they’ll show up here and ask the other half of the story,"" Chief Deputy Tim Kean said.
The probe follows years of complaints by the sheriff's staff to state and federal law enforcement. Capers gained prominence in May while leading the dayslong search for a man who fatally shot five neighbors in the county, which is an hour's drive from Houston. But he also drew criticism for initially providing inaccurate information about deputies' response time and from some residents who said they felt neglected by and even fear the sheriff.
The time agents spent with Jones shows they have ""a great deal of interest in information she’s providing,"" said Michelle Lee, a retired FBI agent in Texas. She noted that’s a strong indicator of an open investigation, but warned that such probes can go on under-the-radar for years.
Jones, 47, said she reached out to the FBI over the summer, hoping the scrutiny of Capers following the shooting would make it easier for her to draw attention to the sheriff's investigation into her brother's death.
TEXAS SHERIFF'S DEPUTY KILLED RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC FIGHT, SUSPECT ARRESTED
Jones' brother, John Wayne Dodge, was fatally shot in 2020 and sheriff's deputies arrested his son for murder. But in 2022 prosecutors dropped the case ""in the interest of justice,"" court records show. Jones believes another man is responsible for her brother's death and was never adequately investigated.
San Jacinto County District Attorney Todd Dillon said information about that man was also presented to a grand jury in 2020. Dillon said that he couldn't comment on another agency's investigation, but that after taking office last year he concluded there wasn't ""sufficient evidence or cause to proceed"" with the case against Dodge's son.
In September, Jones said she met with two FBI agents from Bryan, Texas. During the interview, she said they indicated there might not be much they could do about Dodge's case but asked for her help connecting them with people who may have been wronged by the sheriff.
Jones said she also gave the agents a copy of a police consultant’s report that compares the sheriff's office to organized crime. The county leaders who paid nearly $50,000 for the report last year disregarded its recommendation to ask the Texas Rangers’ public corruption squad to investigate Capers.
TEXAS SHERIFF OPENS CRIMINAL PROBE INTO DESANTIS OPERATION TO FLY MIGRANTS TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD
Agents would consider it a ""red flag"" that officials ignored the conclusion of a report they paid for, Lee said.
Jones provided the names and official email addresses of the agents she met with. A law enforcement official confirmed agents with those names work for the FBI in Bryan. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.
Jones said she met with them again in October, providing more records and contact information for other people who were interested in talking about the sheriff. She recalled one agent telling her they were looking for cases in which people's rights were violated.
Jones said she wants county residents to know there is an outside authority they can turn to with complaints about the sheriff.
""I feel like the victims of this county have nowhere else to go,"" she said.",N

Kris Chapman-Green, mother of Dakotah ""Kody"" Chapman-Green, joined ""FOX & Friends First"" on Friday with an update on her son's recovery, explaining that doctors and nurses have been ""shocked"" at his progress since the Oct. 24 attack.
Dashcam video showed the horrifying moment the state police officer was fired upon by a Chicago man last week near Springfield.
IL GUNMAN INJURES 15 IN LATE-NIGHT HALLOWEEN PARTY SHOOTING
On Oct. 24, just before 11:00 p.m., Chapman-Green stopped Cristobal Santana.
The video shows Santana get out of the vehicle during the stop and exchange gunfire with Chapman-Green. Police say Santana fired at least 10 shots and struck the officer several times.
Officials said Santana beat Chapman-Green, causing facial fractures, a skull fracture and a brain bleed.
Despite the vicious attack, Kris said her son is surprising doctors with his recovery so far, calling it a ""miracle.""
She said Kody is at a local hospital receiving inpatient rehab.
""All the doctors and the nurses are just totally shocked of how quickly he's recovering,"" said Kris, explaining that her son is now walking on crutches.
She said the incident, which was ""heartbreaking"" for her to watch on video, was a routine traffic stop and the suspect was concealing a gun ""underneath his leg.""
""[Dakotah] started backing up, as you see in the video. And then it just went from there.""
Santana was apprehended after being struck by a police car and charged with two counts of attempted murder in connection to the shooting, Fox 2 reported. A judge ordered Santana be held in the Sangamon County Jail once he is released from the hospital.
Santana is also suspected in the murder of his ex-girlfriend in Chicago.
Kris said her son wanted to be a state trooper since his early high school days and, even after the attack, still wants to be on the force.
""This is what he wanted to do and still wants to do,"" she said.

Anyone who suspects a gun owner is an imminent threat, whether that's a close relative or a police officer, may report the gun owner to the police. It then falls to local law enforcement to take the individual into protective custody, order a mental health evaluation from a medical expert, and if the doctor and police deem necessary, apply for a court order to temporarily take possession of any firearms.
CBS News Boston points out that in Card's case, many people close to him called law enforcement at the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office. But the sheriff's office never took the next step — bringing Card into protective custody and going through the state's yellow-flag law.
Biden continues to call for an assault weapons ban
Despite opposition from congressional Republicans, the president has repeatedly pushed for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
""It is within our power to once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to require safe storage of guns, to end gun manufacturers' immunity from liability, and to enact universal background checks,"" Mr. Biden said in July after deadly shootings in Philadelphia, Fort Worth, Texas, Baltimore and Chicago.
But successful action in Congress on those fronts is unlikely. Republicans control the House, and Democrats only narrowly control the Senate.
Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who represents Lewiston in Congress, previously opposed gun control measures but reversed his stance last week and is now calling for an assault weapons ban.
Last year, Congress passed additional gun control measures with some bipartisan support, its first major gun legislation in three decades. But the president continues to insist that's insufficient.
A time for Biden to ""be with Americans who are in mourning,"" says White House press secretary
""Too many times, the president and the first Lady have traveled to communities completely torn apart by gun violence,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday. ""As the president said last week, this is not normal, and we can't accept it as normal. So, while Friday will be a solemn day and a time for the president to be with Americans who are in mourning, he will also continue to demand that Congress act.""

President Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited Lewiston, Maine, on Friday to mourn the deaths of 18 people killed last week in the state's deadliest mass shooting in history.
The president delivered remarks to pay his respects to the victims, after meeting with first responders, nurses and other community members. The president will meet privately with families of the victims. In his remarks, the president did not call on Congress to pass specific gun control measures.
""You know as we mourn today in Maine, this tragedy opens a painful, painful wounds all across the country,"" the president said. ""Too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence. I know because Jill and I have met with them in Buffalo, in Uvalde, in Monterey Park, and Sandy Hook ... too many to count. Too many to count. From places that never made the news all across America.""
In addition to those who lost their lives in Maine, 13 people were injured last week when a gunman opened fire at a bar and a bowling alley. The shooter was found dead after a two-day manhunt.
After the mass shooting, Mr. Biden ordered the flags at the White House and federal buildings to fly at half staff and said in a statement, ""Far too many Americans have now had a family member killed or injured as a result of gun violence. That is not normal, and we cannot accept it.""
Biden meets with victims and families
The president and first lady are meeting with people who survived last week's attack, as well as many of the families who lost loved ones.
The meetings are closed to the press.
Biden says victims ""lived lives of love and service and sacrifice""
The president lamented the loss of life in the mass shooting. ""Eighteen precious souls stolen. Thirteen wounded,"" he said. ""...All of them lived lives of love and service and sacrifice.""
Mr. Biden also called attention to the survivors of the shooting.
""We also remember the survivors who will forever carry the memories and the physical and emotional scars of this,"" he said.
The president said that ""too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence.""
""Regardless of our politics, this is about protecting our freedom to go to a bowling alley, a restaurant a school, a church — without being shot and killed,"" the president said.
""Scripture says the Lord is near to the broken-hearted and saves the crushed in spirit — and saves the crushed in spirit,"" the president said. ""Our prayer is that the crushed in spirit survive this more rapidly than otherwise.""
The president did not call on Congress to pass specific gun control measures.
Biden meets first responders at bowling alley
The president and first lady are at Just-In-Time Recreation, the bowling alley where the gunman shot several people.
They're meeting with first responders and nurses who tended to the victims, as well as community leaders.
""The president and the first lady are meeting with first responders, including paramedics, health care providers, nurses, firefighters, and other law enforcement officials on the front lines of the response,"" the White House said.
Along the route from the bar to the bowling alley, onlookers lined the streets to watch the president's motorcade.
Biden visits memorial at shooting site
President Biden and the first lady made a stop at Schemengees Bar & Grille, one of the locations of the mass shooting, where a memorial has been set up in honor of the victims.
Mr. Biden placed a bouquet of flowers at the memorial, and he and the first lady observed the memorial in a moment of silence.
Flowers, carved pumpkins and signs mark the site.
""I am at a loss for words,"" Schemengees wrote on Facebook last week. ""In a split second your world gets turn upside down for no good reason. We loss great people in this community. How can we make any sense of this. Sending out prayers to everyone.""
Biden arrives in Maine
President Biden has landed in Maine. Several members of the state's congressional delegation are traveling with him — Republican Sen. Susan Collins and independent Sen. Angus King, as well as Rep. Chellie Pingree. First lady Jill Biden greeted them at the airport — she arrived separately from New York.
Maine's yellow-flag law
Law enforcement and gunman Robert Card's Army Reserve unit received warnings about his mental health and the threat he might pose in the months leading up to the shooting.
Three months before the mass shooting, Army Reserve unit leaders said he was ""behaving erratically,"" and the Army decided he shouldn't have a weapon, handle ammunition or ""participate in live fire activity,"" according to an Army spokesperson.
And according to a statement by Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry, his office was contacted in May by members of Card's family, who were concerned about his mental health and access to weapons. Merry said a deputy within his office contacted the reservist's Army Reserve training group, ""who assured our office that they would ensure that (he) received medical attention.""
Maine has a law on the books intended to deal with potentially dangerous individuals with firearms, a ""yellow-flag law."" Many states have red-flag laws, which enable family members or roommates of gun owners who they suspect may pose an immediate violent threat to seek an emergency court order forcing them to temporarily give up their firearms, though the gun owners may appeal the order.
Maine's yellow-flag law — the only one of its kind in the country, CBS News Boston notes — has a few more steps.

The surprise decision by Newport News Circuit Court Judge Matthew Hoffman means that Abby Zwerner could get much more than just workers compensation for the serious injuries caused by January’s classroom shooting.
Lawyers for Newport News Public Schools had tried to block the lawsuit, arguing that Zwerner was eligible only for workers compensation. It provides up to nearly 10 years pay and lifetime medical care for injuries.
Hoffman disagreed with the school board, concluding that Zwerner’s injuries âdid not arise out of her employmentâ and therefore did not âfall within the exclusive provisions of workersâ compensation coverage.â
The judge wrote: âThe danger of being shot by a student is not one that is peculiar or unique to the job of a first-grade teacher.”
Zwerner was hospitalized for nearly two weeks and endured multiple surgeries after a bullet struck her hand and chest. Zwerner alleges that administrators ignored multiple warnings the boy had a gun that day and had routinely dismissed ongoing concerns about his troubling behavior.
âThis victory is an important stepping stone on our path towards justice for Abby,” Zwerner’s attorneys, Diane Toscano, Jeffrey Breit and Kevin Biniazan, said in a statement.
âWe are eager to continue our pursuit of accountability and a just, fair recovery,â they said. “No teacher expects to stare down the barrel of a gun held by a six-year-old student.â
The school board’s attorneys indicated that they would appeal Friday’s decision and said in a statement that they âfully anticipate its reversal by the appellate court.â
The school board maintained that Zwerner’s injuries were directly related to her job and therefore covered under workers’ compensation.
âThe actual risk of employment in this scenario is that of a teacher being injured at the hands of a student which, unfortunately, is a fairly common occurrence and one that is only increasing in frequency this day and age,” school board attorney Anne Lehran said in a statement.
Some legal experts expected Zwerner’s lawsuit to fail under Virginiaâs uncommonly strict workers’ compensation law. That’s because it covers workplace assaults and allegations of negligence against employers. Lawsuits that might move forward in other states often falter in the Commonwealth.
Zwernerâs attorneys countered that workersâ compensation doesnât apply because a first-grade teacher would never anticipate getting shot: âIt was not an actual risk of her job.â
A tentative trial date for Zwerner’s lawsuit is scheduled for January 2025.
The classroom shooting by a first-grader revived a national dialogue about gun violence and roiled this military shipbuilding cit y near the Chesapeake Bay.
In early January, the 6-year-old pulled out his motherâs handgun and shot Zwerner as she sat at a reading table. She rushed the rest her students into the hallway before collapsing in the schoolâs office.
Zwerner sued in April, alleging school officials ignored multiple warnings that the boy had a gun and was in a violent mood.
Police have said the shooting was intentional. Zwerner claims school officials knew the boy âhad a history of random violenceâ at school and home, including when he âchokedâ his kindergarten teacher.
J. H. Verkerke, a University of Virginia law professor, previously told The Associated Press that Zwernerâs attorneys faced an uphill battle under the state’s workers’ compensation law. He said they needed to prove the shooting was unrelated to Zwernerâs job, even though she was shot in her classroom.
Their challenge was âto somehow make out that itâs personal,â Verkerke said.
In his ruling on Friday, Judge Hoffman wrote that the shooting against Zwerner was âpersonal.â
Judge Hoffman noted that the boy had the gun with him from the beginning of the school day until just before dismissal.
âIt was not until the student was back in (Zwerner’s) classroom that he decided to fire it once, striking (Zwerner),â Judge Hoffman wrote. âHe did not at any time threaten any other student, teacher or administrator at the school with a firearm.â
Zwernerâs attorneys argued in a brief last month that the boyâs âviolence was random and aimed at everyone, both in and out of school.â
He âasserted that he was angry that people were âpicking onâ his friend, a motivation that had nothing to do with (Zwerner),â her lawyers wrote without further elaboration. âHis motivation was a personal one.â
The school board disagreed and questioned how the shooting could be anything but work-related.
Responding to the judge’s decision on Friday, the school board’s attorneys said âit is clear that the student and Ms. Zwerner only knew each other through their teacher-student relationship.â
âIn order for a âpersonalâ action to defeat the exclusivity of the Workersâ Compensation Act, that personal motive must not be itself related to â¦ the employment,â they wrote.
Workersâ compensation laws were deemed a grand bargain in the 20th century between injured workers and employers, Verkerke said. Workers lost the ability to sue in most cases, protecting employers from enormous payouts. But people who were injured gained much easier access to compensation â lost pay and medical coverage â without having to prove fault.",N
Florida man hired hitmen to kill 17-year-old who accused him of sexual assault: police,2023-11-03,2023-11-04T04:06:28Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/03/news/florida-man-hired-hitmen-to-kill-17-year-old-who-accused-him-of-sexual-assault-police/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104040628id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/03/news/florida-man-hired-hitmen-to-kill-17-year-old-who-accused-him-of-sexual-assault-police/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104040628/https://nypost.com/2023/11/03/news/florida-man-hired-hitmen-to-kill-17-year-old-who-accused-him-of-sexual-assault-police/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMy9uZXdzL2Zsb3JpZGEtbWFuLWhpcmVkLWhpdG1lbi10by1raWxsLTE3LXllYXItb2xkLXdoby1hY2N1c2VkLWhpbS1vZi1zZXh1YWwtYXNzYXVsdC1wb2xpY2U~,"Four people have been charged in connection to the $10,000 murder-for-hire plot of a teenage girl after she reported a man had sexually assaulted her, the Department of Justice said.
Isabella Scavelli, 17, showed up at the Hernando County Sheriffâs Office in Florida on Feb. 6 and alleged that Lenard White — a 36-year-old man with multiple aliases — had sexually battered her.
White is accused of paying Keshawn Woods, 22, and Sheldon Robinson, 21, to murder the teen, according to WFLA.
On Feb. 7, Scavelli was fatally shot four times at her home alongside her mother who accompanied her in making the report after two men knocked on the victimâs door and opened fire.
Scavelli’s mother was seriously injured in the shooting, Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis said at the press conference Thursday.
âThe bullet that caused her death entered her lower left back area, suggesting that she was shot in the back as she was trying to run for cover,â attorney for the Middle District of Florida Roger Handberg shared during the press conference.
âShe was a good kid with a very bright future and to see her life cut short was heart-wrenching to say the least,â Nienhuis said at the press conference.
Police revealed that White — also known as Len, Mike Williams, and Stick — was named a suspect in the shooting following the report filed against him a day prior.
According to Fox 13, White went on a trip to Georgia the night of the teen’s shooting.
K9 units were deployed at the home soon after the shooting and tracked down a red Nike shoe with DNA belonging to Woods.
Robinson, 21, had asked for help with the grizzly murder for hire, saying he had a âclean-up jobâ and would give anyone willing to help him $5,000 and cocaine, according to HCSO.
Woods agreed to take part in the hit, police revealed.
Within hours of the murder, law enforcement conducted a search warrant on Woodsâ home and found nearly $4,000 in cash, along with a gun and illegal drugs.
A box of 9 mm rounds, which matched those found at the murder, was found after police searched Robinsonâs residence and a ballistics test was performed.
Investigators found the murder weapon buried in Robinsonâs backyard.
In the following months, the sheriffâs office and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) launched a joint investigation, Nienhuis said.
Robinsonâs mother, Janet Williams, found the other $6,000 used to pay for the hit but did not report her discovery to authorities.
Williams was charged with three counts of making a false statement as she was busted on a recorded call with her son and denied she found the money when confronted by the ATF.
âThey were asking meâ¦did you come into a whole bunch of money? I said No. But, you did come into a whole bunch of money,â Williams allegedly said, according to the outlet.
White, the alleged mastermind of this heartless murder-for-hire plot, was arrested on Feb. 15 on the sexual battery charges filed before the teenâs death.
All three men were indicted on a slew of charges, including murder for hire, conspiracy to commit murder for hire, discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime with violence that caused death and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime.
White and Robinson are set to appear in court on Nov. 9.
If convicted, White, Robinson, and Woods each face mandatory life imprisonment or the death penalty.
Williams, released on the condition of house arrest, faces a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison.",N

CHICAGO (CBS) -- Two teenage boys have been charged in connection with the deadly carjacking of an 86-year-old man just steps from his Auburn Gresham home in September.
Charles Hobson Sr. was getting something out of his car when he was shot just before 10 a.m. on Sept. 23 in the 8100 block of South Throop Street.
Police said Hobson was found on the sidewalk with a gunshot wound to the left thigh. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in critical condition and was later pronounced dead.
""Pretty much what we know is that my father-in-law came out of the house to come to his car to get his phone, and the next thing we know, he called his companion inside the house and said that he had been shot,"" his daughter-in-law, Kimberly Hobson-Gary, said on the day of the shooting.
Two boys, ages 15 and 16, were arrested on Thursday. The younger boy was charged with one count of first-degree murder, and the older boy was charged with one count of aggravated vehicular hijacking and one count of possession of a stolen vehicle.
Chicago Police Chief of Detectives Antoinette Ursitti said it took diligence to track down the two teens.
""Our detectives worked tirelessly to gain the identity of the two responsible for this crime, and in doing so we worked with the team in order to locate them and take them into custody,"" she said. ""This is just an example of how we will never forget our crime victims.""
The two boys faced a Juvenile Court judge for the first time on Friday, and will be held in custody. They were due back in Juvenile Court on Dec. 4.
Hobson-Gary said her father-in-law lived on the 8100 block of South Throop Street for nearly 60 years, and was referred to as the neighborhood's grandfather.
""He was spunky. He was an awesome man of God. He's been in his home for probably nearly 58 years, and he was an entrepreneur; retired, of course, but an entrepreneur. He was a community man, and he just cared for others. He was very caring to other people, and so this is very devastating that this would happen to anyone, not just him,"" Hobson-Gary said.
His friendly nature left loved ones wondering why someone would do this.
""This is senseless. That's what we know. We do know that it was senseless. They did take his car. The car is back. It's torn in pieces, and he's no longer here, so we really don't know what the reason is,"" Hobson-Gary said.
""They had taken his vehicle, left, returned to the scene, and then got caught trying to get back into his house,"" said neighbor Tamika Wright.
CBS 2's Tara Molina has been tracking juvenile crime for years. According to the latest data on juvenile offenders from the Cook County State's Attorney's office, the number of charged carjacking cases has dropped from 215 in 2021 to 194 last year, and 149 so far this year. But armed robberies are way up, from 136 charged cases in 2021 to 281 so far this year.

MIAMI -- One month after being found guilty by a Miami-Dade jury in connection with a mass shooting outside the El Mula Banquet Hall, Davonte Barnes was ordered to serve life in prison for his role in what the prosecution said was the ""largest mass shooting in Miami-Dade County history.""
Barnes, who had apologized to the families of the victims before his sentencing, displayed no emotion as Circuit Court Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez announced her verdict. She had rejected an appeal by the defense to deviate from sentencing guidelines and impose a less harsh sentence.
""The actions and carnage was as if Mr. Barnes had pulled the trigger himself,"" she said before announcing the three life sentences that to be served consecutively.
Before the judge handed down her sentence, Barnes turned to the family of the victims and addressed them.
""I extend my apologies to the family,"" he said. ""I'm truly sorry for what happened to those"" victims.
Memorial Day weekend mass shooting
Barnes, 24, was convicted by a jury on Sept. 30 of second-degree murder in the killings of Desmond Owens and Clayton Dillard III, both 26, and Shaniqua Peterson, 32. Jurors also convicted Barnes of attempted second-degree murder on several other counts related to the incident.
He was found not guilty of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder with a deadly weapon, however
The state waived the death penalty for Barnes so the ultimate sentence was a life sentence.
During his two-week trial in September, prosecutors had accused Barnes of being the lookout during the 2021 shooting
During the two-week trial, jurors saw police interrogating Barnes about the incident, which prosecutors said resulted from an ongoing feud between two rival gangs over who would be king of Opa-locka.
Owens, Dillard and Peterson were killed while nearly two dozen others were hurt during the shooting on May 30. The shooting occurred as a crowd had gathered to attend a rap show.
Relatives of the slain victims address Davonte Barnes
During the sentencing, relatives of Owens, Dillard and Peterson faced Barnes.
""My two sons struggle every day (now) that their baby sister is gone,"" said Charlene Peterson, the mother of Shaniqua Peterson. ""For what? For people to have power over territory?""
Tammy Anderson, Dillard's mother, said: ""You took my son away from me. You weren't the shooter but you need to pay for what you did!""
The defense attorney asked the judge to consider a sentence that was less than a life sentence, citing a state law that allows the court to impose varying sentences.
""Give him a second chance at life,"" the defense lawyer said. ""It's not going to serve anyone to have him in prison for the rest of his life.""
But the judge rejected that request, which the prosecution also rebuffed.
""This was the largest mass shooting in Miami-Dade County history period,"" the prosecutor said. ""I disagree with finding of principle that allows for"" downgrade of the sentence.

The letter did not repeat the messages in full but included phrases by the writer that they were âstrappedâ and âwanted scalps,â as well as a warning to the recipient to âavoid the gym for a while.â
The texts went on to say the gym had âbeen way too lenient with all the wannabes here. no masâ and that the member âalready has a kill orderâ and âgod has spoken.â When the person who received the messages asked, âwdym stay away from the gym? Everything okay?â, the member replied, âiâll know soon enough.â
Antisemitic messages found painted outside Canterâs Deli and other locations in the Fairfax District are being investigated as possible hate crimes, the LAPD said.
The Oct. 25 walkout coincidentally happened the same day as 18 people were killed in a mass shooting in Maine, which put people throughout the nation on edge as police hunted for the gunman, who was later found dead.
âMass shootings happen virtually every single day in this country,â the open letter states. âThis is part of our new normal.â
In a staffwide email sent Tuesday that was shared with The Times, company Chief Executive Mark Melvin said the threats were not found to be credible.
Melvin said in the email that the threats were immediately reported to law enforcement, which determined they were not credible and told company officials to âtake no further action and not to alarm our staff and community.â
Although gym owners and upper management were informed of the threats, according to the open letter, staff members did not learn about them until Oct. 25. It is not clear from the letter how employees learned of the texts. Staff asked to see the messages but were unable to get them from management, the letter says, so they walked off the job, causing the gym to close early.
The letter criticizes managementâs decision to withhold the threats from staff, as well as the actions taken without input from staff.
In his email to staff, Melvin said external security was hired at all five locations in Southern California, and the person who wrote the texts was banned from all gym locations.
Melvin in his email emphasized that the text message threats never specified a location, that they were not deemed credible by law enforcement, that there was no active shooter present and that the messages were simply âpersonal communicationâ between two gym members.
Ex-MLB player charged in father-in-lawâs killing also committed child abuse, prosecutors say
Danny Serafini, who is accused of killing his father-in-law and attempting to kill his mother-in-law, was charged by prosecutors with child abuse of two infants.
The gym remained closed Oct. 26 because of the walkout but reopened the following day, according to Melvin. Staff also began circulating a letter to gym members, encouraging them to freeze or cancel their memberships and to donate the funds to a GoFundMe fundraiser toward staff to make up for lost wages during the walkout.
Hollywood Boulders management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
âThis is the first time weâve experienced anything like this, and we know our response wasnât perfect,â Melvinâs email concludes. âGiven the tragic state of gun violence in our nation, we understand why some members of our community were alarmed to learn about some details of these events through various online channels.â

VICTIMS OF MAINE MASS SHOOTING RANGED IN AGE FROM 14 TO 76, MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS
MAINE MASS SHOOTING SUSPECT FOUND DEAD, SOURCES SAY
The alleged gunman, Robert Card, 40, was found dead of an apparent suicide after a dayslong manhunt that led officials to cancel school and order residents to stay indoors.
Investigators have yet to establish a motive but have increasingly focused on the mental health of Card, who was a firearms instructor.
Authorities said this week that Card's family had brought their concerns about his deteriorating mental health to the local sheriff five months before the deadly rampage. Card had also undergone a mental health evaluation after he began behaving erratically at a training facility last summer.
Several thousand people attended vigils for the victims over the weekend, and residents started returning to work and school on Monday after stay-at-home orders were lifted.
MAINE POLICE AUDIO DESCRIBES FRANTIC MASS SHOOTING RESPONSE: 'MULTIPLE VICTIMS'
Biden was alerted about the shooting as he hosted a White House state dinner honoring the bonds between the United States and Australia. He later stepped out of the event to speak by telephone with Maine Gov. Janet Mills and the state's representatives in Congress.
In a written statement, the president decried the ""senseless and tragic"" shooting and urged Republicans in Congress to help pass legislation that would outlaw assault-style weapons and high capacity magazines, enact universal background checks, require that guns be stored safely and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers.
Biden also ordered that U.S. flags on public property be flown at half-staff through Monday out of respect for the victims.",N

""There's a spot that looks so real life that a person could have, or at least started to have, dug there, but there was no body,"" said Swanson as he held up the letter and pointed to it. ""This is why we need to talk to this person.

More than 500 acres from Ogemaw County to Ohio, which spans five counties and two states, have been searched along with 100 hours of drone footage, Swanson said on Wednesday.

Police say McWhirter, a 60-year-old Genesee County employee, was killed and that her estranged husband, Steven Higgins, is the prime suspect.

Salem State University freshman Carl-Hens Beliard, 18, was found with gunshot wounds inside a vehicle at around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, officials said. He was rushed to Salem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
âThis does not appear to be a random act of violence or that there is any ongoing threat to the SSU community,â Salem police stated.
That night, Essex County District Attorney Paul Tuckerâs office announced that Missael Pena Canela, also 18, of Salem, was arrested on a murder charge, the Boston Globe reported.
Details about how he was identified as a suspect have not been released.
âThis senseless gun violence is tragic not only for the victimâs family but for the SSU community and beyond,â Tucker said in a statement.
University President John Keenan expressed his sorrow over the senseless death, which occurred as revelers had crowded the city for its Halloween celebration â and days before Beliard was to play his first college hoops game.
âAs both the Salem State president and a college dad, this tragedy is heartbreaking for all in our community and every parentâs worst nightmare,â he said in a release.
The shooting took place across from a parking lot near the schoolâs athletics facilities, the Boston Globe reported.
âHe was such a good kid,â Beliardâs mother, Altagrace Beliard, told WHDH.
She âsaid basketball had been his passion since he was just 2 years old and that he dreamed of becoming a star.
âHe never gave up. No matter how hard it was, he kept pushing himself,â the grieving mom said.
Belliard, a forward on the menâs basketball team, was a member of Worcesterâs North High School varsity boys basketball team, which was honored in May by Worcester Mayor Joseph Pettey for winning the Division 1 State Championship.
The team defeated Needham 73-64 in March to claim the title after a 24-2 season, according to theâ Worcester Telegram & Gazette.
Beliard, the teamâs only senior, said at a rally celebrating the victory that the championship felt âlike a dream come true.â
ââEver since I started playing basketball, I always wanted to win a championship. Itâs an amazing feeling,â he told the Telegram. âWe have a lot of chemistry on the team and thatâs how we got so far, thatâs why weâre here right now.
âWe hang out outside of basketball. Weâre all playing basketball. Itâs really like a brotherhood,â he added.
The 6-foot-5 forward told the paper he planned to study exercise science in college and eventually pursue a doctorate in physical therapy. He also spoke of the teamâs camaraderie on and off the court.
The young man also made the high schoolâs honor roll in the second quarter of his senior year, according to the Boston Globe.
Al Pettway, Worcesterâs North High School dean of students and boys basketball coach, shared his memories of Beliard on Wednesday afternoon.
âHe was a great kid, smart, smart student, he had a smile that would just brighten up any room when he would open his mouth, so we lost a really, really good one today, unfortunately,â Pettway said, according to the Globe.
âI had just spoken to him about a month ago, he was excited about school, enjoying himself, he sent me his basketball schedule so I was excited about going to watch him play,â he said.
âCollege basketball starts very shortly, so I was really excited about going to see him play in uniform, and unfortunately thatâs not gonna happen,â Pettway added.
He said it was tough to inform Beliardâs former teammates about his death.
âThey were in shock. They thought I was talking about a different Carl. They repeated several times, âWhich Carl?â And I kind of reinforced to them that it was our Carl,â Pettway said, WHDH reported.
Massachusetts Gov. Gov. Maura Healey also spoke about the loss, telling reporters that âitâs incredibly sad. Heartbreaking.â
Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo described the shooting as a terrible act of violence.
âOur hearts go out to the Beliard family and to the Salem State University community,â he said in a statement.
Worcester Mayor Joe Petty said he was âheartbroken to hear about the tragic loss.â
âCarl was a hardworking, kind individual whose life was taken too soon,â he wrote on Facebook.
âIt is every parent’s worst nightmare to lose a child. As a father of three, I simply cannot imagine the pain that the Carl’s family is going through. My sincere condolences and thoughts are with the family at this time. My heart goes out to Carl’s family, teammates, and friends,â he added.

Jennifer Crumbley has been telling other inmates that she blames her husband James for their son Ethan killing four students at Oxford High School in 2021, prosecutors alleged in a new filing Friday.
“James Crumbley should be aware of the fact that (his wife) Jennifer Crumbley has placed blame on him in jail communications,” Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor Marc Keast wrote, according to the Detroit Free Press.
The mother and father have been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter for the four students who died in the shooting. They have pleaded not guilty.
Jennifer allegedly has told other inmates that she blames James for purchasing the gun for their underage son just days before he would open fire in the school, and claimed he ignored Ethan’s mental health issues, according to WWMT.
Prosecutors also said that Ethan had told James he needed a doctor for his mental health and the father allegedly ignored his requests.
However, the defense has accused prosecutors of trying to drive a wedge between the parents and make it appear that they are “not united.”
“This could not be more untrue,” Jennifer’s lawyer Shannon Smith wrote in the filing Friday.
The emergency filing was prompted by Jennifer’s lawyer, who asked the prosecution to privately disclose any concerning issues they believed could cause a mistrial, according to the Detroit Free Press.
Prosecutors have made concerns known about the parents having separate lawyers, but Smith argued neither has filed a motion the “other party did not join.”
Jennifer and James are scheduled to go to trial in 11 weeks. Meanwhile, their son, now 17, will be sentenced on Dec. 7 and faces life without parole.
Ethan, who pleaded guilty in October 2022, has been charged with 24 counts, including four for first-degree murder for the deaths ofÂ Madisyn Baldwin, Tate Myre, Hana St. Juliana, and Justin Shilling.
Six other students and one teacher were also injured in the shooting. Ethan was 15 at the time of the shooting.
His defense is hoping the judge will settle for a lesser sentence, but Judge KwamÃ© Rowe seems unlikely to pick that option. He claimed the crime was “not the result of impetuosity or recklessness.”
âNor does the crime reflect the hallmarks of youth. Defendant carefully and meticulously planned and carried out the shooting,” he said in September.
After the crime, James and Jennifer took off after being charged, causing the US Marshals, FBI, and Michigan police to search for them.
They were found several hours later at an art studio in a commercial building in Detroit.",N

The Many Missed Warnings Before Maine’s Mass Shooting
The police were warned about the deteriorating mental health of an Army reservist months before a deadly shooting.

Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Music
The mass shooting in Maine last week, which killed 18 people, was the country’s deadliest of the year. It may have also been one of the most avoidable.
More than five months earlier, the Army Reserve and a Maine sheriff’s department had been made aware of a reservist’s deteriorating mental health. Just six weeks before the killings, he had punched a friend and said he was going to carry out a shooting spree.
Nicholas Bogel-Boroughs, a national reporter for The Times, explains why so many warnings failed to stop the shooting.
On today’s episode
Background reading
The Army Reserve and a Maine sheriff’s department knew of a reservist’s deteriorating mental health five months before America’s deadliest mass shooting this year.

âNot guilty,â Davis said when the judge asked for his plea.
The judge told Davis that prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty in the case, which could put Davis in prison for the rest of his life if he is convicted.
Jones also named county special public defenders Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano to represent Davis at taxpayer expense, after Davis lost his bid to hire private defense attorney Ross Goodman.
Goodman two weeks ago said prosecutors lack witnesses and key evidence, including a gun or vehicle, for the killing committed 27 years ago.

Outside the courtroom on Thursday, Goodman said Davis was still trying to hire him.
Davisâ family members declined to comment.
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told reporters that he and a panel of prosecutors decided the case against Davis was ânot the kind of case that should proceed with the asking of the death penalty.â
He didnât specify the reasons for that decision.
Wolfson also declined to respond to Goodmanâs criticism of the lack of evidence, saying that a jury would weigh the results of the police investigation.
In court, Davis wore dark-blue jail garb and answered several questions, telling the judge that he attended âa year in college,â wasnât under the influence of drugs, medication, or alcohol, and he understood he was charged with murder.
The judge set his next court date for Tuesday to schedule the trial.
Davis, 60, is originally from Compton, California.
He was arrested Sept. 29 outside a home in suburban Henderson where Las Vegas police served a search warrant July 17, drawing renewed attention to one of hip-hop musicâs most enduring mysteries.
Davis remains jailed without bail, did not testify before the grand jury that indicted him and declined from jail to speak with The Associated Press.
The indictment alleges Davis obtained and provided a gun to someone in the back seat of a Cadillac before the car-to-car gunfire that mortally wounded Shakur and wounded rap music mogul Marion âSugeâ Knight at an intersection just off the Las Vegas Strip.
Shakur died a week later. He was 25.
Knight, now 58, is in prison in California, serving a 28-year sentence for the death of a Compton businessman in 2015.
He has not responded to messages through his attorneys seeking comment about Davisâ arrest.
Prosecutors allege that Shakurâs killing in Las Vegas came out of competition between East Coast members of a Bloods gang sect and West Coast groups of a Crips sect, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre dubbed âgangsta rap.â
The grand jury was told the Sept. 7, 1996 shooting in Las Vegas was retaliation for a brawl hours earlier at a Las Vegas Strip casino involving Shakur and Davisâ nephew, Orlando âBaby Laneâ Anderson.
Prosecutors told a grand jury that Davis implicated himself in the killing in multiple interviews and a 2019 tell-all memoir that described his life leading a Crips sect in Compton.
Davis has said he obtained a .40-caliber handgun and handed it to Anderson, a member of Davisâ gang, in the back seat of a Cadillac, though he didnât identify Anderson as the shooter.
Anderson, then 22, denied involvement in Shakurâs killing and died two years later in a shooting in his hometown of Compton.
The other back seat passenger and the driver of the Cadillac are also dead.
In his book, Davis wrote that he told authorities in 2010 what he knew of the killings of Shakur and gang rival Notorious B.I.G, whose legal name is Christopher Wallace, to protect himself and 48 of his Southside Compton Crips gang associates from prosecution and the possibility of life sentences in prison.
Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls, was shot and killed in Los Angeles in March 1997, six months after Shakurâs death.
Shakur is largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time.
He had five No. 1 albums, was nominated for six Grammy Awards, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, and received a posthumous star this year on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",N
Florida man brings loaded gun into bar as part of costume: ‘Figured because it was Halloween I could try’,2023-11-02,2023-11-03T06:21:47Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/02/news/florida-man-brings-loaded-gun-into-crowded-bar-as-part-of-costume/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103062147id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/02/news/florida-man-brings-loaded-gun-into-crowded-bar-as-part-of-costume/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103062147/https://nypost.com/2023/11/02/news/florida-man-brings-loaded-gun-into-crowded-bar-as-part-of-costume/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMi9uZXdzL2Zsb3JpZGEtbWFuLWJyaW5ncy1sb2FkZWQtZ3VuLWludG8tY3Jvd2RlZC1iYXItYXMtcGFydC1vZi1jb3N0dW1l,"A Florida man was arrested Tuesday for carrying a loaded gun into a packed bar — and he offered up a series of bizarre excuses before telling cops the weapon was part of his Halloween costume.
Michael Ribar, 22, was charged with two counts of open carrying of weapons after concerned partygoers flagged police to an armed man clad in a bulletproof vest at a tavern in DeLand, a city 40 miles northeast of Orlando.
Police found Ribar sitting in the dining area of the crowded bar just before 9 p.m. with a “visible handgun on his right hip,” according to an arrest affidavit reviewed by The Post.
At the request of the officers, Ribar handed over the 9mm semi-automatic, revealing that there was a live round inside the chamber, the DeLand department claims.
He was also allegedly decked out in a mask, ballistic vest, motorcycle shirt and tactical belt, which had a medical kit, two handcuffs and a baton, which earned him the second weapons charge.
Ribar allegedly tested out a few ways to justify bringing the loaded weapon to the bar — including that he had driven straight to the pub from the shooting range and just “threw this on,” referencing his open carry holster.
When asked why he didn’t leave the gun in his car, he only shrugged but didn’t reply.
He also tried to tell cops he found a loophole for bringing the gun into an establishment that serves liquor by stationing himself in the dining area and away from the bartenders, the documents claim.
Ultimately, Ribar allegedly admitted he thought he could carry the firearm along with the tactical duty belt, ballistic vest and mask because it was part of his costume.
“I figured because it was Halloween I could try,” the affidavit quotes him as saying.
Ribar’s girlfriend also threw him under the bus, telling cops that he had not actually been at the firing range that day, but left for the bar straight from his home.
She also gave up a vital piece of information: that he had settled on wearing the outfit almost six hours earlier.
“She asked Ribar if he really wanted to openly carry his firearm with the attire, to which he stated yes,” the affidavit states.
What Ribar’s costume was — and whether he intended to be a police officer or a mass shooter — is unclear.
The owner of the bar asked Ribar to leave the property, just before he was arrested.
He was later released after posting a $1,000 bond.",N

Israel, the I.R.S. and the Big Grift
Opinion Columnist
Historians of propaganda are familiar with the concept of the Big Lie, a claim so extreme that many people end up accepting it because they can’t believe that authority figures would make up something so at odds with reality.
It often seems to me that we need a term to describe a somewhat similar phenomenon in policy debates, which we might call the Big Grift: policy proposals so corrupt, so obviously designed to benefit an undeserving few at everyone else’s expense that many voters balk at the notion that seemingly respectable politicians actually advocate such things.
A case in point is the current demand by House Republicans that funding for Israel in this moment of crisis be tied to budget cuts that would undermine the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. This should be a major scandal, but my suspicion is that many voters just won’t accept the idea that G.O.P. leaders would do something so cartoonishly villainous.
Some history: Way back in 2001, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, House Republicans passed a bill responding to the emergency by … cutting corporate taxes. At the time, my sources told me that when political consultants tried to describe the bill to focus groups of voters, they refused to believe that the legislation was being described accurately.
A decade later, when Mitt Romney endorsed Paul Ryan’s budget plan — which called for both tax cuts on high incomes and the conversion of Medicare into an underfunded voucher scheme — a focus group found voters simply unwilling to believe that this was Romney’s actual position.
The latest G.O.P. proposal is, by any reasonable standard, even worse than these earlier initiatives. I mean, holding national security hostage unless we make it easier for wealthy tax cheats to break the law? Who would do that?
Yet I fear that the proposal’s very awfulness may protect it from scrutiny, because voters will be incredulous about claims that this idea is even on the table.
Still, I guess we do need to discuss the substance of the proposal, on the off chance that somebody might be paying attention.
First, the idea that cutting the I.R.S. budget would somehow help pay for aid to Israel is utterly wrong. America has a huge “tax gap” — taxes legally owed but not paid. The bulk of that tax gap probably comes from wealthy Americans underreporting their incomes, which they can get away with because the I.R.S. lacks the resources to fully enforce the law.
As a result, cutting I.R.S. funding would actually increase the deficit by enabling more tax evasion, a conclusion confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday in its score of the House proposal.
Republicans, however, often claim that tax cuts do great things for the economy, and maybe even pay for themselves. There’s not a shred of evidence for that belief. Still, starving the I.R.S. of funds is in a way a kind of tax cut. So can’t they make a similar argument here?
No, for several reasons.
For one thing, even if you believe (wrongly) that low taxes on the rich strongly encourage entrepreneurship or something, making it easier for a businessman to cheat on his taxes probably doesn’t have the same incentive effects as reducing his legal tax rate.
Furthermore, enabling tax evasion doesn’t help all businesses equally; it biases the economy toward activities, often unproductive, where tax fraud is relatively easy, such as real estate speculation. Did I mention that the Trump Organization has been convicted of tax fraud?
And making it easier to cheat on taxes by defunding the tax police probably has spillover effects that go beyond the direct adverse effect on enforcement. The more we become a society that rewards people who evade their fiscal obligations, the more likely it is that people who don’t cheat on their taxes will feel like chumps and losers. If Americans start to believe, as Leona Helmsley put it, that “only the little people pay taxes,” the damage to our society will surely be moral as well as fiscal.
Yet starving the I.R.S. has long been a Republican priority; what’s new is the party’s willingness to serve that priority by endangering national security.
Where does this priority come from? I don’t pretend to have a full answer. I will note, however, that, as the historian Rick Perlstein has pointed out, there has long been a close association between right-wing conspiracy theorizing and financial grifting. Alex Jones, the proprietor of the conspiracy site Infowars, best known for claiming that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook was a left-wing hoax, made his money by selling bogus dietary supplements — what my colleague Farhad Manjoo calls the “wellness-conspiracy industrial complex.”
And now that conspiracy theorists have effectively taken over the G.O.P., it kind of makes sense that one of their overriding policy priorities is to deprive the government of the resources it needs to crack down on grifters and financial fraud.
In any case, don’t be skeptical about news reports that Republicans are willing to sacrifice crucial national interests unless we make life easier for tax cheats. That is, in fact, exactly what is happening.

Kaitlin Armstrong, 37, is on trial for the murder of Anna Moriah ""Mo"" Wilson, a 25-year-old star on the gravel cycling scene who had gone out swimming and to dinner with the suspect's boyfriend, fellow pro Colin Strickland, just before her shooting death.
Caitlin Cash, Wilson's friend with whom she was staying while visiting the Texas city for a race, called 911 after she came home and found the carnage on May 11, 2022, according to courtroom testimony.

Police found Wilson slumped over in a puddle of blood in Cash's apartment bathroom, according to prosecutors.
Cash, in tearful testimony, told the court she first thought that her friend was lying down to cool off – but knew something was wrong when she got closer and saw the blood.
Kaitlin Armstrong stood over Mo Wilson and put a third shot right in Mo Wilson's heart.

A nearby security camera picked up the sound of Wilson's terrified cries followed by two gunshots, Jones said, accentuating the allegation by clapping his hands and shouting, ""Pow! Pow!""
""After 45 seconds of silence, Kaitlin Armstrong stood over Mo Wilson and put a third shot right in Mo Wilson’s heart,"" he said.
Wilson, a college skiing star, had picked up gravel racing several years ago, Jones told the jury. She quickly found success – growing into ""one of the best in the world"" at the sport, and was visiting Texas for a race at the time of her death.
That's how she met Colin Strickland, another pro cyclist and Armstrong's live-in, on-and-off boyfriend, according to Jones.
Armstrong had access to Strickland's iPhone text messages through his iPad and Mac laptop, according to investigators, and also allegedly stalked Wilson's whereabouts through Strava, a GPS-linked fitness app for cyclists and runners. On May 2, according to Jones, she even logged into his Gmail and Instagram accounts on her own phone.

Although Strickland told investigators after the murder that he didn't believe Armstrong was jealous or violent, Jones said in court that he'd changed Wilson's name in his phone to ""Christine Walsh.""
Austin police questioned Armstrong in connection with the shooting the next day – then let her go on an unrelated warrant due to a clerical error.

On May 13, Armstrong sold her Jeep – the suspect vehicle – at an Austin CarMax and took a rideshare to the airport, where she flew to New York, according to prosecutors. There, she met her sister, obtained her passport, and left for New Jersey, where she caught a flight from Newark to Costa Rica and eluded authorities for weeks.
After a 43-day manhunt, Costa Rican police arrested her on an immigration violation and sent her back to the U.S. Marshals to face a murder charge.

Jones also confirmed in court widespread rumors that she'd undergone plastic surgery while on the run.
""She spent $6,425 to change her appearance,"" he told the jury. ""You'll also see before and after photos in those medical records.""
Last month, with the trial date looming, she allegedly feigned an injury and tried to run away from Texas jail guards. She picked her cuffs, ditched her striped jail pants and made it about a mile before they recaptured her, according to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital.

One of Armstrong's defense attorneys, Geoffrey Puryear, in his own opening statement skewered the detectives on the case and said the prosecution had no hard evidence linking her to the crime. He also tried to cast doubts on two key pieces of evidence – DNA and ballistics linking his client to the crime scene, as ""inaccurate, unreliable and unscientific.""
""They were so desperate to keep Kaitlin Armstrong in their crosshairs that they had tunnel vision, and they jumped to conclusions,"" he said.
An angry Jones interrupted his remarks repeatedly, accusing him of making arguments during his opening statement, which isn't allowed – objections the judge sustained.

He was convicted in the decades-old cold case earlier this year, even though Smart's body was never found. She was declared legally dead in 2002.

Man Accused in Tupac Shakur’s Murder Pleads Not Guilty
The suspect, Duane Keith Davis, faces a charge of murder with a deadly weapon. He has spoken openly about his presence at the scene in a memoir and interviews.
Pashtana Usufzy and
Pashtana Usufzy reported from Las Vegas, and Julia Jacobs from New York.
A man who for years has said he was a critical player in the gang-orchestrated shooting of the rapper Tupac Shakur pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a charge of murder with a deadly weapon, following an indictment that thrust the dormant case back into public view.
The man, Duane Keith Davis, known as Keffe D, has spoken and written about how he was inside the vehicle from which shots were fired at Mr. Shakur in 1996.
Wearing a dark blue inmate’s outfit and cuffs on his wrists and ankles, Mr. Davis, 60, looked directly at the judge as he entered his plea, asking for clarification when the prosecutors said they did not plan to ask for the death penalty in the case.
His arraignment had been delayed for weeks because he previously did not have a lawyer to represent him. At Thursday’s hearing, Mr. Davis was represented by the public defender’s office, though he told the judge that he hoped to retain Ross Goodman, a high-profile defense lawyer whose parents have both served as the mayor of Las Vegas.
Two public defenders assigned to Mr. Davis, Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano, declined to comment after the hearing. Mr. Goodman told reporters that he still supported Mr. Davis and hoped to represent him. “There are people who are trying to get the financial resources together to hire me,” Mr. Goodman said.
In a news conference after Mr. Davis’s arrest in September, the police said he had been a leader of the South Side Compton Crips when he directed the shooting of Mr. Shakur after his nephew and fellow gang member, Orlando Anderson, was beaten up by Mr. Shakur and his associates earlier that night. The instigating attack had taken place at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas, where members of two warring gangs — along with some of the top players in gangster rap — had converged on a Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon prizefight.
The investigation into the killing stalled in the years after Mr. Shakur’s death. The police attributed that to a lack of cooperation from witnesses, but some considered it a failure to properly devote resources to solving the murder of a young Black rapper who had risen to the top of his industry by the age of 25.
The killing continued to be a source of intrigue for rap fans and internet sleuths, and Mr. Davis began sharing his account of the events in Las Vegas with filmmakers, YouTube interviewers and readers of his 2019 memoir, “Compton Street Legend.” In the book, Mr. Davis describes obtaining a .40-caliber Glock pistol just before he and a crew of Crips sought revenge for the beating of Mr. Anderson.
It was Mr. Davis’s own words about his involvement that reinvigorated the case, the authorities said. The case against him ramped up in July, when the police searched his home in Henderson, Nev.
Clifford Mogg, a retired homicide detective who started looking into the case in 2018, around the time that Mr. Davis gave his first public interview on the subject, told grand jurors that in the search, investigators recovered Mr. Davis’s cellphone, a copy of his book and two bins of photographs and other materials, including a photo album with news clippings related to Mr. Shakur’s murder.
Mr. Davis, who has spoken publicly about his career in the drug trade in great detail, has been in and out of prison for the past 40 years, in part on federal drug trafficking charges.",N

Prosecutors wonât seek the death penalty against the man accused of orchestrating the killing of Tupac Shakur, they told a Las Vegas judge Thursday as Duane âKeffe Dâ Davis pleaded not guilty to murder.
Davis, 60, a self-admitted shot caller of the Compton Southside Crips, appeared in court handcuffed and told the judge he understood the charge he faced. He then entered his plea on his third court appearance since his late September arrest in one of the nationâs most infamous celebrity murder cases.
After Clark County Judge Tierra D. Jones asked prosecutors whether they would seek the death penalty against Davis in the 1996 slaying, a prosecutor said they were not planning to ask a review panel to consider such a move.
Davis asked the judge to explain what she meant by the question.
âEvery first-degree murder case, I have to ask the state if they are going to commit to going to committee to seek the death penalty,â Jones said.
Davis was represented Thursday by special public defenders Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano. Two weeks ago, Jones had delayed his arraignment while a new lawyer, Ross Goodman, sought to take over legal representation. Though no agreement has been reached, Davis told Jones he still intended to have Goodman represent him.
The judge set a next appearance for Nov. 7.
Clark County Dist. Atty. Steve Wolfson told reporters after Thursdayâs hearing that prosecutors had talked about the death penalty and determined it was not a case in which they would seek it. Wolfson said he believed the trial would start sometime next year.
Following Davisâ last appearance, Goodman, the son of former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman and current Mayor Carolyn Goodman, suggested police had no evidence beyond Davisâ stories and questioned how authorities could verify his recounting of his involvement in the deadly confrontation on Sept. 7, 1996.
âAs everyone here knows, you have to corroborate those statements. You donât have a car, you donât have a gun and you donât have witnesses to corroborate with what Mr. Davis said under those circumstances,â Goodman said. âI believe there is an obvious defense to that â why he made those statements and a motive for making those statements.â
No gun, no car, no witnesses: Lawyer says police have nothing but suspectâs stories in Tupac Shakur killing
Duane âKeffe Dâ Davis remains in custody on an indictment of murder, accused of organizing the killing of Tupac Shakur. But his lawyer says authorities have nobody to verify the tales of his involvement.
Prosecutors say Davis, who was indicted by a grand jury on a charge of murder with a firearm, didnât pull the trigger but provided the gun and encouraged the killing as revenge for a beating that his nephew Orlando Anderson had received at the hands of Shakur, Death Row Records head Marion âSugeâ Knight and others affiliated with the Mob Piru Bloods at the MGM Grand Hotel hours earlier.
Knight was driving Shakur in a BMW near the Las Vegas Strip when a white Cadillac pulled alongside them and a gunman opened fire on Shakur, according to police and court records. Knight and Davis are the only living witnesses.
Authorities have said some of the most compelling evidence against Davis comes from the suspect himself.
Davis identified Anderson as the shooter in 2008 when he finally talked to authorities with the protection of a proffer from the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI, meaning his statements could not be used against him. In that interview, then-LAPD Det. Greg Kading asked whether Anderson, a.k.a. Baby Lane, had pulled the trigger.
Shakur âleaned over, and Orlando rolled down the window and popped him,â Davis replied. âIf they would have drove on my side, I would have popped them. But they was on the other side.â
When Kading and the LAPDâs Daryl Dupree interviewed Davis in December 2008, they were seeking to solve the 1997 slaying of rapper Christopher Wallace, or âThe Notorious B.I.G.,â also known as Biggie Smalls. The proffer information could not be used to charge Davis, but his statements since were part of the evidence presented to the grand jury this year.
In his 2019 memoir and in several interviews, Davis admitted to riding in the car from which the fatal shots were fired at the Los Angeles hip-hop legend. Davis was taken into custody Friday morning.
Davis wanted to make money off Shakurâs death, prosecutors said, and âtalked himself into a cornerâ since the police interview. He believed he still had immunity, as recently as 2022 telling YouTube account Cam Capone News that it was the only reason he was not in custody for Shakurâs killing.
He would repeat the story he told Kading in a series of internet and blog interviews. But in his 2019 book, âCompton Street Legend,â Davis began to change the narrative.
âTupac made an erratic move and began to reach down beneath his seat,â Davis wrote. âIt was the first and only time in my life that I could relate to the police command, âKeep your hands where I can see them.â Instead, Pac pulled out a strap, and thatâs when the fireworks started. One of my guys from the back seat grabbed the Glock and started bustinâ back.â
Anderson, who was killed in a gang shootout in Compton a year and a half after Shakurâs death, was long considered the gunman; The Times identified him as such in 1998. At the time of Shakurâs shooting, he was in the back of the Cadillac with DeAndre âBig Dreâ Smith, who died in 2004. Davis was in the front passenger seat, he has said, and the car was driven by Terrence âBubble Upâ Brown, who died in a 2015 shooting at a medical marijuana dispensary in Compton.
Tupac Shakurâs killing brought â10 days of hellâ to Compton. The bloodshed helped crack the case
How Tupac Shakurâs killing in 1996 brought â10 days of hellâ to Compton, with multiple shootings that helped crack the case.
After the Las Vegas shooting, Compton police saw â10 days of hell,â according to Robert Ladd, a former Compton detective who investigated Shakurâs death and the retaliatory killings that spiraled from it. By its end, three people were dead and 10 were wounded.
Solving Shakurâs killing was not the responsibility of the Compton police. But an informant drew a line from Shakurâs fatal shooting to a fight that broke out two months earlier at the Lakewood mall, saying a Mob Piru Blood named Travon Lane was shopping at a Foot Locker when some Southside Crips confronted him and took his Death Row necklace.
After watching Mike Tyson knock out Bruce Seldon at the MGM Grand on the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur and his entourage spotted a lone Southside Crip in the casinoâs lobby, the source told detectives. Lane recognized him as one of the men who stole his necklace and pointed him out to Shakur, who had recently inked âMOBâ on his arm, the informant said.
That Crip was Anderson, according to Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc DiGiacomo, who said Shakurâs entourage launched âa giant beat-down of Mr. Anderson.â
Nearly three decades ago, Tupac Shakur was riding in a BMW driven by Death Row Records boss Marion âSugeâ Knight.
In clips of Kadingâs interviews that were played for the grand jury, Davis said he and his crew sought retaliation for Andersonâs beating by going to Club 662, which was owned by Knight, to wait for Shakur, but they left when the rapper didnât show. Then, while driving away, they saw Shakur stick his head out of a car after some girls yelled his name.
âIf he wouldnât even have been out the window, we would have never seen him,â Davis said.
In subsequent interviews, Davis would repeat his account from the proffer interview and describe how his crew came upon Shakurâs entourage: They hit a U-turn and then âboom boom.â
Davis later bragged how the four men âstarted drinkingâ after they drove away. Two people associated with the Southside Crips testified to the grand jury in August that they believed Smith was the shooter. One said Anderson could not have gotten off the shot from his position in the back seat of the Cadillac.
Prosecutors wouldnât identify the shooter, saying only that Davis handed the gun to one of the two men in the back seat. âA lot of people bragged they shot Tupac; we know the reality,â Kading said.
Under Nevada law, prosecutors need only show that Davis aided and abetted the killing of Shakur. During a July search of his Henderson, Nev., home, investigators seized dozens of photos and other memorabilia related to the hip-hop artistâs slaying.
Since his arrest last month, Davis remains in custody in Nevada.

Man Accused in Tupac Shakur’s Murder Pleads Not Guilty
The suspect, Duane Keith Davis, faces a charge of murder with a deadly weapon. He has spoken openly about his presence at the scene in a memoir and interviews.
Pashtana Usufzy and
Pashtana Usufzy reported from Las Vegas, and Julia Jacobs from New York.
A man who for years has said he was a critical player in the gang-orchestrated shooting of the rapper Tupac Shakur pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a charge of murder with a deadly weapon, following an indictment that thrust the dormant case back into public view.
The man, Duane Keith Davis, known as Keffe D, has spoken and written about how he was inside the vehicle from which shots were fired at Mr. Shakur in 1996.
Wearing a dark blue inmate’s outfit and cuffs on his wrists and ankles, Mr. Davis, 60, looked directly at the judge as he entered his plea, asking for clarification when the prosecutors said they did not plan to ask for the death penalty in the case.
His arraignment had been delayed for weeks because he previously did not have a lawyer to represent him. At Thursday’s hearing, Mr. Davis was represented by the public defender’s office, though he told the judge that he hoped to retain Ross Goodman, a high-profile defense lawyer whose parents have both served as the mayor of Las Vegas.
Two public defenders assigned to Mr. Davis, Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano, declined to comment after the hearing. Mr. Goodman told reporters that he still supported Mr. Davis and hoped to represent him. “There are people who are trying to get the financial resources together to hire me,” Mr. Goodman said.
In a news conference after Mr. Davis’s arrest in September, the police said he had been a leader of the South Side Compton Crips when he directed the shooting of Mr. Shakur after his nephew and fellow gang member, Orlando Anderson, was beaten up by Mr. Shakur and his associates earlier that night. The instigating attack had taken place at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas, where members of two warring gangs — along with some of the top players in gangster rap — had converged on a Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon prizefight.
The investigation into the killing stalled in the years after Mr. Shakur’s death. The police attributed that to a lack of cooperation from witnesses, but some considered it a failure to properly devote resources to solving the murder of a young Black rapper who had risen to the top of his industry by the age of 25.
The killing continued to be a source of intrigue for rap fans and internet sleuths, and Mr. Davis began sharing his account of the events in Las Vegas with filmmakers, YouTube interviewers and readers of his 2019 memoir, “Compton Street Legend.” In the book, Mr. Davis describes obtaining a .40-caliber Glock pistol just before he and a crew of Crips sought revenge for the beating of Mr. Anderson.
It was Mr. Davis’s own words about his involvement that reinvigorated the case, the authorities said. The case against him ramped up in July, when the police searched his home in Henderson, Nev.
Clifford Mogg, a retired homicide detective who started looking into the case in 2018, around the time that Mr. Davis gave his first public interview on the subject, told grand jurors that in the search, investigators recovered Mr. Davis’s cellphone, a copy of his book and two bins of photographs and other materials, including a photo album with news clippings related to Mr. Shakur’s murder.
Mr. Davis, who has spoken publicly about his career in the drug trade in great detail, has been in and out of prison for the past 40 years, in part on federal drug trafficking charges.",N

A knife-wielding man who had just attacked a victim with a machete was fatally shot by Los Angeles police officers outside the popular Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas, police said.
The shooting occurred about 7:40 p.m. Wednesday when police responded to a call about an assault with a deadly weapon in the 23300 block of Avenue San Luis in nearby Woodland Hills, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The gunman was not immediately identified.
The man had allegedly attacked another person with a machete in a McDonaldâs parking lot nearby, police said. The victim was able to disarm the attacker, who then took up a knife.
Responding officers found the man running from the scene with the knife, authorities said.
The man then headed toward the open Sagebrush Cantina restaurant on Calabasas Road. The restaurant was open and had customers inside, police said.
âAs the suspect entered the parking lot area of the restaurant they deployed a taser at the suspect, who was armed with a knife in one hand and a glass bottle in the other hand. The taser appears to have been ineffective,â the LAPD said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The officers said they tried to tase the man a second time but he then moved to the patio of the restaurant.
At one point, the man turned and faced the officers âstill armed with the knife,â police said.
âShortly thereafter, an officer-involved shooting occurred,â police said. âThe suspect was struck by the [officersâ] gunfire.â
The suspected was transported to a local hospital, where he died.
No officers were injured in the incident.
The Sagebrush Cantina, which opened in 1974, is a mainstay of old town Calabasas. The popular Mexican restaurant is located just south of the 101 Freeway and serves thousands of people per week.

Supporters of the extreme right group Golden Dawn defied a blanket police ban on demonstrations in greater Athens late Wednesday and clashed with protesters from a rival rally led by left-wing organizations that also defied the order.
The violence around the center of Athens spilled into a train and onto a platform of the city’s subway system.
2 TURKISH MEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH FATAL SHOOTING OF 6 TURKS IN GREECE
Police initially detained 60 people but later released most of them. The 14 who were arrested face charges of committing public disturbance offenses.
A minister for public order said Thursday that an investigation had been launched into allegations of police brutality after an amateur video posted online appeared to show members of a motorcycle police unit repeatedly punching a detained protester on the ground.
The far-right protest was organized to mark a decade since the fatal shooting of two members of Golden Dawn, a group with Neo-Nazi origins linked to multiple street attacks that mostly targeted migrants.
Golden Dawn once was a political party that was represented in Greece’s parliament between 2012 and 2019. A court declared it a criminal organization in 2020. The group's leader was jailed for 13 years, along with other top members.
AUTHORITIES ARREST 7 AS MANY FEAR GREECE MAY BE TARGETED BY VIOLENT SOCCER SUPPORTERS' GANGS
On Wednesday, police detained 21 Italian nationals at Athens International Airport who allegedly traveled to Greece to attend the far-right rally. They were deported back to Italy, authorities said.
The government denied claims it had relaxed the protest ban.
""There was no tolerance (of the far-right rally). Multiple police operations were carried out,"" government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said.

A gunman shot one person outside the Grove before fleeing the high-end shopping center in a Lamborghini, according to Los Angeles police.
Police were investigating the incident, which was reported at 3:22 p.m. Thursday in the parking lot near Beverly Boulevard and the Grove Drive.
The victim went to a hospital on their own and was later described as stable. Police said the shooter used a handgun, but they had no details of how the shooting occurred. Officers were on their way to the hospital to follow up, a spokesperson said late Thursday afternoon.
The shooter was described as a man with dreadlocks, standing 6 feet tall and wearing a white shirt and black pants. The license plate of the car he was driving was 8WWS816.
A man squatting in Yosemite was sentenced to more than five years in prison on Monday for breaking into a home in Wawona and possessing a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition.
Police were outside the popular shopping destination for more than an hour to investigate the shooting.

Love Letters to California
Readers share why they adore living in the Golden State.
When it comes to waxing poetic about California, certain spots tend to get the most love. Among them: the palm-tree-lined beaches of Los Angeles, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the stunning waterfalls and granite mountains of Yosemite National Park.
But I was struck recently by how many of you sent me charming emails about your love for lesser-known corners of California. You wrote to me about why you adore where you live, from Rancho Mirage to La Mesa to Davis. Your notes were a beautiful show of appreciation for the diversity of experiences of Californians, and I’m happy to share a sampling of them.
Here are some of your notes, lightly edited:
“This morning I opened the blinds in my bedroom and a brown bear was ambling through my yard. Sometimes a bear will stop by my birdbath for a sip of water. I came to Tahoe for a visit over 40 years ago and stayed. I have never tired of its natural beauty.” — Judith Graham, South Lake Tahoe
“Before I moved to Merced from the Santa Barbara region 15 years ago, I had never heard of the Central Valley city. It is like a secret town with secret joys once you get a few minutes away from the freeway: peaceful bike paths along various creeks, a lake that’s terrific for kayaking and sailing, beautiful historical houses and a huge sky for stargazing above the orchards and fields. I can grab a locally made bagel in the morning before work, join the wine-tasting class at one of the wine bars on Main Street in the early evening and then see a live performance at the Merced Theater at night. The people who live here are very friendly, and Merced has a vibrant service organization culture. If you know how to look, there is a lot of ‘gold’ to be found in this community.” — Belinda Braunstein, Merced
“I consider it a badge of honor that I’ve now lived/survived a dozen summers here in Rancho Mirage, in the California desert, including several 120-degree-plus days. A cooler clime is less than an hour escape up the nearby mountains, which I can’t say about the heat and humidity in my native state. In return, I get wonderful weather for most of the rest of the year, the beauty of the desert and mountains and weeks full of fairs, festivals and events. I also have easy access to all that Southern California offers, which I now think would take a lifetime to fully explore. And when it gets hot, I can always jump into a pool with a cold drink nearby. I can’t imagine living anywhere else.” — Jeffrey Clarkson, Rancho Mirage
“I’m an early morning person, so from my ridgetop home in La Mesa I get to watch the sunrise every day. San Diego County mountains are aligned nearly north and south so the location from my perspective changes during the year. In high summer, the sun appears each morning from the southern flank of Cuyamaca Peak, but as the year progresses it reaches as far south as Lawson Peak. I’ve lived in this area since 1969 and I never tire of looking east at the skyline each morning.” — Tom Mooney, La Mesa
“I live in an area of Davis called Village Homes, a community of about 200 families that surrounds a village green. I’ve lived here for the last 11 years since my husband of 42 years died. Village Homes is perfect: with narrow streets, off-the-street parking, few streetlights, and connecting bike and pedestrians paths. The houses are small, the yards are small. I can sit in my living room and watch people of all ages walk by. My immediate neighbors get together for dinners, take care of each others’ yards, collect mail and just in general look out and care for each other. I am so very lucky to live here.” — Kathryn Shack, Davis
“My favorite spot in California is Point Loma — a neighborhood in San Diego. We have lived here for 25 years. There is so much beauty here. I love to run north and then turn west and wow — there’s the ocean. Some days it’s foggy and not as much to see, but many days it’s clear and sunny and so shimmery and beautiful you just feel glad to be alive.” — Laurie Berman, Point Loma, San Diego

Where we’re traveling
Today’s tip comes from Sue Stack, who recommends visiting the Traylor Ranch Nature Reserve and Bird Sanctuary in Penryn, a 30-minute drive northeast of Sacramento:
“I love the Traylor Ranch bird sanctuary. Walking there, a person can see granite outcroppings with holes for acorn-grinding and many native oak trees (the source of the acorns). This relatively small preserve was a cattle ranch in the 1960s and ’70s but is gradually returning to a more ‘natural’ state.”

And before you go, some good news
For those wondering whether your neighborhood is cool as you think it is, Time Out has spoken. And for residents of San Francisco and Los Angeles, you might have been onto something.
Last month, Time Out released its annual list of the 40 coolest neighborhoods in the world, and two California neighborhoods, the Arts District in Los Angeles and the Richmond District in San Francisco, were ranked highly.
The rankings are formulated through a combination of crowdsourcing and editorial selection; this year, the publication received suggestions from more than 12,000 people who nominated neighborhoods in their areas with that special X factor. The selections were then winnowed based on the expertise of editors and locals, and the final rankings were determined by factoring in characteristics like community and access to green space.
Of the 40 chosen, each neighborhood has its own character and shares a strong sense of community, Time Out said. In L.A., the publication commended the Arts District’s craft brewery scene and the vibrant murals that color its oldest building. In San Francisco, the Richmond District’s natural beauty, world-renowned museums and distinctive San Francisco feel put it over the top.
Find out here whether your neighborhood made the cut.

The Signs Were All There. Why Did No One Stop the Maine Shooter?
Shortcomings in mental health treatment, weak laws and a reluctance to threaten personal liberties can derail even concerted attempts to thwart mass shootings.
Shaila Dewan, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and
Shaila Dewan, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Chelsia Rose Marcius are reporting on the mass shooting in Lewiston and on the gunman who carried out the massacre. They welcome information through nytimes.com/tips.
Robert Card displayed a textbook set of warning signs: He was hearing voices. He told people that he was planning violence. And his behavior had markedly changed in the months leading up to the mass shooting he carried out last week.
His family, his superiors in the military and the local police knew all of this. Yet no one stopped him.
His killing of 18 people with an assault-style rifle in Lewiston, Maine, points to how shortcomings in the mental health system, weak laws and a reluctance to threaten personal liberties can derail even concerted attempts to thwart violence in a country awash in guns.
“So often I think we’re talking about how to get people on the radar,” said Jillian Peterson, the executive director of the Violence Project, which studies mass shooting perpetrators. “And in this case, he was on the radar of a lot of different systems, and they still couldn’t get him intervention.”
Police records, including the accounts of family members and colleagues in his Army Reserve unit — one of whom sent an anguished late-night text message to his supervisor six weeks before the shooting — show that Mr. Card’s friends and relatives had grown increasingly alarmed about his mental condition.
But even as they communicated with each other and law enforcement, even as he was confronted and hospitalized and had a sheriff’s deputy come knocking, nothing went far enough.
J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and F.B.I. consultant on mass shooting prevention, said that Mr. Card received “a Band-Aid treatment” for a gravely serious condition.
“When you have multiple jurisdictions, where there’s a siloing effect, you increase risk of failure,” he said.
After the shooting, Mr. Card’s siblings told the police that their brother had been in a relationship with a woman he met at a cornhole competition at Schemengees Bar & Grille — the bar that he later attacked — and became delusional in February after they had a “bad breakup,” according to affidavits released on Tuesday by the Maine State Police.
Mr. Card’s sister, Nicole Herling, said that he had been prescribed medication but stopped taking it, according to the police affidavit.
He wrongly believed that several businesses in the area, including the two that he attacked, were broadcasting online that he was a pedophile, she said.
Ryan Card told a police officer that he had tried to help his brother but that he “could not be reasoned with,” according to the affidavit.
The first public record of family members notifying law enforcement of their concerns came in May, when Mr. Card’s teenage son and ex-wife reported that he had become paranoid and angry, and had picked up 10 to 15 guns from his brother’s house.
A Sagadahoc County sheriff’s deputy, Chad Carleton, began an ad hoc intervention process, trading information with both Mr. Card’s Army Reserve command, which said it knew about his problems but not their severity, and his brother, who had witnessed Robert drinking heavily and making “angry rants about having to shoot someone.”
Despite those threats, Deputy Carleton told Ryan Card to reach out in the future if he thought his brother was a danger to himself or others, implying that the department would then take action.
Dr. Peterson and other experts on mass shootings say that this is a common misstep. Somewhere from 60 to 90 percent of perpetrators “leak” their plans to other people in advance. But people either do not take them seriously enough, or allow the person who made the threat to convince them that it is not genuine.
“He literally said, ‘I am a danger to others. I want to go shoot this place.’ So that should be enough to escalate it,” Dr. Peterson said.
Instead, Mr. Card’s siblings visited him. He answered the door with a gun in hand but agreed to see a doctor about the paranoia and voices, according to Deputy Carleton’s report.
Neither Deputy Carleton nor Mr. Card’s relatives have responded to requests for interviews. Sheriff Joel Merry of Sagadahoc County said in a statement that he believed his agency had “acted appropriately and followed procedures,” but would evaluate its policies to look for improvements.
Gov. Janet Mills of Maine announced on Wednesday that she would create an independent commission to probe “the facts of what happened on that tragic night, of the months that led up to it, and of the police response to it.”
The Army Reserve’s plan in May was “to sit down with Robert in the near future and see if they could get him to open up about what has been going on,” according to the deputy’s report. Asked for comment, a spokesman said the Army was continuing to investigate Mr. Card’s service record.
It is not clear how either plan played out. But it is clear that Mr. Card’s son and ex-wife had grown afraid of him. They did not want him to know that they had gone to the authorities, and sought to keep their involvement confidential.
Experts said that a stigma against “snitching” or fear of retribution could make people hesitant to inform the authorities, or go back to them a second or third time when someone needed help.
Dr. Meloy said that family members had legitimate fears: “They need to alert the police; on the other hand, alerting the police — and then a paranoid individual finding out about that — can bring a blowback.”
In July, Mr. Card came to the attention of the authorities again, when he attended annual training at Camp Smith in New York with his Army Reserve unit. There, according to police records, Mr. Card accused three soldiers of calling him a pedophile, shoved one of them and locked himself in his room.
Mr. Card was taken to a medical treatment facility at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, and from there to a civilian psychiatric hospital in New York, called Four Winds, where he stayed for 14 days.
But the system to treat people who resist getting help on their own is geared toward acute, not long-term, problems. Involuntary stays require an imminent threat of harm and generally last from 72 hours to two weeks.
After Mr. Card’s discharge from the hospital, the Army directed that he not have access to military weapons or participate in live-fire activities, and declared him to be “non-deployable.” Reserve medical personnel made multiple attempts to contact Mr. Card over the next few months, according to a statement from the Army.
The Army’s decisions affected only what happened when Mr. Card was on duty. But reservists like him are rarely on duty, so commanders are limited to alerting civilian authorities with whom they may be unfamiliar, said Michael Aschinger, a retired Army Reserve sergeant major.
That left the local police with two legal options. They used neither.
First, an involuntary psychiatric commitment should have made it illegal under federal law for Mr. Card to possess guns. Neither the Army nor the hospital would say whether his stay at Four Winds was forced, but there are several indications that it was, including the fact that just two days after he returned home, he wrote on a gun purchase form that he had been committed. (The form does not specify, but the federal law that question is based on does not apply to voluntary commitment.)
Any involuntary commitment should have been reported to a national database that would have prevented Mr. Card from passing the background check required to buy guns from a licensed dealer. Officials have said that Mr. Card’s name was not in the database, and that he purchased guns legally after his hospital stay.
Regardless, Mr. Card could have evaded a background check by purchasing a gun from a private dealer. And although the law prohibits people who have been committed from possessing guns, there is no automatic mechanism for removing guns they already own.
The local sheriff’s office was notified of Mr. Card’s hospitalization after another jarring incident in September, but apparently did not pursue it as a possible avenue to take away his guns.
By that point, the warning signs could not have been more clear.
During a car ride in mid-September, Mr. Card punched a fellow soldier and threatened to “shoot up” the Army Reserve facility in Saco, Maine, and other places. The soldier texted a superior officer at 2 a.m., according to a copy of the messages obtained by The New York Times, warning him to change the passcode to the unit’s gate at their base and be armed in case Mr. Card approached.
“I believe he’s messed up in the head,” the soldier, identified as Staff Sergeant Hodgson, wrote, adding that he loved Mr. Card “to death” but “I do not know how to help him and he refuses to get help or to continue help.”
“I believe he’s going to snap and do a mass shooting,” he wrote.
A copy of the text message was included in a letter that Kelvin Mote, a first sergeant in the Reserve and a corporal in the Ellsworth Police Department in Maine, sent to the sheriff’s office in mid-September, detailing the incidents at annual training, hospitalization and car ride.
Deputies could have also sought to use Maine’s “yellow flag” law, which allows the police to remove someone’s guns for up to a year if that person presents “a likelihood of foreseeable harm.” The law went into effect in 2020 and has been used 81 times, but never by the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office, according to state records.
All law enforcement officers in the state receive training on how to use the law, which requires them to take the individual into protective custody, arrange a medical evaluation and present the results to a judge.
The law is more burdensome than “red flag” laws in other states, which do not require taking people into custody and evaluating them.
When the Sheriff’s Office received the Army report in mid-September, Sgt. Aaron Skolfield went to do a welfare check but did not find Mr. Card.
Instead, Sergeant Skolfield worked with Ryan Card, who said he and his father had come up with a way to secure Mr. Card’s weapons.
But it never happened. Ryan said his brother had allowed him to change the code on his gun safe for “a period of time” a few months ago, according to a police affidavit. But Robert Card, it said, still “had access to his firearms prior to the shootings.”

- Davis, 60, faces life in prison if convicted of the high-profile killing.
- Davis was arrested last month in Henderson, Nevada, a Las Vegas suburb, in connection with Shakur's murder.
A former Southern California street gang leader pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder in the 1996 killing of rap music icon Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas — a charge prompted by his own descriptions in recent years about orchestrating the deadly drive-by shooting.
Duane Keith ""Keffe D"" Davis is the only person still alive who was in the vehicle from which shots were fired and the only person ever charged with a crime in the case. In court on Thursday, Davis stood in shackles as he awaited proceedings and waved to his wife, son and daughter in the packed spectator gallery.
""Not guilty,"" Davis said when Clark County District Court Judge Tierra Jones asked for his plea.
TUPAC SHAKUR MURDER SUSPECT MAY NOT HAVE LEGAL COUNSEL FOR UPCOMING ARRAIGNMENT
The judge told Davis that prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty in the case, which could put Davis in prison for the rest of his life if he is convicted. Jones also named county special public defenders Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano to represent Davis at taxpayer expense, after Davis lost his bid to hire private defense attorney Ross Goodman.
Goodman two weeks ago said prosecutors lack witnesses and key evidence, including a gun or vehicle, for the killing committed 27 years ago. Outside the courtroom on Thursday, Goodman said Davis was still trying to hire him. Davis' family members declined to comment.
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told reporters that he and a panel of prosecutors decided the case against Davis was ""not the kind of case that should proceed with the asking of the death penalty."" He didn't specify reasons for that decision.
Wolfson also declined to respond to Goodman's criticism of the evidence, saying that a jury will weigh the results of the police investigation.
In court, Davis wore dark-blue jail garb and answered several questions, telling the judge that he attended ""a year in college,"" wasn't under the influence of drugs, medication or alcohol, and he understood he is charged with murder. The judge set his next court date for Tuesday to schedule the trial.
Davis, 60, is originally from Compton, California. He was arrested Sept. 29 outside a home in suburban Henderson where Las Vegas police served a search warrant July 17, drawing renewed attention to one of hip-hop music’s most enduring mysteries. Davis remains jailed without bail, did not testify before the grand jury that indicted him, and declined from jail to speak with The Associated Press.
The indictment alleges Davis obtained and provided a gun to someone in the back seat of a Cadillac before the car-to-car gunfire that mortally wounded Shakur and wounded rap music mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight at an intersection just off the Las Vegas Strip. Shakur died a week later. He was 25.
Knight, now 58, is in prison in California, serving a 28-year sentence for the death of a Compton businessman in 2015. He has not responded to messages through his attorneys seeking comment about Davis’ arrest.
Prosecutors allege that Shakur's killing in Las Vegas came out of competition between East Coast members of a Bloods gang sect and West Coast groups of a Crips sect, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre dubbed ""gangsta rap.""
The grand jury was told the Sept. 7, 1996 shooting in Las Vegas was retaliation for a brawl hours earlier at a Las Vegas Strip casino involving Shakur and Davis’ nephew, Orlando ""Baby Lane"" Anderson.
NEW BODYCAM VIDEO SHOWS TUPAC SHAKUR MURDER SUSPECT HYPING HIS ALLEGED CRIME
Prosecutors told a grand jury that Davis implicated himself in the killing in multiple interviews and a 2019 tell-all memoir that described his life leading a Crips sect in Compton. Davis has said he obtained a .40-caliber handgun and handed it to Anderson, a member of Davis’ gang, in the back seat of a Cadillac, though he didn’t identify Anderson as the shooter.
Anderson, then 22, denied involvement in Shakur’s killing and died two years later in a shooting in his hometown of Compton. The other back seat passenger and the driver of the Cadillac are also dead.
In his book, Davis wrote that he told authorities in 2010 what he knew of the killings of Shakur and gang rival Notorious B.I.G, whose legal name is Christopher Wallace, to protect himself and 48 of his Southside Compton Crips gang associates from prosecution and the possibility of life sentences in prison.
Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls, was shot and killed in Los Angeles in March 1997, six months after Shakur’s death.

Family: Why have there been no charges in shooting that killed Chicago assistant principal?,2023-11-02,2023-11-04T03:00:02Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/family-why-no-shooting-chicago-assistant-principal/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104030002id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/family-why-no-shooting-chicago-assistant-principal/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104030002/https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/family-why-no-shooting-chicago-assistant-principal/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL2NoaWNhZ28vbmV3cy9mYW1pbHktd2h5LW5vLXNob290aW5nLWNoaWNhZ28tYXNzaXN0YW50LXByaW5jaXBhbA~~,"Family: Why have there been no charges in shooting that killed Chicago assistant principal?
CHICAGO (CBS) -- It has been nearly two months since a Chicago assistant school principal was shot and killed in his downtown condo building.
No charges have been filed in the death of 32-year-old Abnerd Joseph, and his family is now asking why.
As CBS 2's Charlie De Mar reported Thursday night, a fellow resident at the condo building was brought in by police for questioning. But the 45-year-old licensed gun owner was later released.
Now, Joseph's family is pushing for accountability.
""We, as Abnerd's family, we're demanding the truth into what happened into Abnerd Joseph,"" said Joseph's brother, Jay Charles.
Joseph lived in The Legacy at Millennium Park condos, at 60 E. Monroe St. just off Michigan Avenue. Across the street on Thursday, a family and community demanded answers on why the beloved assistant high school principal was shot and killed inside his condo building by another resident.
""We still haven't got any answers into how my brother got murdered; why he got murdered,"" said Charles.
""Why did this person feel like death was the only answer for my brother?"" added another brother, Bryan Bienaime.
Joseph joined Intrinsic High School Downtown, 79 W. Monroe St., in 2022. He previously taught in Atlanta, and was a graduate of Florida State University.
Shanekah Polk's daughter attends Intrinsic.
""He only spoke positively. He smiled,"" Polk said. ""He was very enthusiastic and exuberant about the children. He had such a positive attitude.""
Chicago Police were called to the building a little after 7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 14 - where they found Joseph on the 48th floor with several gunshot wounds. Family says he lived on the 29th floor.
It's unclear what led to the shooting. But according to the police report, Joseph was seen pounding on doors and was asked to stop by several residents. Joseph allegedly struck the doorman and another tenant.
Sources told CBS 2 the shooter, also a resident and licensed concealed carry holder, revealed he had a gun and shot Joseph several times.
""If there was any kind of disturbance, that's what the city of Chicago has 911 for,"" said community activist Justin Blake.
""That sounds completely out of character,"" added Bienaime. ""My brother was not a violent person.""
The Chicago Police Department says its investigation into the case is still ongoing. Meanwhile, Joseph's family has obtained an attorney to try to track down some of those answers to their questions.
The mother of a woman killed in a crash on DuSable Lake Shore Drive wants answers.
Jaida Victoria Rosado-Colon was a passenger in a car when another vehicle heading on Monday evening, when another vehicle headed south on the Drive cut them off near 31st Street.
Rosado-Colon's vehicle veered off the road, hit a tree, and burst into flames. She and her 24-year-old friend were killed.
Rosado-Colon's mother told us her daughter had just started her firs year teaching sixth-grade science, and enjoyed seeing everyone happy.
The family is looking for clarity into the crash.

"Illinois assault-style weapons registration is open, but questions remain about enforcement, other issues",2023-11-02,2023-11-04T04:52:11Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/illinois-assault-style-weapons-registration-open-questions/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104045211id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/illinois-assault-style-weapons-registration-open-questions/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104045211/https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/illinois-assault-style-weapons-registration-open-questions/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL2NoaWNhZ28vbmV3cy9pbGxpbm9pcy1hc3NhdWx0LXN0eWxlLXdlYXBvbnMtcmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uLW9wZW4tcXVlc3Rpb25z,"Illinois assault-style weapons registration is open, but questions remain about enforcement, other issues
CHICAGO (CBS) -- It has been one month since Illinois State Police opened up registration for assault-style weapons - as is now required by Illinois law.
As CBS 2 Investigator Megan Hickey reported Thursday night, there is still plenty of confusion about who needs to register - and just how the new law will be enforced. There are also real concerns about whether those questions will be answered in time for the Jan. 1 registration deadline.
The law says that people who already owned assault-style weapons before the ban took effect are allowed to keep them, as long as they register them before Jan. 1, 2024. But gun owners Thursday said they only have had some of their questions answered - and pending legal challenges could change everything.
A public hearing was held Thursday on the Protect Illinois Communities Act assault weapons registration requirement.
A familiar response from Illinois State Police legal counsel Suzanne Bond was, ""We are committed to hearing your concerns and doing what we can.""
The meeting Thursday was the first of three across the state to try to resolve confusion over the law and what it means.
Illinois state Rep. Brad Halbrook (R-Shelbyville) said at the meeting that many questions remain – including what the penalty is for not registering.
""Nearly every day, we get email or some level of communication from constituents about it,"" said Halbrook, whose downstate district is located east and southeast of Springfield and also includes Taylorville and Effingham.
Halbrook said he was surprised to hear Illinois State Police defer many of the questions about specific penalties - and how state police will go about enforcing the registration requirement to prosecutors at the county level.
Bond said at the meeting, ""It will be up to each individual state's attorney in the 102 counties to decide how they will enforce that.""
""So if that's the case, there's going to be somewhere between 90 and 100 counties that I don't think there'll be any prosecutions - unless there's a much bigger case to be had there,"" Halbrook told CBS 2.
State Police couldn't answer questions about what happens if legal challenges to the law are successful.
ISP was also peppered at the meeting with plenty of technical questions about which weapons fall into the assault weapons category.
Josh Witkowski of the Illinois Federation for Outdoor Resources wondered if the standard would be that a weapon would qualify as an assault weapon ""unless the firearm magically appears in a field, and they use it only in the field for hunting.""
We've learned that since Oct. 1, 2,430 gun owners have disclosed their assault style guns, accessories, and ammunition.
We don't know how many assault style weapons are out there and left be accounted for — but we do know a total of 2,415,481 million Illinois residents have Firearm Owners Identification Cards.
""I think a message at the end of the day is, I believe, hundreds of thousands of law-abiding citizens are just not going to comply with this law,"" said Halbrook. ""I think it's going to be a problem for the governor and the ISP, and ultimately the legislature, to sort out.
Illinois State Police said they hope to have answers to some of the unanswered questions by the December meeting of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, which is just about a month from that Jan. 1 registration deadline.
State lawmakers approved assault-style weapons the ban in early January, and Gov. JB Pritzker quickly signed it into law. Before signing the bill, Pritzker invoked the memory of the July 4th parade mass shooting in Highland Park last year – which left seven people dead and 36 injured, and left a 2-year-old boy parentless and wandering around.
The shooter used a legally-purchased semiautomatic weapon.
In August, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled to allow the state's assault weapons ban to stay in place following a 4-3 decision.

KCAL Investigates: Stabbing that went unreported for hours raises concerns about school safety,2023-11-02,2023-11-04T03:03:32Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/kcal-investigates-stabbing-that-went-unreported-for-hoursraises-concerns-about-school-safety/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104030332id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/kcal-investigates-stabbing-that-went-unreported-for-hoursraises-concerns-about-school-safety/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231104030332/https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/kcal-investigates-stabbing-that-went-unreported-for-hoursraises-concerns-about-school-safety/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMvbmV3cy9rY2FsLWludmVzdGlnYXRlcy1zdGFiYmluZy10aGF0LXdlbnQtdW5yZXBvcnRlZC1mb3ItaG91cnNyYWlzZXMtY29uY2VybnMtYWJvdXQtc2Nob29sLXNhZmV0eQ~~,"KCAL Investigates: Stabbing that went unreported for hours raises concerns about school safety
The recent rash of violence at Van Nuys High, where two students were stabbed on Wednesday, has placed safety within the Los Angeles Unified School District at the top of many minds this fall.
However, at yet another LAUSD school, there was another stabbing and how that one was dealt with is also causing concern.
The principal of the school, politician overseeing the district and police chief have all been reluctant or refused to speak to KCAL News after this stabbing was caught on the first day of class.
Some sources have told KCAL News that this stabbing went unreported for nearly an entire day — neither school police nor LAUSD police were called right away.
It began on the first day of class during a lunchtime brawl at Polytechnic Senior High School that was caught on camera. In the confusion of the punching and kicking, a student was stabbed. Moments later, in the video, you can see something witnesses say was possibly a screwdriver in another student's hand.
However, despite it happening on campus, the video and five stab wounds — one at least two inches long — the victim's mother was further hurt after she said no one immediately called police.
""I was thinking of going to the police station, but I didn't have the name,"" the mother said in Spanish. ""They didn't want to give me the name. I couldn't do anything. So, I had to wait until the next day.""
She said police were called nearly 24 hours later.
""I wanted to report it the first day, but they told me that they had to investigate to see which boy it was that was carrying the weapon,"" the mother said.
Even though the victim's injuries were not life-threatening, more than 20 years of school police experience tells Officer Gil Gamez this was deadly serious.
""Immediately, it should've been reported,"" said Gamez. ""You had a victim of a crime.""
Gamez said the apparent lack of officers, adults or supervision is a significant issue.
""I'd be outraged,"" he said. ""Of course, it could've been worse. Of course, they could've been killed.""
When KCAL News asked Polytechnic's principal, Walter Rich, he referred us to his operations team and did not answer any questions.
Additionally, our call to LAUSD was not immediately returned, leading Gamez to believe there may have been a cover-up.
LAUSD's reporting of public information has been generally lacking, too. It took KCAL News months to uncover crime data from 2021 through December 2022. However, the information obtained showed six assaults with a deadly weapon, eighter batteries and two fighting calls, all at Polytechnic Senior High.
Now, more than a year later, the district has still failed to produce the complete records of those incidents. When KCAL News' attorney pointed out that LAUSD completely ignored its own deadline, the district responded by giving us a new, even later, deadline.
We've brought this issue to Superintendent Alberto Carvalho on other requests.
""Anything that's publicly available should be made,"" said Carvalho.
However, the district has not released LAUSD's current crime data, which we requested nearly two months ago. But, according to new public statements, on-campus crime has almost doubled.
""Actually, pretty significant, almost a 200% increase in crimes on campus,"" said LAUSD Police Chief Steven Zipperman.
The police chief had little to say about campus crime rising, as well as the allegations of a cover-up.
""I'm aware of an incident that happened on that campus,"" said Zipperman. ""I am not privy to how long it took them to call.""
Regarding the allegation that it took about 24 hours to inform police, he said:
""I'm sure if that's the case that it will be handled by school administration for proper training.""
He added that ""it should be concerning for anybody.""
In just the past few months, we've uncovered a brutal fight, shooting and stabbing that happened during the first months of this school year in Board Member Kelly Gonez's district. Her district has had the most fighting and physical aggression, with 118 incidents, according to LAUSD's data.
""I'm not supportive of schools' ability to opt-in to have a police presence on campus,"" said Gonez.
This happened after Gonez helped defund school police, cutting its budget by nearly 20% and its officers by 33%.
""This is a direct result because of this,"" said Gamez.
Gonez also appeared to have difficulty acknowledging the problem when confronted by parents. Now, they want more help protecting their children and solving this problem.
""I don't like the school. It's not safe,"" said the Polytechnic High victim. ""I want the police to come back.""
The police union, which officer Gil Gamez speaks for, also wants officers permanently back on campus. They believe this stabbing may have been prevented or could have been mitigated if there was an officer there at that school.
We gave Chief Zipperman, Superintendent Carvalho, Board Member Kelly Gonez and the entire district several opportunities to speak with us. Still, none of them would sit down and answer our questions — or parents' questions on camera.
When asked, LAUSD spokesperson Shannon Haber didn't give us a single example of when Carvalho has spoken publicly about the rise in crime. However, she did send KCAL News a vague statement about how the District takes ""immediate steps"" to address incidents, but she did not answer any of our specific questions.
""We are disturbed by any act of violence that impacts our school communities and we recognize that the safety of our students relies on a collaborative approach among the District, our schools, local law enforcement, community organizations and families. Los Angeles Unified remains steadfast in our commitment to promote the safety of our students on campus and in our school communities,"" Haber said in the statement.
Haber added that the District immediately meets with school and law enforcement officials to help communities affected by violence.
""When conflict arises between students, the school engages in restorative practices to foster mutual respect and understanding. When appropriate, the school may also implement the District's discipline procedures, which may include other means of correction, suspension and expulsion,"" she added.
If any incident happens off-campus, the district claims that they continue their collaborative relationship with law enforcement and community leaders to help protect students.
After the recent stabbing at Van Nuys High School, Carvalho said schools can now temporarily request police. However, the union said those temporary requests have always been an option that doesn't really address the serious issue.

Police are investigating a shooting near the Grove.
Officers responded to the popular shopping destination at about 3:30 p.m. after someone reported a gunshot victim in the parking lot. The Los Angeles Police Department said they did not locate the victim but believe they left the scene.
They later updated the crime scene location to a nearby intersection on The Grove Drive and Beverly Boulevard.
Investigators have not located a suspect either. They believe the shooter may be driving a black Lamborghini.

Death of a Codebreaker
BBC Sounds, from Tuesday
In 2010, Gareth Williams – a Welsh maths genius who worked as a codebreaker for GCHQ, MI6 and the intelligence services – was found dead inside a fingerprint-free bag in his London flat’s bathtub. In this forensic six-part podcast, Dr Sian Williams unpicks the unsolved case, but will she be able to get any real answers? Hollie Richardson
There’s a podcast for that
This week, Robyn Vinter chooses five of the best podcasts that actually solved crimes, from a podcast that delivered justice for a missing teenager to the unmasking of an online paedophile network
Hunting Warhead
This masterful Canadian-Norwegian podcast is as haunting and thoroughly gripping as they come. Years in the making, the CBC co-production with the newspaper VG, attempts to track down and identify “Warhead”, the mastermind of the largest global paedophile network on the dark web. But not everything is as it seems. Somewhere in the middle, undercover journalists bump into undercover cops and the podcast takes a turn, showing the grim (and sometimes morally complicated) but necessary work carried out by those tasked with investigating this type of crime. It is a twisty ride containing heartbreaking human moments and culminating in a satisfying ending that leaves no loose ends untied.
Bear Brook
This quality investigation begins less as a whodunnit and more as a “who are they”, looking at the case of a woman and three girls whose remains were found in sealed oil drums in Bear Brook, New Hampshire, US. The bodies, dating back to the late 70s or early 80s, belong to unknown victims – who had tragically never been reported missing. Highly focussed on the detail of forensics and genealogy, Bear Brook sensitively puts together the pieces with the help of experts in those fields. By the end of the podcast, we know not only who those victims are but who carried out the savage murders.
Proof.
Proof. is a podcast that is not about getting justice for a victim, instead looking at those convicted, in this case for the 1996 shooting of Brian Bowling. The dead 15-year-old’s family believed his best friend, Josh Storey, conspired with a second teen named Lee Clark to murder Bowling, and both were serving prison sentences for murder at the start of the podcast. By the end, everything is turned on its head.
Your Own Backyard
Podcaster Chris Lambert had spent a large part of his life passing a billboard in his hometown featuring the image of Kristin Smart, a 19-year-old woman who went missing in 1996. A musician and sound engineer, Lambert was not the most likely true crime podcaster, and an even less likely detective, but the absence of justice had bothered him enough to make a remarkable documentary that would go on to solve the crime. His persistence with a case that had long since run cold and his real life connections with people in the town led to the conviction of a man for Smart’s murder earlier this year.
Bible John: Creation of a Serial Killer
The haunting figure of the mysterious Bible John, a serial killer who slaughtered three women in the late 60s, is still lingering over the city of Glasgow. This absorbing and atmospheric podcast is hosted by journalist Audrey Gillan, who first covered the murders in 1996 when the body of a man was exhumed to determine whether his DNA matched that of the murderous spectre. Gillan picks up where she left off in the 90s, this time examining the culture of misogyny that likely caused key information to be covered up. Evidence uncovered in his BBC Scotland podcast led to a recent reopening of the case, with the sense there may be still some long overdue restitution for the families of the women.

At the season’s last football game, between rival high schools in Lewiston and Auburn, two broken cities in Maine found joy again.
Supported by
Reporting from Lewiston, Maine
The Battle of the Bridge is the biggest football game of the year in Lewiston and Auburn, cities separated by a river in Maine.
The high schools — Lewiston High and Edward Little — are bitter rivals. On the eve of the game, the last of the year, seniors burn a pair of cleats in a moving-on ceremony. Players wear ties to class. There’s a parade. It’s like homecoming, squared.
But Wednesday night was different. Kickoff, at 6 p.m., came almost exactly a week after a gunman began a shooting spree that killed 18 people and wounded 13 others. And in the two-day lockdown that followed, Lewiston High became a command center. Helicopters landed on the grass fields, and police officers met in the school buildings to plan their search for the gunman.
The game, originally scheduled for last week, was a return to routine for the cities after the state’s deadliest mass shooting. It was a chance to celebrate in the open after days of sheltering in place during a terrifying manhunt.
“Long after this game is over, no one is going to remember the score,” said Jason Versey, the Lewiston football coach. “People are going to remember that we came together.”
As players on both teams stretched and dabbed eye black on their cheeks, they were thinking about more than just football. They would play hard, as always. But they weren’t playing only to win.
“It’s definitely more than a game,” said Jeffrey Randall, 16, Lewiston’s starting quarterback. “I see it as the community coming together.”
As the sun set behind the Lewiston bleachers and the field glowed orange, team parents grilled hot dogs as groups of girls teased one another about their crushes. There were pompoms and pep talks as fans yelled themselves hoarse from the stands. From a distance, a normal football game, on a normal Maine autumn night.
But players on both teams knew people who had been shot, or had family who had spent the week on a ventilator. Parents of players lost friends. Everyone knew someone — or knew someone who knew someone. It’s that kind of place.
“I don’t know what normal is going to look like moving forward,” said Jason Fuller, Lewiston’s athletic director, choking back tears. “But this is a step.”
Usually, the players are the stars and take the field first. But this time, they lined up along a walkway — Lewiston on one side, Edward Little on the other — as first responders walked through. Police department after police department walked with firefighters and medical personnel, as players and their fans clapped and clapped, cheering for friends.
After a ceremony honoring the first responders and acknowledging the people who were killed, James Taylor, the Boston-born, Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, walked to midfield with his guitar. He sang the national anthem as players from both teams stood shoulder to shoulder.
An American flag flew at half-staff. Fans removed their Patriots caps, their eyes wet, their hands over their hearts, their community around them.
Posters with the names of the people who were killed lined the fence behind the end zone.
“We don’t have anything to rally against, so much as we have to rally together,” said Brian DuBois, 53, watching his 16-year-old son, Ben DuBois, make catch after catch for Edward Little.
Beneath the weight of the past week, both teams wanted to win the game. A victory would send Lewiston to the playoffs, and Edward Little hadn’t won a game all year.
At halftime, Edward Little was up 12 to 6. The teams regrouped, strategized and warmed up. Within minutes, Lewiston scored in the third quarter. Then, Lewiston scored again. The cheerleaders picked up the pep as the student section, completely outfitted in blue, got on the bleachers to scream.
“Bringing everyone together gave everyone a little bit of a push to start healing,” said Allie Pineau, 16, a Lewiston cheerleader, gripping hand warmers beneath her pompoms.
Her father, the deputy fire chief in nearby Topsham, spent that first tense night helping colleagues respond to the shootings. She’s still finding her footing again — confetti poppers set her off.
“This is not something that is just going to pass,” Ms. Pineau said. But going back to school, going back to work, is important, she said. “Getting into a routine again will really help people heal.”
Torey Weldon, the cheer coach, knows that fear firsthand. Her husband is a firefighter. Last Wednesday, he texted her to tell her that there was an active shooter. “Please lock the doors. Love you.” Seven days later she was watching her team on the sidelines.
“This is their way of saying like, ‘You don’t break us,’” said Ms. Weldon, 28, adding, “It’s somehow the universe knew our cities needed this.”
By the last few minutes of the game, Lewiston was 16 points ahead, too far for Edward Little to catch up. In the last few seconds, Mr. Randall, the quarterback, took a knee. He wanted to let the clock run down without trying to run up the score.
He dropped down on the 18-yard line, for the 18 victims, as Lewiston fans cheered around him.

Suspect in 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur pleads not guilty,2023-11-02,2023-11-03T02:47:58Z,en,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/02/tupac-shakur-murder-las-vegas-nevada,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103024758id_/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/02/tupac-shakur-murder-las-vegas-nevada,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103024758/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/02/tupac-shakur-murder-las-vegas-nevada,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHRoZWd1YXJkaWFuKS9tdXNpYy8yMDIzL25vdi8wMi90dXBhYy1zaGFrdXItbXVyZGVyLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1uZXZhZGE~,"A former southern California street gang leader pleaded not guilty on Thursday to orchestrating a drive-by shooting that killed Tupac Shakur in 1996 in Las Vegas.
Duane Keith “Keffe D” Davis, the only person still alive who was in the car from which shots were fired and the only person ever charged with a crime in the case, stood in shackles before the Clark county district judge Tierra Jones.
Special public defenders Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano represented Davis in court on Thursday. On Wednesday, Davis lost his bid to hire Ross Goodman as his defense attorney. Two weeks ago, Goodman had said prosecutors lacked witnesses and key evidence, including a gun or vehicle, from the killing 27 years ago.
Before entering his plea, Davis stood in dark-blue jail garb and answered a short series of questions, telling the judge that he had attended “a year in college”, was not under the influence of any drugs, medication or alcohol, and that he understood he had been charged with murder.
Davis, 60, is from Compton, California. He was arrested on 29 September outside a home in suburban Henderson, Nevada, where Las Vegas police had served a search warrant on 17 July, drawing renewed attention to one of hip-hop music’s most enduring mysteries. Davis remains jailed without bail, did not testify before the grand jury that indicted him, and declined from jail to speak with the Associated Press.
The indictment alleges Davis obtained a gun and provided it to someone in the back seat of a Cadillac before the car-to-car gunfire that mortally wounded Shakur and wounded rap music mogul Marion “Suge” Knight at an intersection just off the Las Vegas Strip. Shakur died a week later. He was 25.
Knight, now 58, is in prison in California, serving a 28-year sentence for the murder of a Compton businessman in 2015. He has not responded to messages through his attorneys seeking comment about Davis’s arrest.
Prosecutors allege that Shakur’s killing in Las Vegas was the result of competition between east coast members of a Bloods gang sect and west coast groups of a Crips sect, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre dubbed “gangsta rap”.
The grand jury was told the 7 September 1996 shooting in Las Vegas was retaliation for a brawl hours earlier at a Las Vegas Strip casino involving Shakur and Davis’s nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson.
Prosecutors told a grand jury that Davis implicated himself in the killing in multiple interviews and a 2019 tell-all memoir that described his life leading a Crips sect in Compton. Davis has said he obtained a .40-caliber handgun and handed it to Anderson, a member of Davis’s gang, in the back seat of a Cadillac, though he did not identify Anderson as the shooter.
Anderson, then 22, denied involvement in Shakur’s killing and died two years later in a shooting in his home town of Compton. The other back seat passenger and the driver of the Cadillac are also dead.
In his book, Davis wrote that he told authorities in 2010 what he knew of the killings of Shakur and gang rival Notorious BIG, whose legal name was Christopher Wallace, to protect himself and 48 of his Southside Compton Crips gang associates from prosecution and the possibility of life sentences in prison.
Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls, was shot and killed in Los Angeles in March 1997, six months after Shakur’s death.
Shakur is largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time. He had five No 1 albums, was nominated for six Grammy awards, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, and received a posthumous star this year on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",N
"Video captures final screams of pro cyclist Mo Wilson after accused killer Kaitlin Armstrong tracked her on fitness app, prosecutor says",2023-11-02,2023-11-03T03:31:22Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kaitlin-armstrong-trial-video-captures-final-screams-pro-cyclist-mo-wilson-prosecutor-says/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103033122id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kaitlin-armstrong-trial-video-captures-final-screams-pro-cyclist-mo-wilson-prosecutor-says/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103033122/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kaitlin-armstrong-trial-video-captures-final-screams-pro-cyclist-mo-wilson-prosecutor-says/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL25ld3Mva2FpdGxpbi1hcm1zdHJvbmctdHJpYWwtdmlkZW8tY2FwdHVyZXMtZmluYWwtc2NyZWFtcy1wcm8tY3ljbGlzdC1tby13aWxzb24tcHJvc2VjdXRvci1zYXlz,"Video captures final screams of pro cyclist Mo Wilson after accused killer Kaitlin Armstrong tracked her on fitness app, prosecutor says
The murder trial of a woman accused of gunning down rising pro cyclist Anna Moriah Wilson and fleeing the country began Wednesday with Texas prosecutors telling jurors they would hear Wilson's final screams and the shots that killed her.
Kaitlin Armstrong, 35, has pleaded not guilty to murder and faces up to 99 years in prison in the May 2022 slaying of Wilson, a competitive gravel and mountain bike racer. Wilson had been shot in the head and chest when she was found at a friend's home before a race that she was among the favorites to win.
""The last thing Mo did on this earth was scream in terror,"" Travis County prosecutor Rickey Jones told jurors in opening statements.
He said nearby surveillance equipment captured the screams.
""Those screams are followed by 'Pop! Pop!'"" Jones said, smacking his hands together for emphasis. ""You won't hear any more screams after that.""
Seconds after those shots, Jones said, ""Kaitlin Armstrong stood over Mo Wilson and put a third shot right into Mo Wilson's heart.""
At the time, U.S. Marshals said police found Wilson bleeding and unconscious from multiple gunshot wounds. They performed CPR on her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.
In a short opening statement, defense attorney Geoffrey Puryear said Armstrong was caught in a ""web of circumstantial evidence.""
No video evidence or witnesses can put Armstrong at the scene of the shooting, Puryear said.
Police have said Wilson, a 25-year-old Vermont native, had previously dated Armstrong's boyfriend, Colin Strickland, who also was a competitive gravel racer, and had gone swimming with him earlier in the day. The trial began three weeks after authorities said Armstrong tried to escape from custody.
Prosecutors said they will show that Armstrong tracked Strickland's communications with Wilson — as well as Wilson's whereabouts — in the weeks and days before the shooting. Armstrong was allegedly able to track Wilson's location because Wilson had not turned on a safety feature on a fitness app. Jones said the evidence will show Armstrong looked Wilson up multiple times on the popular cycling app Strava, CBS affiliate KEYE-TV reported.
Armstrong's SUV was seen at the apartment where Wilson was staying the night she was killed. Police also said shell casings found at the scene matched a gun found at Armstrong's home.
Investigators quickly cleared Strickland. Prosecutors said Wednesday that video and cellphone calls, texting and location data will confirm that he was nowhere near the shooting.
Jones said that Armstrong and Strickland were romantic partners beginning in 2019 and became business partners in 2021, KEYE-TV reported.
""You'll hear from Colin that the relationship was on again, off again, and you will hear that when the relationship was off, they both dated other people,"" Jones said.
Strickland did not testify Wednesday, but he is named on the witness list for the trial, KEYE-TV reported.
Among the first witnesses were Caitlin Cash, the friend who found Wilson covered in blood and not breathing when she returned home from dinner and several police officers who arrived on the scene. The jury heard a recording of Cash's emergency call and the sound of her counting through chest compressions on Wilson. They later watched body camera footage from the first police officer who arrived and took over resuscitation efforts.
Wilson's family left the courtroom for the 911 call, and her parents kept their heads down to avoid watching the body camera footage. Cash was next to them during the footage that showed her pressing Wilson's chest when police arrived.
The case drew international headlines when Armstrong fled the country after her initial meeting with police, leading to a 43-day search. Investigators said she sold her vehicle for $12,000 and fled the country using her sister's name, email, credit card and passport.
Federal authorities tracked Armstrong to Costa Rica, where prosecutors said she spent $6,425 for surgery to change her appearance and used several aliases while attempting to establish herself as a yoga instructor. She also had cut and darkened her hair, and had a bandage on her nose and discoloration under her eyes when arrested at a beachside hostel.
Armstrong told police when she was arrested that she was injured in a surfing accident.
""[She had] a bandage on her nose and she had blood in her nostrils,"" witness Zachary Paulsen told Inside Edition.
Armstrong's attorney suggested the sudden flight out of the country was not an attempt to escape justice.
""She would have no reason to know about any (arrest) warrant, You will hear Kaitlin is passionate about traveling and passionate about yoga,"" Puryear said.
The case took another turn when authorities said Armstrong tried to escape from two officers who escorted her to a medical appointment outside of the jail on Oct. 11.
Cellphone video recorded in the parking lot showed Armstrong, handcuffed and in striped jail clothes, running from an officer and trying to climb a fence. Authorities have said Armstrong appeared to plan her escape by complaining of an injury to get the outside medical appointment and have her leg restraints removed.
She faces an additional felony escape charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

First responders dug through rubble to help survivors as flames were still shooting from the collapsed building and surrounding area, authorities said, according to reports.
Eight adults, two kids and five first responders were injured in the powerful explosion that happened around 12:15 p.m. in the Dutchess County community.
The cause appears to be from a gas leak, police reportedly said.
At least two adults and one child were airlifted to Westchester Medical Center, the Poughkeepsie Journal reported.
One of the ten victims was trapped from the waist down in the debris and another from the chest down, the newspaper reported.
The two-story structure destroyed is a multifamily building. Other nearby homes were charred by the raging fire.
Multiple fire and police departments rushed to the location.
ÔÇťAll of a sudden the house shook,ÔÇŁ neighbor Marcie Ward told ABC 7. ÔÇťI thought maybe something hit the house … I didnÔÇÖt know what it was.ÔÇŁ
Central Hudson said preliminarily a contractor for the power company struck a three-fourths gas line that sparked the blast, the Poughkeepsie Journal reported.
The exact cause of the explosion is still being investigated.
A woman who lives across the street told CBS 2 her mother was home at the time and said the windows were blown out and the front door flew open.

Sewell, 51, will join the organization on Nov. 27 as its first senior vice president of security and guest experience.Â
The new gig comes after she suddenly resigned as the Big Appleâs top cop in June after a year-and-a-half at the helm of the largest police force in the nation.
âThe NYPDâs loss is certainly Citi Fieldâs gain,â a retired NYPD detective told The Post.
âKeechant Sewell is a smart, no-nonsense leader who will undoubtedly surpass the expectations of those who hired her.â
Sewell, working under Metsâ Executive Vice President of Ballpark Operations and Experience Katie Haas, will oversee the safety and fan experience for the organization, the Mets said.
âKeechant will help us to modernize our approach to safety and the guest experience at Citi Field, while also strengthening our relationships with the community and all agencies of law enforcement and emergency services,â Haas said in a press release.
Sewell said she is excited to join the Mets in her first role in the private sector after a lifelong career in law enforcement.
âThe opportunity to bring my passions of community building and public safety to the Mets is truly a dream job,â she said in a statement. âAs someone who grew up in Queens, this legendary organization is vital to local communities and so many across the world. I canât wait to help be a part of building this world-class fan experience.â
A source close to Sewell told The Post that the hire âmakes senseâ for Sewell.
âThe Mets are very involved in the Widows and Childrenâs Foundation,â they said, referring to the Police Benevolent Association fund that assists widows and children of fallen NYPD officers.Â âItâs a dream job.”
A 22-year veteran of the Nassau County Police Department, Sewell spent most of her career policing on Long Island before Mayor Eric Adams hired her as the 45th NYPD commissioner â the first woman to hold the powerful position.
During Sewellâs tenure, the Big Apple saw a drop in shootings despite an overall uptick in crime in the five boroughs, according to department data.
Her resignation, which blindsided the mayor, came after Sewell felt she had her hands tied making promotional decisions within her department, which, unlike previous commissioners, she had to run past City Hall, law enforcement sources told The Post.
Edward Caban, who had previously served as the first deputy police commissioner under Sewell, was named new head of the department in July.",N

US companies push guns as blithely and murderously as they once did tobacco,2023-11-02,2023-11-03T02:33:33Z,en,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/02/us-gun-companies-suicide-homicide-laws-tobacco,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103023333id_/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/02/us-gun-companies-suicide-homicide-laws-tobacco,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103023333/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/02/us-gun-companies-suicide-homicide-laws-tobacco,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHRoZWd1YXJkaWFuKS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvbm92LzAyL3VzLWd1bi1jb21wYW5pZXMtc3VpY2lkZS1ob21pY2lkZS1sYXdzLXRvYmFjY28~,"The gunman who a week ago killed 18 people in Lewiston, Maine, finished his bloodbath by shooting himself. Like many mass shootings, his rampage appears to have been a suicide that took others with him. Mass shootings draw deserved media attention, but they are a small percentage of all gun deaths in the US; suicide is the most common way people die by gun. That is, if you own or have access to a gun, the person youâre most likely to kill is yourself. Fifty-four per cent of US gun deaths are suicides, which means access to a gun is a major risk factor for dying this way.
This fact, often cited but rarely examined, means the gun industry is pushing guns the same way the tobacco industry pushed cigarettes: their intentions toward their customers are blithely murderous. It also undermines the advertisements and arguments claiming that guns provide safety and protection. Of the 48,117 reported gun deaths in the US in 2022, 26,993 were suicides â a stunning number, a gun death every 11 minutes, the equivalent to a mid-sized town being wiped out annually.
Gun sales went up in Maine after the mass shooting and the two days the public feared a killer on the loose. The desire for protection is understandable but guns rarely provide it. Cases in which guns really are used to protect against harm are far, far, far rarer than the gun lobby and the macho fantasies of skillful gun use fed by films and video games suggest. Guns are rarely actually used in such situations, and when used, are seldom as effective as the fantasies suggest (and sometimes kill bystanders or are used against the gun owner). Even police, who are trained in marksmanship, mostly miss their intended targets in conflicts. The publication the Trace, noting that 16 million Americans who own AR-15 assault rifles say they are for self-defense, was able to find only 51 verified cases of owners using them in self-defense over an almost 10-year period.
Eighty-one per cent of AR-15 owners are male; 74% are white. Thereâs a kind of nightmarish illogic to the fact that people buy guns for protection when the people they are most likely to turn the guns on are themselves. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, âthe evidence indicates that the risk of suicide is three times as high when there is firearm access as when there is notâ. White men, who make up less than a third of the US population, make up more than two-thirds of suicides by guns, and run higher risks of suicide overall. As the Washington Post recently put it, âWhite men are six times as likely to die by suicide as other Americans.â
This is in part because white men own guns at higher rates than any other demographic. (Other factors, including social isolation and the masculine ideal of self-reliance, also matter.) An attempt to take your own life is usually born of desperation, by those who feel they have no other exit from an unbearable situation or state of mind. If these attempts are last, desperate pleas for help or change, death is not necessarily the real or only goal, and not dying is not failure. But with a gun, survival is much less likely. Addressing the underlying crises of despair and isolation matters for both suicide and homicides, including mass shootings; so does making guns far less available to those likely to use them to take lives.
If the left were pushing guns, you could imagine the right arguing that itâs a conspiracy against white men. But of course itâs the right that has built a cult around guns, the right that has pushed for lax gun laws, the right that has sought to make guns available to domestic abuse perpetrators, mentally ill people and people under 21 â such as the mass shooter who last year murdered 18 children and teachers in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, with an AR-15-style rifle purchased the day after his 18th birthday.
While the frontier rhetoric of protecting women is often invoked, male gun owners can and do turn these weapons on female partners and former partners at horrific rates. Half of all female murder victims are killed by intimate partners or family members, and most of these are gun deaths.
There are, of course, a lot of other people who die of gun violence and accidents. The gun industryâs monumental success in peddling their lethal products has well-known consequences: a Johns Hopkins School of Public Health study notes: âGuns remained the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2022. The rate of gun deaths among this group climbed 87% in the last decade (2013-2022).â The same Johns Hopkins study notes: âFrom 2019 to 2021, the gun suicide rate increased 10% while the non-gun suicide rate decreased by 8%,â meaning guns themselves were a major factor in who died by their own hand.
These deaths should be included in the national conversation about what kinds of threats guns pose and to whom. To do so would be to recognize that guns make us less, not more, safe â including from ourselves.

How a Campaign of Extremist Violence Is Pushing the West Bank to the Brink
Israeli settlers and Palestinians have been locked in a cycle of bloodshed for decades. But extremist settler attacks could send the conflict out of control.
This past Saturday morning, Bilal Mohammad Saleh, a Palestinian sidewalk vendor of sage and thyme, went out with his family to pick olives.
It’s olive harvesting season in the West Bank and Mr. Saleh was helping pluck the fruit from the gnarled trees that his family has owned for generations.
Then, four armed Jewish settlers showed up, witnesses said. They started yelling, and the olive pickers stopped what they were doing and began to run.
But Mr. Saleh forgot his phone.
“I’ll be right back,” he told his wife.
Two gunshots rang out, and in an instant, Mr. Saleh, who was known for his love of fresh leaves and being a fun dad, was face down in the olive grove, dead.
While the world’s attention has fallen on Gaza, violence in the West Bank, a much bigger and more complex Palestinian-majority area, is hitting its highest levels in years.
Some of the specific incidents, like the killing in the olive grove, reflect a longstanding problem in the West Bank that has gotten much worse since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks: Heavily armed settler extremists have operated with impunity for years, many Palestinians say, and now their assaults are becoming bolder, deadlier and nonstop.
Experienced observers believe the spike in violence is part of a broader campaign to scare Palestinians off their land that has been allowed to accelerate amid Israel’s enraged and wounded mood. Since Oct. 7, settler violence has displaced more than 800 Palestinians, including entire herding communities.
“The strategy is: We are here, this land belongs to us and we will kick you off it, with all the means we have,” said Dov Sedaka, a reserve Israeli general who works for a foundation that supports Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
“It’s awful,” he added.
He said because of the intense battle inside Gaza and the anguish all Israelis felt about the atrocities committed by Hamas, Israeli soldiers were now, more than ever, failing to live up to their duty to protect Palestinian civilians in occupied areas.
“They’re not stopping the extremist settlers,” he said. “They’re closing their eyes.”
According to witness statements, video footage and analysts who have examined larger patterns of the violence, settler extremists in the West Bank have been attacking Palestinian homes and businesses, blowing up their generators and solar panels, burning down the tents of seminomadic Bedouin herders — and even shooting people.
United Nations officials say that since Oct. 7, the Israel Defense Forces and armed settlers have killed more than 120 Palestinians in the West Bank. (Most of those deaths occurred in clashes with Israeli soldiers.)
Even before the Hamas attacks, settler violence was hitting its highest levels since the United Nations began tracking it in the mid 2000s. According to U.N. figures, there used to be one incident of settler violence a day. Now it’s seven.
On top of that, the number of protests by Palestinian youth, furious about the relentless bombardment of Gaza, is also rising. These protests frequently lead to deadly confrontations with Israeli troops. Soldiers are also staging nightly counterterrorism raids, which the Israelis say are necessary to crack down on armed groups. But the raids, often conducted in tight alleyways and densely inhabited neighborhoods, can set off more bloodshed as well.
The West Bank, which has been rocked by major uprisings before, feels primed to explode. And the worry, among Palestinians and the Israeli security establishment, is what happens if it does. Should the violence spin from the West Bank, it could risk opening another front in the war, further raising the chances of a larger, even more catastrophic regional conflict.
Palestinians and rights activists blame the increasingly combustible atmosphere on Israel’s right-wing government, whose ministers have vowed to expand the settlements and hand out more weapons to settlers. Deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank are also at their highest point since the 2000s, adding to the tensions and the sense that this whole territory is on edge. On Thursday, Israeli officials said that Palestinians opened fire on a car and killed the driver, a Jewish settler.
Gaza and the West Bank are two separate areas that Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, effectively sealing it off and leaving its residents subject to a tight blockade that throttled its economy.
But Israel still occupies the West Bank under a highly contentious system that leaves Palestinians stateless, limits their movements, and tries them in Israeli military courts — restrictions that do not apply to settlers. The Israeli military routinely blocks roads, orders Palestinians off streets and strictly controls access from one area to another.
Complicating the West Bank further is the growing number of Israeli settlements — more than 130 — that most of the world considers illegal because they were placed on occupied land.
These communities, often built on strategic hilltops and encircled by walls and razor wire, are interspersed among a patchwork of Palestinian cities and towns administered by the Palestinian Authority, a semiautonomous Palestinian body. Roughly half a million Jewish settlers live in the West Bank, alongside an estimated 2.7 million Palestinians.
Many settlers reject Palestinians’ claim to the land, arguing that Jews have been living in this territory since biblical times and that Israel justly won the territory decades ago in war.
According to Naomi Kahn, a settler who works for a nonprofit organization that supports the settlements, Palestinians say “Everything in the Middle East is their land.”
“Try again,” she said. “I’m not buying it.”
In recent days, threatening leaflets, widely presumed to have come from settler extremists, have been slipped under the windshield wipers of Palestinian cars.
“A great catastrophe will descend upon your heads soon,” read one flier. “We will destroy every enemy and expel you forcefully from our Holy Land that God has written for us. Wherever you are, carry your loads immediately and leave to where you came from. We are coming for you.”
Sam Stein is a Jewish peace activist from Long Island who has spent years working in the West Bank and has physically inserted himself between settler extremists and Palestinians. He said that all the recent violence was “not random acts of hatred.”
Instead, he said, it is a “guided approach” to create “Jewish continuity” in the West Bank.
Jewish settlers are aided in this project by the fact that they are allowed to carry weapons and Palestinian civilians are not. Another recent incident, one of many, shows how Palestinians often pay the price.
On Oct. 13, Zakariya al-Arda, a Palestinian construction worker living in a small West Bank town called At-Tuwani, was walking up a hill after Friday prayers with about eight friends. A video from that day shows that none of Mr. al-Arda’s group are carrying firearms though one is holding a rock.
A settler from Havat Ma’on, an outpost bordering At-Tuwani that is considered illegal even under Israeli law, comes down the hill brandishing a rifle. He clubs Mr. al-Arda with the butt. When Mr. al-Arda tries to defend himself, the settler shoots him.
The bullet pierces his stomach, a few inches below his lungs. He survives. But that single bullet has sown fear through the entire community.
“We did nothing to the settlers,” said Mr. al-Arda’s brother, Khaled. “They’re constantly harassing us, vandalizing our property and threatening our safety. What do they want from us?”
Boaz Natan, a settler and former soldier who oversees security in Havat Ma’on and the neighboring settlement Ma’on, knew about the shooting but said he didn’t want “to get into whether this was OK or not.” Still, he said, the settlement’s security committee immediately took away the man’s gun because they didn’t want “lone actors to do whatever they think needs to be done.”
The Israeli police are investigating the incident, according to the I.D.F.
Palestinian leaders say their people are more frightened — by what is happening in Gaza and now across the West Bank — than they have been in a long time.
“Israel says they have the right to respond. They responded,” said Mustafa Bargouthi, a senior Palestinian lawmaker. “How many more thousand Palestinians should still die before they stop?”
In the case of Mr. Saleh, the man killed while picking olives, his family remains in shock.
He lived in a village called Al Sawiya, north of Jerusalem. Forty years old, he struggled to support his four children with his small business selling fresh herbs in Ramallah, one of the West Bank’s bigger cities.
According to an I.D.F. spokesman, an off-duty soldier “allegedly” fired his military-issued weapon during the incident and has been taken into custody for questioning. The spokesman said that Israeli soldiers are required to intervene if they are present when violence erupts.
But in this case, Mohammad Yasser Saleh, one of Bilal’s cousins, said that Israeli soldiers sat in a jeep parked at the top of the hill during the shooting incident and watched the whole thing. The I.D.F. declined to comment on why the soldiers did not intervene.
The killing has left Mr. Saleh’s children in a daze.
Musa, 8, remembers what his father was doing right before the gunshots rang out.
“He was carrying me while dancing and making me laugh,” he said. “He then lifted me up to an olive tree and said, ‘Let’s see how many olives you can pick.’”

Our Coverage of the Israel-Hamas War
Ground Incursion: The Israeli military appears to have begun an invasion of the Gaza Strip. The operation, which is proceeding more slowly than expected, remains shrouded in secrecy.
Departures From Gaza: After three weeks of intensive diplomatic negotiations, the first of thousands of foreigners, aid workers and critically wounded patients in Gaza were allowed to begin evacuating to Egypt.
Jabaliya Airstrike: An airstrike that Israel said was targeting Hamas militants caused widespread damage in the densely populated neighborhood of Gaza, which is home to a large refugee camp. Hamas and hospital officials said numerous people were killed and wounded.
Hostages: Israel has said there are two main goals in the war: Destroy Hamas and free the hostages held in Gaza. But are those goals compatible?
In the West Bank: As the conflict continues, attacks by Israeli forces and settlers on Palestinians in the territory are surging, with at least 115 killed, more than 2,000 injured and nearly 1,000 others forcibly displaced from their homes, according to the U.N.
The Conflict’s Global Reach
Biden Administration: Even as President Biden presses Israel to define clearly the goals of its war against Hamas, he is turning his eyes to a much larger endgame: a lasting peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. The question is how hard he intends to work for it.
Two-State Solution: The idea of Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in their own sovereign countries is getting a new hearing in foreign-policy circles, with diplomats and analysts saying that the war may breathe new life into it.
Iran: For more than four decades, Iran’s rulers have pledged to destroy Israel. Now Tehran faces a dilemma, weighing how it and its proxy militias should respond to the invasion of Gaza at the risk of igniting a broader regional war.
An Expanding War?: Fears that Israel’s military operations could escalate into a regional conflict are clouding the global economy’s outlook, threatening to dampen growth and reignite a rise in energy and food prices.
A World of Terror: The Oct. 7 assault on Israel has awakened a repressed horror in Jewish populations in Europe, now compounded by dismay at the way the world’s sympathy has rapidly shifted to the Palestinians in Gaza.
Poster Activism: In the weeks since the start of the conflict, fliers depicting the hostages have become ubiquitous. But in cities and on college campuses across the globe, anti-Israel protesters have been caught tearing them down.",N

Duane Keith ""Keffe D"" Davis, a former Southern California street gang leader, pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder in the 1996 killing of rap music icon Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas — a charge prompted by his own descriptions in recent years about orchestrating the deadly drive-by shooting.
Davis is the only person still alive who was in the vehicle from which shots were fired and the only person ever charged with a crime in the case.
When did Tupac Shakur die?
Prosecutors allege that Shakur's killing in Las Vegas came out of competition between East Coast members of a Bloods gang sect and West Coast groups of a Crips sect, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre dubbed ""gangsta rap.""
A grand jury was told the Sept. 7, 1996, shooting in Las Vegas was retaliation for a brawl hours earlier at a Las Vegas Strip casino involving Shakur and Davis' nephew, Orlando ""Baby Lane"" Anderson.
Who was Tupac Shakur?
Shakur is largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time. He had five No. 1 albums, was nominated for six Grammy Awards, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, and received a posthumous star this year on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
What happened in court?
In court on Thursday, Davis stood in shackles as he awaited proceedings and waved to his wife, son and daughter in the packed spectator gallery.
""Not guilty,"" Davis said when Clark County District Court Judge Tierra Jones asked for his plea.
The judge told Davis that prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty in the case, which could put Davis in prison for the rest of his life if he is convicted. Jones also named county special public defenders Robert Arroyo and Charles Cano to represent Davis at taxpayer expense, after Davis lost his bid to hire private defense attorney Ross Goodman.
Goodman two weeks ago said prosecutors lack witnesses and key evidence, including a gun or vehicle, for the killing committed 27 years ago. Outside the courtroom on Thursday, Goodman said Davis was still trying to hire him. Davis' family members declined to comment.
Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told reporters that he and a panel of prosecutors decided the case against Davis was ""not the kind of case that should proceed with the asking of the death penalty."" He didn't specify reasons for that decision.
Wolfson also declined to respond to Goodman's criticism of the evidence, saying that a jury will weigh the results of the police investigation.
In court, Davis wore dark-blue jail garb and answered several questions, telling the judge that he attended ""a year in college,"" wasn't under the influence of drugs, medication or alcohol, and he understood he is charged with murder. The judge set his next court date for Tuesday to schedule the trial.
Davis, 60, is originally from Compton, California. He was arrested Sept. 29 outside a home in suburban Henderson where Las Vegas police served a search warrant July 17, drawing renewed attention to one of hip-hop music's most enduring mysteries. Davis remains jailed without bail, did not testify before the grand jury that indicted him, and declined from jail to speak with The Associated Press.
The indictment alleges Davis obtained and provided a gun to someone in the back seat of a Cadillac before the car-to-car gunfire that mortally wounded Shakur and wounded rap music mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight at an intersection just off the Las Vegas Strip. Shakur died a week later. He was 25.
Knight, now 58, is in prison in California, serving a 28-year sentence for the death of a Compton businessman in 2015. He has not responded to messages through his attorneys seeking comment about Davis' arrest.
Prosecutors told a grand jury that Davis implicated himself in the killing in multiple interviews and a 2019 tell-all memoir that described his life leading a Crips sect in Compton. Davis has said he obtained a .40-caliber handgun and handed it to Anderson, a member of Davis' gang, in the back seat of a Cadillac, though he didn't identify Anderson as the shooter.
Anderson, then 22, denied involvement in Shakur's killing and died two years later in a shooting in his hometown of Compton. The other back seat passenger and the driver of the Cadillac are also dead.
In his book, Davis wrote that he told authorities in 2010 what he knew of the killings of Shakur and gang rival Notorious B.I.G, whose legal name is Christopher Wallace, to protect himself and 48 of his Southside Compton Crips gang associates from prosecution and the possibility of life sentences in prison.
Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls, was shot and killed in Los Angeles in March 1997, six months after Shakur's death.

DRIVING THE DAY
HEEL TURN â NIKKI HALEY went there. In a âDaily Showâ appearance late last night, guest host CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD asked the surging South Carolinian about Florida Gov. RON DeSANTISâ rumored use of height-boosting lifts in his omnipresent cowboy boots.
Charlamagne: âAre you wearing higher heels than Ron DeSantis next week at the debate so that you can look taller than him on the stage?â
Haley: âI donât know. Weâll have to figure that out. I can tell you: Iâve always talked about my high heels. Iâve never hid that from anybody. Iâve always said, âDonât wear âem if you canât run in âem,â so weâll see if he can run in âem.â Video
SENATE REPUBLICANS TURN ON TUBERVILLE â For weeks now, Senate Democrats and the White House have lambasted Sen. TOMMY TUBERVILLE for holding up military promotions in protest of a controversial military policy on abortion care for service members. Now, the Alabama Republicanâs blockade is running headfirst into a new wave of resistance from his own party.
A group of Senate Republicans took to the chamber floor last night to ask for unanimous consent to confirm dozens of the more than 350 nominations languishing in the backlog. One by one, they read service membersâ bios and praised their acumen. And one by one, Tuberville objected.
The intraparty conflict got ugly. Sen. DAN SULLIVAN (R-Alaska) â who had been trying to work with Tuberville to assuage his concerns, but ultimately led the GOP confrontation of him last night â accused his colleague of conducting a ânational security suicide mission.â
âIâm as pro-life as they come!â Sullivan insisted, a reference to Tubervilleâs indignation over the Pentagon paying for abortion-related travel for troops stationed in states where the procedure is banned. âAmerica needs to have â¦ our most combat-capable leaders on the fieldâ ASAP, he said, going on to accuse Tuberville of endangering the nation.
At one point, Sen. LINDSEY GRAHAM held up a photo of LAURA LENDERMAN, who is supposed to be promoted to lieutenant general and deputy commander of Pacific Air Forces. While the South Carolina Republican noted that sheâs flown âthousandsâ of hours and has âzeroâ to do with the Pentagonâs abortion policy, Tuberville still objected.
âYou just denied this lady a promotion â you did that,â Graham snarled, launching into a tirade about how Tuberville is setting a new precedent of holding service member advancements hostage over policy disagreements â one that Democrats could adopt someday when Republicans control the White House. âWho the hell wants to serve in the military when your promotion can be canned over something you have nothing to do with? â¦ If you think itâs illegal, go to court!â
Democrats have pulled such stunts before on the floor to showcase Tubervilleâs blockade, which military leaders have argued undermines U.S. military readiness and operations as well as long-term retention efforts. But yesterday was the first time we saw such a public split within the Senate GOP.
So whatâs different this time? Frustration with Tuberville in GOP circles has been simmering on the back burner for months. But with war in the Middle East, Russiaâs ongoing invasion of Ukraine, escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, and even FBI Director CHRISTOPHER WRAY warning lawmakers this week of new threats to the U.S. following Hamasâ attack, it finally boiled over.
And thereâs new pressure inside the Senate, too. Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER backed a proposal to temporarily change chamber rules to allow most military promotions to be confirmed en bloc; that is, with a single vote. The idea â proposed by Sens. JACK REED (D-R.I.) and KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-Ariz.) â would need 60 votes on the floor, meaning nine Republicans.
So will irritated GOP senators join with Democrats to circumvent Tubervilleâs holds? Itâs suddenly not inconceivable. Keep watching this space.

GOP INFIGHTING, PART II â Even beyond the Tuberville confrontation, Republican infighting continues to be the theme of Capitol Hill this week â never mind GOP lawmakersâ claims to be unified behind their new speaker.
Last night in the lower chamber, Republicans teamed with Democrats to sink their own colleaguesâ efforts to (1) expel indicted Rep. GEORGE SANTOS (R-N.Y.) and (2) censure Rep. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-Mich.) over her criticisms of Israel.
The latter result has Rep. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-Ga.), the author of the Tlaib censure, in a bit of a tizzy. CNNâs Mel Zanona and Annie Grayer had a juicy little nugget about Greene going after swing-district Rep. YOUNG KIM (R-Calif.) for speaking out against her resolution on a private call. After the effort went down, the Georgia Republican tweeted out the list of names of her colleagues who opposed her resolution.
âThis is why Republicans NEVER do anything to stop the communists Democrats or ever hold anyone accountable!!â she wrote on X. âPATHETIC.â
All of this is in addition to the bicameral fight happening between Republicans about whether Ukraine aid should be tied to funding for Israel. Speaker MIKE JOHNSON made a bit of an about-face on the Ukraine matter yesterday, telling Senate Republicans in a private lunch that he now supports such funding. But he doesnât want to move it right now, and has not committed to advancing it by a certain time in the future â putting him at odds with Senate Minority Leader MITCH McCONNELL, whoâs a staunch Russia hawk and Ukraine defender.
Whatâs more, behind the scenes, the story in the House is turning to a GOP divide over the future of SNAP benefits, or food stamps, as our colleague Meredith Lee Hill writes in a story that just posted.
Johnson, a fiscal conservative, has long supported steep cuts to the program that feeds 41 million low-income Americans. Some Republicans in swing districts fear he could endorse a farm bill that rolls back the program to historic levels.
Meanwhile, Meredith reports that some Republicans are pushing for Johnson to attach a temporary extension of current farm policy to the next continuing resolution â a timeline that would kick the fight over food stamps to smack in the middle of the 2024 election cycle.

3 things to watch â¦
- The I-word is back. After a nearly monthlong hiatus for â well, you know â House Republicans have rekindled talk of impeaching President JOE BIDEN. House Oversight Chair JAMES COMER (R-Ky.) yesterday rolled out a new video accusing Biden of accepting $40,000 in âlaunderedâ Chinese money via his brother JAMES. White House spokesperson IAN SAMS quickly noted that (a) the check in question was a loan repayment, (b) Biden was not in office or running for office at the time, and (c) this is all quickly approaching PEPE SILVIA territory. But the story has legs in the House GOP: During last nightâs âHannityâ special with Republican members, the vast majority raised their hands when asked if the House was headed for impeachment.
- A new carbon tax proposal? From Republicans? Well, kinda: Sens. BILL CASSIDY (R-La.), ROGER WICKER (R-Miss.) and Graham are introducing legislation that would levy a new fee on imports from high greenhouse gas-emitting countries, our Josh Siegel scoops this morning. The bill is squarely aimed at China and ârepresents the first GOP-led proposal to inject climate change policy into U.S. trade rules through so-called carbon adjustment fees,â he writes. The proposal is winning praise from climate hawk Sen. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-R.I.), even though it stops well short of imposing domestic carbon pricing.
- Johnsonâs big promotion means an opening in the lower rungs of the House Republican leadership, and seven members are looking for a foothold. Reps. MARK ALFORD (Mo.), MIKE COLLINS (Ga.), MICHELLE FISCHBACH (Minn.), NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (N.Y.), BRIAN MAST (Fla.), BLAKE MOORE (Utah) and BETH VAN DUYNE (Texas) made yesterdayâs 5 p.m. deadline to file for GOP conference vice chair; the election will be settled next week.

AMERICA AND THE WORLD
MIDDLE EAST LATEST â Some American citizens finally made it out of Gaza yesterday, Oriana Pawlyk reports, though the U.S. said others are still waiting on guidance for how to get to Egypt. The crossings followed âweeks of intensive, multi-party diplomatic efforts,â led by Qatar, CNNâs Priscilla Alvarez, Jennifer Hansler and MJ Lee report. Biden said the U.S. had worked hard to secure the diplomatic breakthrough, per Bloomberg.
Those who got out are escaping utter devastation. Israel has decided that it will hammer Hamas âat all costs,â WSJâs Dov Lieber, David Cloud, Chao Deng and David Luhnow report â and the cost seems to be thousands of Palestinian lives, plus a growing international backlash. Another Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp, which Israel said killed key Hamas targets, killed more than 80 people, most of them civilians, a hospital director told CNN. U.S. officials warned Israel against blocking the internet in Gaza again. But analysts tell the AP that Israel, the U.S. and other allies have acted with âquestionable assumptions and short-term thinkingâ â because they have no clear plan for what will happen in the region after the war.
Biden is now talking about a long-term peace deal, NYTâs Michael Crowley reports â a shift for a president who had de-prioritized the Middle East until a few weeks ago. The White House is also discussing the possibility that Israeli PM BENJAMIN NETANYAHU wonât be able to hold onto power, Jonathan Lemire, Nahal Toosi and Alex Ward report.
The intense U.S. political fallout continues to be supercharged on all sides. A rabbi confronted Biden at an event yesterday to demand that he call for a cease-fire. â¦ Mast and Fox Newsâ JESSE WATTERS both ventured into outright Islamophobia, respectively questioning the concept of innocent Palestinian civilians and saying âweâve had itâ with Arab Americans and Muslims. â¦ AIPAC and progressive House members feuded on X, calling each other bigoted, anti-democratic and/or anti-Israel. â¦
â¦ Muslim leaders in Minnesota are vowing that Biden will suffer the wrath of voters: âThere is literally a c(4) being created every day to run the âAbandoned Bidenâ campaign across the country,â one tells NBCâs Alex Seitz-Wald, Julia Jester and Gabe Gutierrez. â¦ Deep anger and a âstorm of dissentâ at the State Department have created âone of the largest challenges to [Secretary ANTONY] BLINKENâs tenure at the State Department so far,â Foreign Policyâs Robbie Gramer reports. âIn 25 years working at the Department of State â¦ Iâve never seen anything like this,â one expert says.

THE WHITE HOUSE
THE EDUCATION OF BRUCE REED â The White House deputy chief of staff is steering the administrationâs artificial intelligence policy, which takes a tough approach to guard against potentially catastrophic ramifications for the nature of truth, Nancy Scola reports in a major POLITICO Magazine profile this morning. Reed, a longtime Democratic policy leader who granted rare interviews for the story, has transformed into a tough antitrust advocate aligned with progressives. In part, thatâs born out of Reedâs sense that Washington failed to regulate sufficiently on the last major tech issue â the rise of social media â and the public square has suffered the consequences.
âThe White Houseâs AI strategy also reflects a big mindset shift in the Democratic Party,â Nancy writes. âUnderlying it is Bidenâs and Reedâs belief that Big Tech has become arrogant about its alleged positive impact on the world and insulated by a compliant Washington from the consequences of the resulting damage.â
MEANWHILE IN BLETCHLEY PARK â âKamala Harris seizes agenda as Rishi Sunakâs AI summit kicks off,â by Eugene and Vincent Manancourt: â[F]or all the brouhaha around Sunakâs summit â and notable diplomatic breakthroughs with the Bletchley Declaration signed by Beijing, Washington and others â Britain is falling behind the likes of the EU, Canada and now the U.S. in bringing through concrete rules around AI.â
âHarris also urged the international community to focus on the âfull spectrumâ of artificial intelligence risks, including existing threats like bias and discrimination. It was a gentle rebuke to Sunakâs summit, which has courted controversy due to its laser focus on the unrealized existential risks of the tech.â

BATTLE FOR THE HOUSE â The House GOP will see another big departure next term as Rep. KEN BUCK (R-Colo.) announced he wonât run for reelection, The Denver Postâs Nick Coltrain reports. The Freedom Caucus member has lately broken repeatedly with his party over widespread Republican falsehoods about the 2020 election, and his announcement video didnât hold back: âToo many Republican leaders are lying to America,â Buck warned. âThese insidious narratives breed widespread cynicism and erode Americansâ confidence in the rule of law.â Buck has reportedly been circling a commentator gig at CNN. Ironically, his departure could pave the way for a crowded primary in his conservative district of Republicans who propagate the lie.
Meanwhile, there were a lot of familiar names launching or considering bids for the House yesterday:
Former Rep. TRENT FRANKS (R-Ariz.) is seeking a comeback five years after his ignominious departure, which followed the news that heâd asked two female staffers to carry his baby, the Arizona Republicâs Ryan Randazzo reports.
Former Nashville Mayor MEGAN BARRY may be seeking a comeback five years after her ignominious departure, which followed the news that sheâd had an affair with her head of security, the Nashville Bannerâs Steve Cavendish and Connor Daryani scooped. Her potential House bid would be an uphill battle against GOP Rep. MARK GREEN, though.
DAN COX is seeking a comeback after losing badly in the Maryland gubernatorial election last year. This time, heâs jumping into the competitive 6th Congressional District race, per CBS Baltimoreâs Adam Thompson.
And SUSHEELA JAYAPAL, sister of Rep. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-Wash.), stepped down from the Multnomah County, Ore., Commission yesterday to run in a newly open seat, The Oregonianâs Jamie Goldberg reports.

"Video captures final screams of pro cyclist Mo Wilson after accused killer Kaitlin Armstrong tracked her on fitness app, prosecutor says",2023-11-02,2023-11-03T02:56:10Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/kaitlin-armstrong-trial-video-captures-final-screams-pro-cyclist-mo-wilson-prosecutor-says/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103025610id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/kaitlin-armstrong-trial-video-captures-final-screams-pro-cyclist-mo-wilson-prosecutor-says/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103025610/https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/kaitlin-armstrong-trial-video-captures-final-screams-pro-cyclist-mo-wilson-prosecutor-says/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL2thaXRsaW4tYXJtc3Ryb25nLXRyaWFsLXZpZGVvLWNhcHR1cmVzLWZpbmFsLXNjcmVhbXMtcHJvLWN5Y2xpc3QtbW8td2lsc29uLXByb3NlY3V0b3Itc2F5cw~~,"Video captures final screams of pro cyclist Mo Wilson after accused killer Kaitlin Armstrong tracked her on fitness app, prosecutor says
The murder trial of a woman accused of gunning down rising pro cyclist Anna Moriah Wilson and fleeing the country began Wednesday with Texas prosecutors telling jurors they would hear Wilson's final screams and the shots that killed her.
Kaitlin Armstrong, 35, has pleaded not guilty to murder and faces up to 99 years in prison in the May 2022 slaying of Wilson, a competitive gravel and mountain bike racer. Wilson had been shot in the head and chest when she was found at a friend's home before a race that she was among the favorites to win.
""The last thing Mo did on this earth was scream in terror,"" Travis County prosecutor Rickey Jones told jurors in opening statements.
He said nearby surveillance equipment captured the screams.
""Those screams are followed by 'Pop! Pop!'"" Jones said, smacking his hands together for emphasis. ""You won't hear any more screams after that.""
Seconds after those shots, Jones said, ""Kaitlin Armstrong stood over Mo Wilson and put a third shot right into Mo Wilson's heart.""
At the time, U.S. Marshals said police found Wilson bleeding and unconscious from multiple gunshot wounds. They performed CPR on her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.
In a short opening statement, defense attorney Geoffrey Puryear said Armstrong was caught in a ""web of circumstantial evidence.""
No video evidence or witnesses can put Armstrong at the scene of the shooting, Puryear said.
Police have said Wilson, a 25-year-old Vermont native, had previously dated Armstrong's boyfriend, Colin Strickland, who also was a competitive gravel racer, and had gone swimming with him earlier in the day. The trial began three weeks after authorities said Armstrong tried to escape from custody.
Prosecutors said they will show that Armstrong tracked Strickland's communications with Wilson — as well as Wilson's whereabouts — in the weeks and days before the shooting. Armstrong was allegedly able to track Wilson's location because Wilson had not turned on a safety feature on a fitness app. Jones said the evidence will show Armstrong looked Wilson up multiple times on the popular cycling app Strava, CBS affiliate KEYE-TV reported.
Armstrong's SUV was seen at the apartment where Wilson was staying the night she was killed. Police also said shell casings found at the scene matched a gun found at Armstrong's home.
Investigators quickly cleared Strickland. Prosecutors said Wednesday that video and cellphone calls, texting and location data will confirm that he was nowhere near the shooting.
Jones said that Armstrong and Strickland were romantic partners beginning in 2019 and became business partners in 2021, KEYE-TV reported.
""You'll hear from Colin that the relationship was on again, off again, and you will hear that when the relationship was off, they both dated other people,"" Jones said.
Strickland did not testify Wednesday, but he is named on the witness list for the trial, KEYE-TV reported.
Among the first witnesses were Caitlin Cash, the friend who found Wilson covered in blood and not breathing when she returned home from dinner and several police officers who arrived on the scene. The jury heard a recording of Cash's emergency call and the sound of her counting through chest compressions on Wilson. They later watched body camera footage from the first police officer who arrived and took over resuscitation efforts.
Wilson's family left the courtroom for the 911 call, and her parents kept their heads down to avoid watching the body camera footage. Cash was next to them during the footage that showed her pressing Wilson's chest when police arrived.
The case drew international headlines when Armstrong fled the country after her initial meeting with police, leading to a 43-day search. Investigators said she sold her vehicle for $12,000 and fled the country using her sister's name, email, credit card and passport.
Federal authorities tracked Armstrong to Costa Rica, where prosecutors said she spent $6,425 for surgery to change her appearance and used several aliases while attempting to establish herself as a yoga instructor. She also had cut and darkened her hair, and had a bandage on her nose and discoloration under her eyes when arrested at a beachside hostel.
Armstrong told police when she was arrested that she was injured in a surfing accident.
""[She had] a bandage on her nose and she had blood in her nostrils,"" witness Zachary Paulsen told Inside Edition.
Armstrong's attorney suggested the sudden flight out of the country was not an attempt to escape justice.
""She would have no reason to know about any (arrest) warrant, You will hear Kaitlin is passionate about traveling and passionate about yoga,"" Puryear said.
The case took another turn when authorities said Armstrong tried to escape from two officers who escorted her to a medical appointment outside of the jail on Oct. 11.
Cellphone video recorded in the parking lot showed Armstrong, handcuffed and in striped jail clothes, running from an officer and trying to climb a fence. Authorities have said Armstrong appeared to plan her escape by complaining of an injury to get the outside medical appointment and have her leg restraints removed.

San Francisco Wants to Eliminate Illegal License Plate Covers,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T07:18:57Z,en,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/san-francisco-license-plate-covers.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102071857id_/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/san-francisco-license-plate-covers.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102071857/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/san-francisco-license-plate-covers.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55dGltZXMpLzIwMjMvMTEvMDEvdXMvc2FuLWZyYW5jaXNjby1saWNlbnNlLXBsYXRlLWNvdmVycy5odG1s,"Supported by

San Francisco Wants to Eliminate Illegal License Plate Covers
The city attorney plans to order four websites to stop selling gadgets used to evade the police, tolls and tickets, calling them “like something out of Gotham City.”
A suspect speeds through city streets while trying to evade the police and, with the push of a button next to the driver’s seat, lowers an opaque screen over the car’s license plate.
It sounds like a cartoonish device that the Joker might use to thwart Batman, but it’s very real — and readily available online for about $50.
It’s illegal to use such a gadget in California and illegal to sell one, too. But that hasn’t stopped people from selling a variety of products intended to obscure license plate numbers to shoppers across the state on Amazon, Walmart, eBay and even Etsy.
The San Francisco city attorney, David Chiu, has a host of these devices in his wood-paneled office in City Hall. And on Wednesday, he plans to announce that he will demand that the four companies remove the products from their websites.
“It sounds like something out of Gotham City, and it shouldn’t be legal anywhere in America,” Chiu said. “The product descriptions themselves, as well as reviews by their customers, make it abundantly clear these are products used for illegal activity.”
The gadgets include remote-controlled devices that drivers can use to lower screens over their license plates; vinyl wraps with numbers that conceal the real ones; and cloudy screens that can be placed over plates to make their numbers impossible to read.
They can be used to skirt bridge tolls, red-light cameras and speed enforcement cameras, which will be allowed in San Francisco and a few other California cities starting next year. Chiu said his lawyers found comments in product reviews like “Works well for running from cops” and “These products are great to evade law enforcement!”
Many of the most rampant crimes in San Francisco involve automobiles. A person is severely injured in a car crash on city streets every 15 hours. Car break-ins, often perpetrated by thieves who are in idling cars themselves, have swelled since 2011; nearly 17,000 have been reported this year.
A newer crime that the police call “ram raiding” involves driving a car into a storefront window, filling the vehicle with stolen goods and speeding away. Car thefts and sideshows are also common.
Chiu said he had never heard of the license-plate-covering devices until San Francisco’s police chief, Bill Scott, mentioned his frustration with them at a public safety meeting in June.
“My first thought was, ‘Where are they selling these?’” Chiu recalled. “The chief mentioned, ‘Oh, you can just go on Amazon.’”
Some states allow the devices if the cars are parked, to protect plates from weathering, Chiu learned. But in most states, including California, they’re “flat-out illegal,” he said.
He added that he was surprised to see the products proliferate even on Etsy, a site better known for handmade goods.
“They’re artisanal license plate covers,” the deputy city attorney, David Louk, said.
Spokespeople for Etsy, eBay and Amazon said that sellers on their sites were required to comply with all laws and that the sites removed illegal items when they were made aware of them. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.
Chiu said he was hopeful that the four sites would proactively remove all the devices, but declined to say what action he would take if they didn’t.
“These are illegal to sell and use, and these online marketplaces ought to know that,” he said.

And before you go, some good news
When Pellier Park in downtown San Jose closed, just one year after its planned opening in 1977, the fate of the agricultural park appeared grim. But now after four decades and much delay, the park has reopened, securing its long-term home among the city’s growing network of community green spaces.
The brainchild of the San Jose historian Leonard McKay, the park was constructed in honor of Louis Pellier — a founder of California’s prune industry and widely known as the Prune King — on the site of his home and his plant nursery.
The park first opened in the 1970s, financed in part by McKay’s fund-raising, but it closed shortly after that because the city lacked the resources to maintain it. A plan in the early 2000s to restore and expand the park was delayed for years by financing issues and a long redesign process.
Those plans finally came to fruition last month with the official reopening of Pellier Park in a public ceremony in San Jose. The renovated park is shaped like a plum and includes historically relevant details like a French prune tree and a photo wall describing Pellier’s contributions to the region.
Pellier Park is the latest in a series of historically focused parks that have opened recently in San Jose, including Heinlenville Park. Read more about the history of Pellier Park.

Why was Maine shooter allowed to have guns? Questions swirl in wake of massacre.,2023-11-01,2023-11-03T01:49:24Z,en,politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/01/maine-shooter-gun-rights-legal-00124886,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103014924id_/https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/01/maine-shooter-gun-rights-legal-00124886,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103014924/https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/01/maine-shooter-gun-rights-legal-00124886,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHBvbGl0aWNvKS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMTEvMDEvbWFpbmUtc2hvb3Rlci1ndW4tcmlnaHRzLWxlZ2FsLTAwMTI0ODg2,"Why was Maine shooter allowed to have guns? Questions swirl in wake of massacre.
“This is the clearest-cut case I’ve seen where an extreme risk protection order could have saved all these lives,” one expert said.
LEWISTON, Maine — A history of mental illness. An array of weapons. Law enforcement knew about his potential for violence. But he was still able to own guns and commit the deadliest mass shooting in Maine’s history.
One week later, many in Lewiston and nationwide are asking: Why did he have guns at all?
Robert Card was identified by authorities as a person of interest four hours after he shot and killed 18 people and wounded 13 others at a bowling alley and a bar in Maine’s second-largest city. But Card, who was found dead two days after his rampage, had been well known to law enforcement for months.
“This is the clearest-cut case I’ve seen where an extreme risk protection order could have saved all these lives,” said Mark Collins, federal policy director at the gun-violence prevention group Brady, referring to measures often called “ red flag” laws, which Maine does not have.
“This guy did everything short of taking out a front-page ad in the newspaper saying he was going to commit an atrocity,” Collins said.
The intensifying scrutiny over Card’s access to firearms underscores the difficulty in seizing guns from potentially dangerous people with mental illness — especially when numerous states and jurisdictions are involved, as was the case with Card.
The U.S. Army reservist spent time in a psychiatric facility in New York this summer and he reportedly blamed fellow military officials for his hospitalization, according to a letter an unidentified member of the unit wrote to a Maine sheriff’s deputy.
It’s unclear when the letter was sent, but the writer describes getting a call from a friend of Card’s who was concerned Card was “going to snap and commit a mass shooting.” The letter was included in the deputy’s Sept. 15 report about efforts to contact Card.
Card threatened to shoot up the Army reserve drill center in Saco, Maine, and other places, and said that he was going to get “them.”
“Since the commander and I are the ones who had him committed we are the ‘them,’” wrote the unidentified letter writer. “He also said I was the reason he can’t buy guns anymore because of the commitment.”
Authorities at the state and federal level have not said that Card’s history of mental illness should have triggered laws that kept him from owning guns. There was nothing on Card’s record before the shooting that would have kept him from passing a federal background check to buy a gun, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a statement.
Involuntary commitments are reported to federal authorities differently from state to state, said Collins.
Generally, though, not everyone who gets mental health treatment at a facility is considered involuntarily committed. That’s a determination legally made by a court or a board, which then communicates it to another state body tasked with sending that information to the federal background-check system maintained by the FBI.
Each state has an agency that should report it, but it’s not legally required everywhere, he said. Maine does require the State Bureau of Identification to report commitments to the FBI database.
Facts about the shooting – and the police response – will be determined by an independent commission, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said Wednesday, adding she wants to know “what more could have been done to prevent this tragedy from occurring.”
Concern about Card’s behavior accelerated following an altercation he had with fellow Army Reserve members. Card and other members of the Army Reserve’s 3rd Battalion, 304th Infantry Unit were in New York for training on July 15 when he accused several of them of calling him a pedophile, shoved one of them and locked himself in his motel room. The next morning, he told another soldier that he wanted people to stop talking about him.
“I told him no one was talking about him and everyone here was his friend. Card told me to leave him alone and tried to slam the door in my face,” the soldier later told Maine authorities, according to documents released by the sheriff’s office.
New York State Police responded and helped bring Card to a hospital at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point for an evaluation. Card spent 14 days at the Four Winds Psychiatric Hospital in Katonah, New York, which is a few miles (kilometers) from West Point.
Jonathan Crisp, an army lawyer for two decades before starting a criminal defense practice, said when soldiers are committed involuntarily to mental health facilities by others in the chain of command, it is a “reportable” event under Army regulations that triggers a requirement to alert others, including the FBI.
“If they took him and he didn’t want to go and he refused to be admitted, it’s a slam dunk,” Crisp said. “This should have been reported.”
Questions over military protocols that should’ve been enacted with Card are similar to those raised after a 2017 mass shooting during Sunday services at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. More than two dozen people — including eight children — were shot and killed by a gunman who had served in the Air Force before the attack and had once escaped a mental health center.
After Card left the psychiatric facility in early August, the Army directed that while on duty, he shouldn’t be allowed to have a weapon, handle ammunition or participate in live-fire activity. It also declared him to be non-deployable.
Military experts say that even if Card’s commanders determined he shouldn’t be around weapons after being committed, they would have had only a handful of options to implement, such as prohibiting him from handling weapons while on duty or attempting to sever him from the Army Reserves. There’s little they can do when the citizen-soldiers are back in civilian life.
Several weeks after his release from the hospital, on Sept. 15, a deputy was sent to visit Card’s home in Bowdoin, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Lewiston, for a wellness check. A deputy went to Card’s trailer but couldn’t find him.
The sheriff’s office then sent out a statewide alert seeking help locating Card. It included a warning that he was known to be “armed and dangerous” and that officers should use extreme caution.
On Sept. 16, the same deputy and another one returned to Card’s trailer. Card’s car was there and the deputy said he could hear him moving around the trailer, but no one answered the door, according to the deputy’s report.
Deputies didn’t have legal authority to press the case if Card didn’t want to open the door, Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry said Wednesday .
On Oct. 18, the sheriff’s office canceled a statewide alert seeking help locating Card.
A week later, shortly before 7 p.m. on Oct. 25, authorities began receiving 911 calls about a gunman at the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley in Lewiston.",N

Amid uncertainty about whether more attacks were imminent, paramedics did not enter Masjid an-Nur, the first of two New Zealand mosques attacked by the Australian gunman, until 30 minutes after the attack ended.
A verified timeline of the emergency response to the 15 March 2019 massacre emerged publicly for the first time since the mass shooting when CCTV footage was played on Wednesday during the coronial inquest into the deaths of 51 Muslim worshipers. Dozens more were injured in the attack.
Brenton Tarrant, 28, an Australian man who was radicalised online and moved to New Zealand in 2017 where he bought guns and planned the hate-fuelled attack, was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2020 for murder, attempted murder, and terrorism. A commission of inquiry in 2020 concluded that New Zealand government agencies could not have stopped the massacre beforehand âexcept by chance.â
But no other inquiry before the coronial investigation had scrutinised how New Zealandâs authorities responded after the gunman opened fire. While the actions of police officers in catching him 19 minutes after the attack began have been widely praised, many of those responding have said the attack in a relatively peaceful country where serious gun crime is rare confronted them with scenes they had never expected.
A lingering question for some bereaved relatives in the years since the attack ârevolves around why our loved ones were left at the mosque without any immediate action for some time and the police did not allow us or anyone else to get them out,â Rashid Omar, a spokesperson for the 15 March WhÄnau Trust â representing many of the bereaved families â said in a written statement before the inquest began. His son, Tariq Omar, 24, was killed at Masjid an-Nur.
CCTV footage from the mosque, played in court on Wednesday, showed four police officers from the armed offenders squad â the first to enter the building after the attack â running for their vehicle and departing as they learned Tarrant had opened fire at a second mosque in the city, Linwood Islamic Centre.
Before they were ordered to leave Masjid an-Nur, where 43 people were killed, the officers had started to triage the wounded. But they swiftly ran out of bandages and called on their radios, with increasing urgency, for paramedics. Two told the inquest at the Christchurch high court this week that they did not understand why none arrived.
One was asked what he believed would happen to the surviving victims when he left the mosque.
âI wasnât sure,â he said. But as a tactical operator his job was to apprehend the gunman, he added.
After the first officersâ departure, almost ten minutes passed before anyone else entered the mosque. At 2:15pm â a quarter of an hour after Tarrant had been rammed in his car and arrested while trying to reach a third mosque â two paramedics were escorted inside by armed police.
By then, the terrorist had told the officers arresting him that he was one of 10 gunmen planning attacks that day. It wasnât true, but the claim had prompted more alarm at Masjid an-Nur. The officer guarding the mosqueâs gate â whose name and rank, like many of those giving evidence, are suppressed â told the court that with few other officers remaining at the scene, he did not want to leave the building defenceless by going inside to help people.
Another incorrect report on the police communications channel â about shots fired at Christchurch hospital â diverted other officers there. The arrival of medical help was further vexed when a senior officer at the district command centre gave a panicked warning on the police radio that Tarrant â who had already been arrested â was returning to the scene.
Det Supt Darryl Sweeney did not know that he was watching a delayed version of Tarrantâs video of the attack, which the gunman had broadcast live on the internet. He continued to narrate the terroristâs return to the mosque for three minutes as officers standing outside the building, who knew the report was untrue, listened in bewilderment. One told the court he was unable to break into the communication channel to quell the alarm.
Many officers, including Sweeney, said they would not have done anything differently with the information they had at the time.
Coroner Brigitte Windley will decide, after the seven week hearing at the high court in Christchurch, whether any of those killed could have been saved. She is expected to publish findings in 2024 about 10 of the 13 questions before her inquiry.
But the inquest, which began 24 October, has already answered some long-held questions. An evidential report published by the police in February 2021 said the first ambulance was âgranted accessâ to the mosque at 2:08p.m. â but the CCTV footage played in court on Wednesday showed paramedics entering the building seven minutes later.
The same report said that all of those killed suffered âinevitably fatal injuries which meant they would not have survived had they been evacuated [â¦] sooner.â
The inquest has yet to hear medical evidence from pathologists, doctors, or ambulance officers. Christchurchâs ambulance service, St John, is a charity and some paramedics are volunteers.",N

Guest Essay
The Republicans Who Want to Invade Mexico
Mr. Grandin is a professor of history at Yale and the author, most recently, of “The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America.”
As president, Donald Trump reportedly floated the idea of shooting “missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs.” When his defense secretary, Mark Esper, raised various objections, he recalls that Mr. Trump responded by saying the bombing could be done “quietly”: “No one would know it was us.”
Well, word got out and the craze caught on. Now many professed rebel Republicans, such as Representatives Mike Waltz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, along with several old G.O.P. war horses, like Senator Lindsey Graham, want to bomb Mexico. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said he would send special forces into Mexico on “Day 1” of his presidency, targeting drug cartels and fentanyl labs. In May, Representative Michael McCaul, another Republican, introduced a bill pushing for fentanyl to be listed as a chemical weapon, like sarin gas, under the Chemical Weapons Convention. This move targeted Mexican cartels and Chinese companies, which are accused of providing the ingredients to the cartels to manufacture fentanyl.
Of course, the United States is already fighting, and has been for half a century, a highly militarized drug war — in the Andes, Central America and, yes, Mexico — a war as ineffective as it has been cruel. Hitting fentanyl labs won’t do anything to slow the bootlegged versions of the drug into the United States but could further destabilize northern Mexico and the borderlands, worsening the migrant refugee crisis.
Addiction to fentanyl, a drug that is 50 times stronger than heroin, affects red and blue states alike, from West Virginia to Maine, with overdoses annually killing tens of thousands of Americans. It’s a bipartisan crisis. Yet in our topsy-turvy culture wars, there’s a belief that fentanyl is targeting the Republican base. J.D. Vance rose to national fame in 2016 with a book that blamed the white rural poor’s cultural pathologies for their health crises, including drug addiction. In 2022, during his successful run for Ohio’s Senate seat, Mr. Vance, speaking with a right-wing conspiracy theorist, said that “if you wanted to kill a bunch of MAGA voters in the middle of the heartland, how better than to target them and their kids with this deadly fentanyl?” Mr. Vance’s poll numbers shot up after that, and other Republicans in close House and Senate races took up the issue, linking fentanyl deaths to Democratic policies on border security and crime and calling for military action against Mexico.
The Mexican government is in fact cooperating with the United States to limit the export of the drug, recently passing legislation limiting the import of chemicals required for its production and stepping up prosecution of fentanyl producers. And even some of the cartels have reportedly spread the message to their foot soldiers, telling them to stop producing the drug or face the consequences. Still, in a show of Trumpian excess, Mexico is depicted as the root of all our problems. Bombing Sinaloa in 2024 is what building a border wall was in 2016: political theatrics.
The United States is no novice when it comes to bombing Mexico. “A little more grape,” or ammunition, Gen. Zachary Taylor supposedly ordered as his men fired their cannons on Mexican troops. That was during America’s 1846-48 war on Mexico, which also included the assault on Veracruz, killing hundreds. Washington took more than half of Mexico’s territory during that conflict.
Reactionaries have fixated on the border for over a century, since before the Civil War, when Mexico provided asylum for runaway slaves. Over the years, newspapers and politicians have regularly demanded that Mexico be punished for any number of sins, from failing to protect property rights to providing refuge for escaped slaves, Indian raiders, cattle rustlers, bootleggers, smugglers, drug fiends, political radicals, draft dodgers and Japanese and German agents. There was a touch of evil about Mexico, as Orson Welles titled his 1958 film set on the borderlands.
Long before the Russian Revolution, hostility directed at the Mexican Revolution, which started in 1910, gave rise to a new, more militant, ideological conservatism. U.S. oilmen invested in Mexico blamed Jews for financing the revolution and raised money from U.S. Catholics to fund counterrevolutionaries, some of whom were fascists. From 1910 to 1920, private vigilante groups like the K.K.K., local police departments and the Texas Rangers conducted a reign of terror across the border states that killed several thousand ethnic Mexicans, some of whom were trying to organize a union or trying to vote.
Trumpism’s ginned-up racism against Mexicans flows from this history. It remains to be seen whether calls to bomb Mexico’s fentanyl labs will play well in the coming election cycle. Yet the rhetoric itself is a dangerous escalation of an old idea: that international narcotics production, trafficking and consumption can be deterred through military means.
Today’s Republican renegades say they represent a break from the “globalist” bipartisan consensus that governed the country through the Cold War and the decades that followed. But aside from some opposition to military aid to Ukraine, Republicans largely toe the line when it comes to the use of military force abroad. Few Republican dissidents dare question the establishment consensus on ongoing military aid to Israel, especially in light of its current siege of Gaza. In this sense, calls to bomb Mexico are a distraction, blowing smoke to hide the fact that the G.O.P. offers nothing new. Republicans certainly aren’t the peace party, as some of Mr. Trump’s isolationist backers would have us believe. All they offer is a shriller war party.
(As if to illustrate the point, as Republicans shout about Mexico, the Biden administration has quietly struck a deal with Ecuador that will allow the United States to deploy troops to the country and patrol the waters off its coast, the Washington Examiner recently reported.)
Even bombing another country in the name of fighting drugs is hardly innovative. In 1989, George H.W. Bush used the U.S. military to act on the federal indictment of Manuel Noriega, Panama’s ruler, for drug trafficking. In Operation Just Cause, the United States dropped hundreds of bombs on Panama City, including on one of its poorest neighborhoods, El Chorrillo, setting homes ablaze and killing an unknown number of its residents.
For all their posturing on how they represent a break with the past, today’s bomb-happy Republicans are merely calling for an expansion of policies already in place. Republicans have introduced legislation in the House and Senate that would in effect bind the war on drugs to the war on terrorism and give the president authority to strike deep into Mexico. Mr. Graham also says he wants “a Plan Mexico more lethal than Plan Colombia.”
Calls to inflict on Mexico something more lethal than Plan Colombia should chill the soul. Initiated by Bill Clinton in 1999, Plan Colombia and its successor strategies funneled roughly $12 billion into Colombia, mostly to security forces who were charged with eliminating cocaine production at its source. Their campaign included, yes, the aerial bombing of cocaine labs.
Conflict in Colombia is a longstanding phenomenon, but Plan Colombia helped kick off a wave of terror that killed tens of thousands of civilians and drove millions from their homes. The Colombian military murdered thousands of civilians and falsely reported them as guerrillas, as a way of boosting its body count to keep the funds flowing. Massacre followed massacre, often committed by the Colombian military working in tandem with paramilitaries. At the end of last year, Colombia had the fourth-largest population that was internally displaced because of conflict and violence, behind only Syria, Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
For what? More Colombian acreage was planted with coca in 2022 than in 1999, a year before the start of Plan Colombia. Colombia remains the world’s largest cocaine producer.
Plan Colombia did weaken Colombian drug producers and disrupt transportation routes. But it also incentivized Central American and Mexican gangs and cartels to get in the game. Drug-related violence that had largely been confined to the Andes blasted up through the Central American isthmus into Mexico.
Then in 2006, with support from the Bush administration, Mexico’s new president, Felipe Calderón, did what today’s Republican would-be bombardiers want Mexico to do: declare war on the cartels. Again, the result was catastrophic. Estimates vary, but by the end of Mr. Calderón’s six-year term, about 60,000 Mexicans had been killed in drug-war-related violence. By 2011, an estimated 230,000 people had been displaced, and about half of them crossed the border into the United States. Tens of thousands of Mexicans, including social activists, were disappeared, or had gone missing. The cartels, meanwhile, grew more profitable and powerful.
In the wake of this failure, the current Mexican government, led by Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has de-escalated the conflict to focus more on policing and prosecution. Other Latin American leaders, across the political spectrum, want to call off the war on drugs altogether and begin advancing decriminalization and treating excess drug use as a social problem.
For now, calls to bomb Mexico are mostly primary-season bluster. But if a Republican were to win the White House in 2024, he or she would be under pressure to make good on the promise to launch military strikes on Mexico. Those efforts are not just bound to fail; they also could even make matters worse. Fentanyl labs are hardly complicated operations — with a couple of plastic drums and a pill press, one cook in a hazmat suit can turn out thousands of doses in a day. Trying to eliminate them with drones and missiles would be as effective as bombing bodegas in the Bronx. Hit one lab and five more pop up, perhaps in more populated areas.
Further militarizing Mexico’s drug war would lead to more corruption, more deaths, more refugees desperate to cross the border. And those displaced, if Republicans had their way and Mexican cartels were classified as terrorist organizations, would have a better shot at claiming asylum, since they would be fleeing a formally designated war zone.
With each escalation of the drug war, its horrors have inched closer to the United States. Now war mongering threatens to destroy the fragile movement among U.S. policymakers toward a more humane approach to drug use, that possession and use of drugs shouldn’t bring draconian prison sentences and that addiction should be treated as an illness, rooted in class inequality. Republican calls to go hard against narcotics below the border can’t but rebound above it, leading back to a callous public policy that treats addicts as enemies. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said of another war, the bombs we drop there explode here.

Their Neighbors Sought Revenge.
For people in Bilozerka, the invasion began a cat-and-mouse game of collaboration and resistance.
Supported by
James Verini and Paolo Pellegrin have been documenting global conflicts for decades. This is their fourth article reported from the war in Ukraine in a continuing series for the magazine.
Andriy Koshelev steered his car into the driveway of his home on Pushkin Street in Bilozerka, a lakeside town in Ukraine’s Kherson region. Leaving the car on, Koshelev got out and walked to the entrance gate. He reached down to loosen the latch. When he pulled it, the gate exploded. Koshelev’s parents, who lived on the same property, rushed outside as acrid smoke filled their driveway and the street. The explosion resounded across town.
Bilozerka was near the front line in occupied territory, and the townspeople knew a shelling when they heard one. This was not that. The explosion came suddenly, without the air-tearing screech that precedes an incoming shell. Stepping out of the ambulance, the medics sensed this, too — they could smell the remnants of a bomb. “The scent of the explosive was so strong that I started sneezing,” one medic told me. They found Koshelev’s car, its engine running and its headlights on. Then they found Koshelev. The blast had hurled him through the gate. He lay beneath its bent bars, shrieking. Among the wreckage were bits of metal shrapnel; he had apparently tripped an explosive wired to the gate.
The medics knew who Andriy Koshelev was. By that night — Oct. 7 of last year — he was infamous in Bilozerka. Before the Russian invasion, Koshelev worked in his parents’ butcher shop. After it, his neighbors say, he became an official in the new government. It was commonly believed that he’d won this sudden career advancement by collaborating, a belief that became even more common when, a week before the explosion, Koshelev appeared in a video celebrating Russia’s announcement that it had annexed Kherson. “We extend enormous gratitude,” he said, “to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, the president of the Russian Federation.” The video quickly circulated on social media; the medics had seen it. As they bandaged Koshelev’s legs, loaded him onto a spine board and took him to a hospital, they surmised what had most likely happened: The Ukrainian resistance had gotten to him.
When I arrived in Ukraine, in June of this year, Bilozerka had been liberated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the Kherson region was now split in two, with its right bank, north of the Dnipro River, once again Ukrainian, and its left bank, south of the river, still occupied. I met Vlada Bahinska and Hryhorii Pelykh, two of the medics who treated Koshelev, at the town’s hospital. The medics reconstructed for me what they believed had happened when Koshelev returned home that day, and they described his condition.
“His thigh bone was shattered,” Pelykh told me. “We found out later a leg was amputated.”
“And he was minus a testicle,” Bahinska added.
“Sliced off with a shard of glass,” Pelykh said. “So accurate.”
They could hardly hide their satisfaction. Really, they made no effort to. Why should they? Koshelev had gotten what he deserved, as far as they were concerned. At least now the man might come to know something of the suffering he’d helped bring upon his neighbors.
Eight months after liberation, that suffering hadn’t stopped. The Kakhovka Dam had just been destroyed, presumably in an effort to slow the Ukrainian summer counteroffensive, and some of Bilozerka’s streets on the shore of the local lake, which the Dnipro feeds, were still flooded. The flooding had pushed back Russian positions on the far bank of the river, but the town was still within enemy tank and artillery range. Ukrainian tanks were stationed in fields around Bilozerka. Talking on the floor of the hospital’s basement, the medics and I listened to the two sides trading fire. The blasts rattled the walls. When it quieted down, we could make out, in the distance, the shelling of Kherson City, where civilians were fleeing the floods.
Ukrainian government prosecutors have opened 17,000 investigations into crimes committed in Kherson, where, during the occupation, civilians were held captive, interrogated, tortured and murdered in a system of ad hoc jails. (The jail system is still operating on Kherson’s occupied left bank.) The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin for suspected involvement in the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. The medics told me they expected such cruelty from Putin and his army. What surprised them, what pained and incensed them, was that the Russians occupied Kherson with the help of ordinary Ukrainians like Andriy Koshelev. The butcher had been joined in his disloyalty, it appeared, by teachers, farmers, shopkeepers, businesspeople, a priest.
Months on, people there were still expressing their disbelief at the extent of the betrayal. “I was extremely shocked,” a community leader named Sergiy Smutchenko told me. “People born in Ukraine, who spoke Ukrainian, who’d lived in Ukraine all their lives, turned out to be Russian.” He and just about everyone else I spoke with offered some variation of the sentence, “I didn’t know whom to trust.”
Kherson is not unique in this. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that hundreds of Ukrainians are under investigation for treason or related offenses. The problem stretches further back than this war and his tenure. For years, Russia has been suspected of infiltrating not just the Ukrainian security services but also its regular military branches, its police forces, its politicians and business elite. In 2014, Russia was able to seize Crimea and back an insurgency in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine in part because many Ukrainians in those places helped it do so. There is mounting evidence that something comparable took place last year in Kherson: Russian troops overran most of the region in just a few weeks.
As the Ukrainian counteroffensive continues, more towns like Bilozerka will be liberated. In every one of them, the residents will face the same challenge: Having survived the occupation, they now have to survive one another. Accused collaborators will be living next door to Ukrainians who resisted. Some of the accused will, like Andriy Koshelev, be attacked, and some killed — many already have been. Some will be prosecuted under a sweeping new wartime law. But the evidence against many potential cooperators is circumstantial or anecdotal, enough to make them suspect but not to get them investigated. They will stay in their towns, free but despised. When I spoke with a car mechanic named Oleksandr Guz, who was tortured by Russian captors, outside his Bilozerka repair shop, a man drove by in an ancient Lada. Guz looked at the car and, as casually as if he were pointing out one of the local waterfowl, said, “There goes a collaborator.” On his phone, Guz pulled up a picture of the man, a farmer, waving a flag at the Russian Victory Day parade. “He grows strawberries.”
Bordered by crop fields, cattle farms, dairies and the bilo zerka — “White Lake,” which gives the town its name — Bilozerka is a farming-and-fishing community that sits 10 miles west of the regional capital, Kherson City. Before the war, it had roughly 22,000 people. Last February, as the rest of the world eyed Moscow, the members of the Bilozerka community council did not discuss what to do in the event of an invasion. The prospect wasn’t taken seriously, one councilwoman, a pharmacist named Ksenia Mishyna, told me. “Maybe 1 percent of the people thought it would happen,” she said. When Russian columns did begin pouring from Crimea into Kherson’s left bank, the regional government instructed police to flee. Town officials, like Mishyna, received no instructions. “When the war began, we just had to make the best decisions we could,” she said.
The Russians took Kherson City, the first major city to be seized, on March 2. When the citizens there gathered in anti-occupation rallies, the Russians responded with gunfire and arrests. Soon they were detaining politicians, police, veterans, journalists and activists. The mayor was arrested. In Bilozerka, reality sank in. Shop shelves cleared. With their tractors, residents piled up roadblocks of sand, concrete blocks and tires. Bilozerka, like many Ukrainian towns, had created a detachment of Territorial Defense Force reservists. Some of its members joined fighters from nearby towns and went to confront the Russians. Neighbors, including Anhelina Vetrova, a retired librarian, gathered food for them. Vetrova had liked to write sketches of scenes she observed in the library. Now she began a war diary. “We collected vegetables, fruits,” she recorded on March 2. “Our boys with Molotov cocktails going against heavy armored vehicles. Not everyone even had assault rifles.”
Town officials fled. Of her 25 colleagues on the council, Mishyna estimated, only nine remained. To some, this seemed reasonable. Ukrainians with authority were being targeted; there were rumors of torture and worse. But Valentyna Boiko, a public-school teacher in Bilozerka, told me she thought some of them left because they were “pro-Russian.” Her suspicions were warranted. The Bilozerka council included at least one official who had been a member of the Party of Regions, the political machine of Viktor Yanukovych, the president who fled Ukraine for Russia after the Euromaidan protests in 2014, touching off the invasions that year. Others shared Boiko’s suspicions. People pointed out that the Russians had taken Kherson City in days, nearly unopposed. They believed that, in the event of an invasion, Ukrainian troops were supposed to detonate the Antonovskiy Bridge, which crosses the Dnipro River. But the bridge stayed intact. Rumors of a mass betrayal within Kherson officialdom spread.
One official who did not flee Bilozerka was Oleksandr Kysil, a police commander. When he learned Kherson City was taken, Kysil stashed his uniform and set to another sort of work. He had been an elite paratrooper in the Soviet Army, fighting in Afghanistan alongside the K.G.B., and he knew that if competent Russian intelligence agents made it to Bilozerka, they would round up any police and soldiers who remained — anyone who could form an armed resistance. The agents would begin their search for these people by seizing personnel records. So Kysil helped gather the records of the Territorial Defense fighters, along with those of local police officers and veterans of the fighting in Donbas. Some of the records he burned. Others he hid in various places, including in a school. “I put them in a corner of the basement and covered them with some old desks,” Kysil told me. He buried his own records in his garden.
Russian columns were spotted outside Bilozerka in the first week of March. At first, they bypassed the town. The tanks, Tiger assault vehicles, armored personnel carriers and freight trucks continued west toward Odesa, and it seemed only a matter of time before the iconic port would be seized. But when Ukrainian forces took a stand outside Mykolaiv, the advance stalled. As more Russians arrived, they settled into Kherson haphazardly. Scenes of lost Russians asking villagers for directions were so common they became a meme. Beneath these scenes was what a Human Rights Watch news report described as “an abyss of fear and wild lawlessness.” Seemingly as unprepared for an orderly occupation as they were for serious opposition, Russian soldiers looted homes and businesses and terrorized civilians. Those who entered Bilozerka displayed no unit insignia on their vehicles or on their uniforms. They didn’t even have discernible faces — they wore balaclavas. It would never become clear if a Russian officer was put in charge of the town. Bilozerkans stayed in their homes in those first days, waiting to see how the invaders behaved.
Unafraid to go outside was the car mechanic Oleksandr Guz. Like Kysil a former paratrooper (though in the Ukrainian Army), Guz and his wife contacted their neighbors and urged them to gather for a protest at 9 a.m. on March 14 at the town’s main landmark, known as the Tank. A tank that commemorated the red Army’s pushing the Nazis from Ukraine, it sat on a plinth in Bilozerka’s central plaza, near the main commercial street and a boulevard that contains the central administration building, a public school, the cultural center and the courthouse. The Russians had already torn the Ukrainian flag from the Tank and replaced it with a Russian one. For townspeople who knew their history, the timing of the protest had a significance now turned on its head: It was on the following day, March 15, that Soviet troops liberated Bilozerka from the Germans in 1944.
Waving Ukrainian flags, the townspeople took to the streets. “Kherson is Ukraine!” they chanted. “Bilozerka is Ukraine!” In a video uploaded to YouTube by a marcher, the crowd encounters a group of Russian soldiers standing in the road. The soldiers’ body language suggests they’re unsure of what to do. A Russian convoy arrives. More soldiers jump down. The crowd taunts them. Pointing their muzzles in the air, soldiers fire off rounds. “They grabbed several men and dragged them somewhere,” Anhelina Vetrova, the retired librarian, recorded in her diary later. “They threw smoke grenades.” After heavy shooting, the townspeople “began to run away in panic.”
Oleksandr Guz never made it to the rally he organized. At 8 a.m., a Tiger came to a stop at his repair shop. Russian soldiers told Guz and his workers to lie on the ground and state their names. When Guz said his, one responded, “We’re looking for you.” A soldier slammed Guz in the head with his rifle butt. A bag was put over his head. He was driven to a roadside cafe, where he was made to strip naked. While disrobing, Guz went to unclasp his crucifix necklace.
“Keep the cross on,” a soldier instructed him.
They punched Guz until he fell to the floor.
“You shouldn’t have done this,” a man said.
They went on beating him. By the time Guz’s wife was brought to the cafe, he could barely move. Ribs and a wrist were broken. He was at home recovering, two weeks later, when the Russians arrived. This time, the bag was removed from his head in a room he didn’t recognize. His wrists were tied to a pipe running along the ceiling. A soldier kicked him in the genitals. The Russians located Guz’s broken ribs and pummeled them. When they were done, a soldier pointed his camera phone at Guz and instructed him to say he’d been beaten by Ukrainian soldiers. Guz complied.
The torture of Oleksandr Guz sowed terror in the town, but for a time after it, the Russians softened their approach. “They tried to be friendly at first,” says Andriy Piskun, a journalist who went between his home in Kherson City and his mother’s in Bilozerka during the occupation. “They wanted to be liked by the locals, to show that they’d come to Ukraine in peace.” They also wanted to co-opt the locals. An agent of the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., recruited townspeople to an occupation regime Russia was assembling. In the neighboring village, Russians approached young men on the street, offering them money and help, trying to enlist them to their cause. Piskun told me that, in Bilozerka, “everything was much more terrifying than in Kherson City.” Kherson City was much larger, and the Russians were confined mostly to the city center; if he avoided the center, he could avoid them. But in Bilozerka, “The Russians were everywhere.” Ukrainians took to calling them orcs, the mindless warriors from “The Lord of the Rings.”
With the town cut off from free Ukraine, food, vital supplies and money became scarce. Bilozerka’s sole supermarket was closed, along with the banks and the post offices, a crucial lifeline for retirees who still collected their government pension payments in cash. When Russian-made goods started arriving from Crimea, the occupying troops distributed humanitarian aid. Some Bilozerkans accepted it. Others refused. They aided one another instead. Farmers gave away grain and meat; fishermen freely distributed their catch. Neighbors shared the vegetables from their gardens; they baked bread and handed it out. Over half the townspeople were pensioners, many with chronic medical conditions. Ksenia Mishyna closed her pharmacy in Kherson City and devoted herself to getting drugs to locals. Online she made connections with suppliers in free Ukraine, and she convinced checkpoint guards to allow her to travel with the medicine. Mishyna and a network of local volunteers delivered the medicines around town. A Telegram channel, Bilozerka Chat, was created to facilitate the mutual aid.
In mid-April, as life quieted somewhat, the retired librarian Anhelina Vetrova and her husband reopened a grocery shop they owned in town. Vetrova noticed at once that, despite the deprivations, her neighbors were eating better than the occupiers. Russian military supply chains were notoriously lacking, and soldiers had to resort to buying foodstuffs from her. She wondered if it was treachery to sell to them. But they were armed. What choice did she have? And she had to concede they were polite. “So polite,” Vetrova told me, “I wanted to vomit.”
The store gave Vetrova and her Ukrainian customers a chance to study the occupiers. Alina Dibrova, a teacher, discerned a caste system. The National Guard troops, who commandeered the main public school, where they erected machine-gun nests and posted snipers on the roof, were in the main ethnic Russians. They were clean-cut and well equipped. Their uniforms were new, and their weaponry was formidable. The same was true of agents with the F.S.B. and the OMON, an intelligence and counterinsurgency agency, who took over the central administration building and courthouse. There were also many Asian and Caucasian minorities, who have done much of the frontline fighting in Ukraine, and they were often worse-equipped, wearing sneakers and older uniforms. The worst show was put on by militiamen from Donbas. “They were closer to looking like homeless people,” Andriy Dibrova, Alina’s husband and a local sports coach, told me. “Some of them were wearing Soviet-style clothing and helmets.” If the Russian soldiers were sometimes alarmingly young, the Donbas militiamen looked much too old and out of shape to be at war, and while the Russians were at first cordial, the militiamen made a point of being detestable. “They had such anger against us,” the retiree Tetiana Nechai says. “They would say: ‘I lost my home, and here I am with the Russians, because it was Ukrainian troops who did that to me. We will destroy everything here.”’ Even the Russians loathed them.
Children had become accustomed to remote learning during the Covid-19 pandemic, and with the schools closed, they returned to their online classrooms. In her language class, Valentyna Boiko gave her students essay assignments that she hoped would take their minds off the war. She had them write about “nature, the environment, animals,” she says. But of course, they couldn’t ignore the war. While they wrote, they could look up to see Russian surveillance drones hovering above their homes, or listen to rockets crashing down around them. After a shelling, Vetrova wrote, “The house was shaking, as were the doors and windows.” When the shock passed, “I immediately checked the local group chat,” and “I froze after reading about the death of Dasha, a girl I know. She came to our shop twice that day.”
Though Kyiv was still paying government workers and keeping up with pension payments to retirees, the Russians offered additional salaries and pensions, in rubles. Russian mobile and internet service were introduced. To get them, townspeople had to buy new Russian sim cards, so they learned to use virtual private networks. They didn’t use their phones in public, knowing it was the fastest way to be stopped and searched. On Bilozerka Chat, neighbors alerted one another to the location of Russian patrols, adding a warning that would become a kind of silent air-raid siren: “Erase your phones.” At home, they buried their phones in jars or bags in their gardens, along with their laptops, their official documents — anything the Russians could use to learn about them. Ukrainian TV channels disappeared, replaced by Russian ones.
When Ukrainian newspapers were replaced by Russian ones, Vetrova wrote in her diary, “I wanted to shout: ‘People, come to your senses! Don’t read this Russian propaganda!’” She was cheered when the shops around hers reopened, because “small stores became the place of daily new information, discussion, the place of common hopes and expectations for the inhabitants of the town,” she wrote. One man came into the shop and, “as he was getting ready to leave, looked around (there was no one there) and confidently told me: ‘Glory to Ukraine!’”
Tetiana Nechai opened a small grocery of her own. Her first pair of Russian customers “looked 16 years old,” she says. When they lowered their rifles, the muzzles nearly touched the floor. “My God, you’re children,” she said to them. “What are you doing here?”
“We’re not going to kill anyone,” one said.
“I don’t know if you’re going to kill anyone, but you’ve come in with machine guns,” she said. “What would you like?”
“Apples,” they said.
“I felt so sorry for those two,” she told me. “They were kids who wanted apples. How could I refuse?”
Nechai saw that the Russians patiently waited in line and never tried to shortchange her. Some were even talkative, though they wouldn’t speak about the war. Mostly they wanted to discuss how good Ukrainian fruit was. “They praised the strawberries so much, you’d think they’d never had a strawberry,” she says. “I told them that we would be getting cherries later in the season. They didn’t know what a cherry was.” She did have one Russian customer willing to discuss the war. He told Nechai he’d come to fight not Ukraine but NATO. The country was crawling with NATO troops, he assured her.
One day, a more imposing Russian came in. Nechai took a chance. “Do you understand that everything has changed dramatically since you arrived?” she said to him. The war had split her family. Nechai’s daughter-in-law is Russian. Her daughter-in-law’s parents used to visit Ukraine every year. They were intelligent people, a teacher and a university lecturer. But Russian propaganda had sapped them of all reason. They cut off contact with her. They begged their daughter to return to Russia before she was killed by Ukrainian fascists. Nechai’s granddaughter adored her grandfather in Russia. Now he refused to talk to her. The girl was heartbroken. She had fled Bilozerka with her mother and Nechai’s son. Nechai told the Russian all this. He heard her out with interest. She told him she wanted him to return to his family alive.
“You are a stranger here, I don’t know anything about you,” she said to him. “Where in Russia are you from?”
“Russia,” he said.
“You see, you can’t even tell me what city you’re from,” she said to him, or “what kind of family you have.”
“You know, I’m just a soldier,” he told her. “Let the politicians decide. It’s not up to me.”
The war was not going according to plan for Russia. Kherson City turned out to be the only regional capital it would take. From Kyiv to Kharkiv, its troops were being beaten back by Ukrainian forces. Tens of thousands of Russians had already been killed or wounded. Outside Mykolaiv, where the Russian westward advance had been decisively stopped, Russian corpses were piling up, and as spring turned to summer in Bilozerka, the cracks in the ranks began to show. Even the national guardsmen, usually so disciplined, were now drinking in public. Bilozerkans did their shopping early so they could get inside before the nighttime drunken fights between the Russians and the Donbas militiamen.
The ingratiation ended. The Russians spray-painted “orcs” on their vehicles. Now they didn’t just search homes but raided and tossed them, looking for weapons and anything that suggested Ukrainian patriotism. Increasingly, F.S.B. and OMON agents accompanied the soldiers, asking the same questions: “Who do you know in the Territorial Defense? Who is working against us?” If they refused to talk, local men were beaten in their homes, in their driveways, in their gardens, in front of their wives, their children. They were pistol-whipped, cut with knives, shocked with stun guns, made to kneel for mock executions.
The townspeople noticed that, despite their efforts to hide their phones and computers and documents, the Russians seemed to know more about them with every new round of searches. They had long suspected there were local informers about. When Russians came to the home of the teacher Valentyna Boiko, they already knew her son was in the navy. “There was no point in hiding it,” she told me. “They knew everything about everyone.” Taken from their house, he was kept for two days, for part of that time in a pit in the earth. He returned to his mother with broken ribs and a gashed face, his body covered in bruises.
The Russians may have learned about him because they had discovered the personnel records that Oleksandr Kysil, the police commander, hid when the invasion began. Kysil had a contact who kept an eye on the school where he stashed them. The contact reported to Kysil that when the Russians first searched it, they left empty-handed. “The second time, they removed the desks and found the records,” Kysil told me. “Someone must have snitched.”
Kysil couldn’t be certain who snitched, but he had a good idea of where to start looking. Volodymyr Saldo, whom the Russians had installed as the head of Kherson’s occupation regime, had been a fixture of Kherson politics for 20 years. After serving as mayor of Kherson City, Saldo was a member of Parliament, where he represented the pro-Russian Party of Regions. When that party was disbanded, Saldo formed his own, the Party of Saldo, and when the war began, he joined the openly collaborationist Salvation Committee for Peace and Order. In May, Saldo appeared on the state news channel Russia24 to say that “Life is slowly getting back on track and taking on a peaceful character.” From Bilozerka’s central administration building was hung a banner reading “With Russia Forever.”
Saldo appointed new administrations in towns across occupied Kherson. May 9 is Victory Day in Russia, when the nation celebrates the defeat of Germany in World War II. Commemorating it in Moscow, Putin likened the Ukraine war to Russia’s Great Patriotic War against Germany. (He added that it was also a “pre-emptive attack” against NATO and America.) Saldo organized celebrations across Kherson. Troops gathered in the streets. It wasn’t a startling sight: Ukraine had celebrated Victory Day until 2016. What was startling was that the occupiers were joined by Ukrainians. A lot of Ukrainians. There had always been a few people around town, mostly pensioners, who were openly pro-Russian. Their neighbors dismissed it as so much pitiable Soviet nostalgia. But on Victory Day, Ukrainians of all ages turned out. A student told me she was shocked to see classmates of hers running to the Tank, waving Russian flags. Friends said to her, “Maybe it would be better if the Russians just took over.”
Russian camera crews were on hand to shoot propaganda segments. The subject of one was a woman named Iryna Kozlyonkova, a former teacher and member of the Bilozerka council, where she’d directed the education department. She’d been a member of the Party of Regions and then the Party of Saldo. Saldo made her head of Bilozerka’s new government. Kozlyonkova approached townspeople, offering them jobs in her regime. They did not have to accept, she told them, but if they didn’t, they had three days to leave town, per Russian orders.
On June 20, she convened a meeting of her former colleagues in the education department at the central administration building. One who attended was Andriy Dibrova, the sports coach. He and the others were ushered into a conference room, where they were met by Kozlyonkova and an F.S.B. agent. Outside it stood armed soldiers in balaclavas. Kozlyonkova addressed the assembled townspeople in Ukrainian. “She said that she was scared like the rest of us, and that Volodymyr Saldo was scared, too,” Dibrova recalls. “But they had made a decision and thought it was correct, because Russia would be here forever.”
The F.S.B. agent rose to speak. He appeared to Dibrova to be Asian or Caucasian. “Russia is a multicultural nation,” he said, in Russian. “I am not Russian, either. But Russia is here forever, and you are under the protection of Russia. We want you to work with us. Those of you who don’t want to work with us, don’t interfere. If we learn you’re interfering, we will speak with you in a different tone than I am now, and in a different place.”
After the meeting, Kozlyonkova approached Dibrova. She wanted to give him a leading role in the new education department. He declined. He was given three days. He and his family fled. Antonina Cherednyk, the former Bilozerka council head, was arrested and taken to Kozlyonkova’s office. Kozlyonkova told her that, under Russian control, the agricultural firm that Cherednyk managed would expand, and Cherednyk would personally profit. Cherednyk asked her why she was helping the Russians. Kozlyonkova said that she didn’t want to abandon the people of the town, and Russia was offering them better opportunities. Cherednyk refused to join her, but many others did not, and Kozlyonkova assembled a cadre
When I asked Bilozerkans about the types of collaborators they knew, I heard a taxonomy: There were the older Soviet nostalgists, usually pensioners, who missed what they remembered as the stability and pride of life in the U.S.S.R. and believed Putin could recreate it; there were the “zombies,” the people who lapped up Russian propaganda, even the most obvious lies, like the claim their nation was a NATO puppet state led by a Jewish fascist; the “konservas,” or “tin cans,” the people with not much going on in life who just needed to be approached and cracked open; and the “waiters,” the fence-sitters who waited to see how the war went, so that they could align themselves with the winning side. Most belonged to that last category, I was told, including most of Kozlyonkova’s staff. The betrayal that stung most was that of Anatoliy Korniev, the priest at St. John of Kronstadt, an Orthodox church in town. Korniev distributed aid and sheltered people in the church at the start of the war, but the Russian Orthodox Church backed Putin, and soon enough Korniev told parishioners that Russia was here to stay. They should adjust to the new reality.
It seemed obvious to me that some townspeople would have collaborated out of fear or the need to survive. But when I made this point to loyalists in Bilozerka, it was usually dismissed. The underlying motivation was simple selfishness, they said. They thought the collaborators weren’t even pro-Russian, just pro-themselves, with no more ideology than loyalty. The occupation was a chance to advance their careers, to improve their stations, to collect an extra pension check or just make a little extra cash. This explanation went for everyone from Kozlyonkova down to the strawberry farmer whom Oleksandr Guz pointed out at his repair shop, who was barely making it around the corner in his sputtering sedan. If he’d gained anything from Russia, it evidently hadn’t been much. (I could not reach any of the accused collaborators from Bilozerka or Volodymyr Saldo.)
One woman, Alyona Zelinska, had a different theory. A researcher with a nonprofit government watchdog group in Bilozerka, Zelinska investigated Kozlyonkova for misusing state funds before the war. To be sure, she told me, Kozlyonkova was part of an “amoral group of people.” But her betrayal didn’t derive just from selfishness. Kozlyonkova had a cynical “philosophy of life” that was more complex and inherited, Zelinska believed. She learned to be cynical in the waning days of the Soviet Union, a survival instinct of a people raised amid coercion and deceit. “What were we taught in the Soviet Union?” said Zelinska, who was 12 years old when Ukraine became independent. “The children march in line. Don’t stand out, and everything will be OK. That is what Sovietism is.” Kozlyonkova and other accused collaborators were “leftovers of this herd mentality.” She had used the war for personal gain, giving up on the idea that Ukraine could improve on the sclerotic empire from which it broke off a generation ago. Forsaking the promise of a more decent life that was their young republic: For Zelinska, that was the real treachery.
The defection no one understood was that of Andriy Koshelev. Koshelev and his wife, a nurse in the surgical ward at the hospital, were well liked in town. They shared the property on Pushkin Street with his parents. His mother was a popular teacher at the main public school, and she and his father owned the butcher shop where Koshelev worked. Koshelev was kind and humble, according to Oleksandr Shcherbyna, a friend of his. So humble, indeed, that he was “a completely unnoticeable figure.” At the beginning of the occupation, he and Koshelev waited on food lines together and talked about the war. “He would emphasize that he was pro-Ukraine,” Shcherbyna says, “that he was categorically against the Russians.” When the shelling was bad, Koshelev’s wife would bring people to the basement of the hospital to take shelter. The coach Andriy Dibrova and his wife, Alina, lived nearby, and Alina was friendly with her. They saw each other during the occupation and commiserated over the situation. No one in the family had ever been heard to express pro-Russian views before the war. As far as I could determine, none of the accused collaborators had.
Nevertheless, soon after taking up their posts, they were outed online. In addition to the mostly innocuous local forums like the Telegram channel Bilozerka Chat, there were partisan forums devoted to shaming Russian helpmeets. The administrators of Bilozerka Chat knew the channel was being monitored by Russian intelligence, and they erased posts that would raise suspicion. The administrators of the partisan forums clearly wanted to raise suspicion — to let accused collaborators know that they were being monitored, too. A photo of a smiling Koshelev was posted on the Telegram channel Database of Traitors of Kherson, along with his home address.
As more collaborators were accused, the distrust even among loyalists grew. It appeared anyone, no matter how patriotic they’d once been, could turn. “They were normal people, worked alongside each other, had wonderful families,” the teacher Valentyna Boiko says. “Then you find out they’re working with the Russians.” Ukrainian barkeepers sold the Russians vodka and beer. Townspeople drank with them. Some local women were openly dating occupiers. On Aug. 22, two days before Ukrainian Independence Day, a sort of counterfestival was put on by the Russians. Vetrova wrote in her diary that an elderly woman, who “used to be patriotic,” came into the shop and defended her decision to attend the festival: The Russians “gave me two pensions,” the woman said. “They give out humanitarian aid free of charge, they hand out bread free of charge, my daughter was given a job. I’m going to go!” Vetrova lamented, “We live now not only under occupation, but also among traitors.”
Vetrova didn’t mention that they also lived among patriots. There was a reason the Russians were still searching homes for weapons and pressing with ever-greater brutality for the names of veterans and reservists. The underground didn’t just exist online. It was real and it was armed. Referred to as rukh oporu, the resistance movement, it was decentralized, with partisans working in cooperation with the Ukrainian Armed Forces and secret service, or S.B.U., and on their own. Though attribution can’t be confirmed, it was credited with a string of assassinations: A pro-Russian blogger was shot dead in Kherson City. The head of the Department of Family, Youth and Sports in Volodymyr Saldo’s administration was blown up in his car. A deputy of Saldo’s died in a suspicious car accident, and an assistant was shot dead while sitting in his Mercedes near Saldo’s house. Though her home was close to her office in the administration building, Iryna Kozlyonkova took to commuting by car in a bulletproof vest and helmet, accompanied by bodyguards. The townspeople found the spectacle ridiculous, but her caution was wise. Oleksandr Kysil, the police commander, told me he was tracking her and her cadre through a network of counterinformants.
Kysil took a leading role in the resistance. Well connected in the U.A.F. and S.B.U., he devised a system to help with their precision missile strikes. A lifelong hunter, Kysil had an intimate knowledge of the landscape and had hunting friends across the villages and farms on the right bank. He recruited spotters throughout the area. They kept tabs on Russian troop and equipment movements and gathered at Kysil’s house for a regular backgammon game that was actually an intelligence-sharing meeting. After he had confirmed a current Russian position with multiple sources, he would relay the intelligence to his government contacts. He monitored the strikes on his phone through the spotters, standing atop a ladder in his attic to get a cell signal. If a strike was off-target, he’d try to help correct fire. He and the spotters spoke in hunting code. Kysil described the process to me this way:
“I would get a call from another hunter. I would tell him, ‘Do you remember where we barbecued when we opened the hunting season? We barbecued at Khvylia.’ The Russians had just entered there. He would say, ‘Yeah, I remember.’ And I would say, ‘We should roast something there again.’” This meant a strike had missed its target. The spotter would go out, reconnoiter, determine how off the missile had been and call Kysil back. Kysil would then relay the information to the artillerists, who would recalibrate and fire again. “Later he calls and asks, ‘How’s the barbecue?’ And I tell him, ‘It’s fine, we’ve grilled all the meat.’”
Loyalists with less expertise did what they could. There were U.A.F. and S.B.U. Telegram and Signal channels on which people could report Russian positions and upload photos. For those who didn’t feel safe having those channels on their phones, Kyiv had installed a hidden portal in Diia, the government mobile application on which Ukrainians store their state documents. If the user followed a certain link, the application took them to an embedded page where they could relay information. Others took greater chances. Volodymyr Zheludenko, a former head of the Stanislav community council, strapped fishing rods to his motorcycle and rode around the waterways of the area, looking for Russian positions and noting their locations. When he was stopped at a checkpoint or by a patrol, he would explain that, with no work and little food, he had resorted to catching and selling fish. Antonina Cherednyk found cans of blue and yellow spray paint and went out in the dark, writing “UAF is coming” at bus stops, on roadways and on fences. When Alyona Zelinska learned of the graffiti, she told me, she was “filled with hope.”
At the Bilozerka hospital, most of the doctors had fled, but almost all the emergency medics had stayed on, including Bahinska and Pelykh. The ambulance service forced the medics to sign agreements saying they would treat injured Russians. The indifference of Russian commanders to the lives of their troops was well known: Images of Russian injured and dead abandoned on roadsides and in fields were another morale-boosting meme for Ukrainians. But the Russians in Bilozerka didn’t trust the Ukrainian medics with their lives, either. Bahinska was never abused, but Pelykh said he was beaten and robbed by an occupier. “They rarely called us,” Bahinska said. “They were afraid we’d kill them.”
One time, Pelykh and Bahinska were on their way to a call when a Russian armored personnel carrier cut them off. Inside it was a soldier perforated with shrapnel and in dire shape. A Russian medic had tied on an arterial tourniquet ineptly, and the man was bleeding out. The soldiers forced Bahinska and Pelykh to put him in their ambulance and speed him to a clinic in Kherson City. Pelykh kept the injured man alive, but only just. “Let’s just say,” he told me, “that he could have been handed over in a condition that came with better prospects than disablement or death.”
Last summer, as the partisans killed more accused collaborators, a Ukrainian counteroffensive gained momentum, pushing Russians in the Mykolaiv region back toward Kherson. The parade of Russian casualties became constant. A woman told me: “We became hard. We learned to enjoy the sight of Russian bodies coming through.” The closer the Ukrainian troops got, the more desperate the occupiers got. They began conscripting Ukrainian men into the Russian Army. The more Russian troops were killed with the help of Kysil and others, the more Ukrainians were abducted. Dawn brought the sound of Tigers and A.P.C.s screeching to a halt at houses, doors being kicked in, people being dragged off.
The Russians had established a system of ad hoc jails across Kherson, in government buildings, schools, courthouses, police stations and elsewhere. Captives were held for days, weeks, even months. They were interrogated for intelligence, but the larger goal seems to have been to stamp out Ukrainian patriotism and break wills. They were beaten with truncheons, shocked with electricity, subjected to sexualized torture. Men were stripped naked and live wires attached to their genitals. The prisons were manned by soldiers and F.S.B. and OMON agents, and, eventually, agents with Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service. The most sadistic guards were often the Donbas militiamen. This stood to reason: The template for the detention system in Kherson seems to have been based at least in part on the system Russians and Ukrainian collaborators created in Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014 to terrorize civilians there.
Ukrainians referred to the jails as “the basements.” When someone disappeared, it was said they were “in the basement.” No one knows yet just how many basements there were in Kherson. Researchers with Global Rights Compliance, a human rights foundation supporting Ukrainian prosecutors, estimates it may have been more than 35. Nor is the total number of captives who passed through the system known. Ukrainian prosecutors have identified 700 cases of detention in Kherson City alone. In Bilozerka, there was a basement in the main school and a more dreaded one in the courthouse. The courthouse building is across the street from the hospital, and Bahinska recalls that when the courthouse windows were open, she could hear the screams of the victims. Ivan Samoylenko, the head of the Stanislav council, was taken there. “When I saw the blood on the floor and the ropes hanging from the walls,” Samoylenko told me, “I knew I was in for it.”
Perhaps the most ghoulish basement was in a police station in Kherson City. That is where Antonina Cherednyk, the former Bilozerka council head, was taken the third time she was arrested. She and roughly 100 other inmates, by her count, slept on wood planks on the floor. They were barely fed and given no medical care, and they used plastic bottles for toilets. She was interrogated and tortured repeatedly. Wires attached to a battery were clipped to her fingers and water poured over them, and then she was shocked. She overheard what she believes were the rapes of male prisoners. While she was there, three male prisoners accused of being partisans were shot dead. She and other victims I interviewed were forced to record videos in which they were made to say that they had been abused by Ukrainian forces, or that they supported Russia, or both. Released after 18 days, Cherednyk returned to Bilozerka barely able to stand. The United Nations special rapporteur on torture reported earlier this year that the torture was so ubiquitous and systematic, it amounted to Russian state policy.
Still, all the torture couldn’t stem the flow of intelligence to Kyiv. On Sept. 15, 2022, heads of various occupation administrations from around occupied Kherson gathered at the central government building in Kherson City. Five Ukrainian missiles slammed into the building.
A week later, voting in the referendum to make Kherson a part of the Russian Federation began. Volodymyr Saldo announced, “We have set the course for reunification with Russia and will not deviate from it.” Iryna Kozlyonkova issued a statement to the people of Bilozerka: “I urge you to decide who we will live with in the future. Will we continue to endure this lawlessness or join the Russian Federation?”
Kozlyonkova’s underlings drove around town in military vehicles with ballot boxes and knocked on doors. If the inhabitants answered their doors, they were instructed to mark a plus or a minus on a ballot as rifle-wielding soldiers stood over them. Many people didn’t answer. Many houses were skipped. Some refused to vote. Nonetheless, the Kremlin announced the referendum passed by 87 percent. On Sept. 29, in Moscow, Vladimir Putin signed a decree annexing Kherson, which, for him, was a particularly important prize. He refers often to Grigory Potemkin, the statesman who undertook the first Russian annexation of Kherson, in the 18th century. In the speech marking last year’s annexation, Putin called Kherson Novorossiya, or New Russia, Potemkin’s name for it. “This is the will of millions,” he said. In Kherson, “Catherine the Great and Potemkin founded new cities.” Now its people “have become our citizens, forever.”
On Sept. 30, Andriy Koshelev recorded his video. Addressing the camera from in front of the Bilozerka cultural center, he spoke rapidly, like a man trying to get through a wedding vow he didn’t write. From his clasped hands protruded a souvenir-size Russian flag. “Today, a historic event is taking place, which we’ve been awaiting for a very long time,” he said. “Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin yesterday signed a decree recognizing the Kherson Oblast as independent.” About 50 people stood behind him, also holding Russian flags, large and small. He raised the little flag, clapped, and then chanted: “Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia! Putin! Putin! Putin!”
Some Bilozerkans told me that the annexation left them feeling truly hopeless for the first time. Maybe Russia really will be here forever, they thought. More local homes had been taken over by the occupiers. Tetiana Nechai lost heart when a Russian soldier, a regular customer in her grocery, confided that he liked the town so much, he planned to stay. He’d picked out the piece of land he would confiscate. “We were feeling quite depressed,” Alyona Zelinska says, “because everyone was expecting the counteroffensive. But it seemed there were just so many Russian soldiers, and they were all so angry.” In her diary, Anhelina Vetrova recorded: “Recently, no sounds of liberation can be heard. Everything fell silent. I am most afraid that we will be abandoned like Crimea.”
In October, not long after partisans nearly killed Andriy Koshelev, Bilozerkans noticed the ranks of the occupiers thinning. Within weeks of Putin’s decree, his troops were in retreat across Kherson’s right bank, their battered columns trundling back the way they came, toward Kherson City and the Dnipro River. When Ukrainian forces got within 30 miles of Bilozerka, Tetiana Nechai saw a soldier she knew, who was drunk and weeping. “I don’t want this war, I don’t want to kill anyone — I want to go home,” he told her. “I can’t even surrender. We are not allowed to.” By then, even she had lost all sympathy. The last occupier she saw up close was a driver whose truck was being loaded in a final round of looting. “I hope you die,” she told him.
In a video address to residents of Kherson’s right bank, Volodymyr Saldo said, “Dear fellow countrymen, we all know that Ukraine has declared total war on Russia.” Saldo exhumed Potemkin’s bones from a cathedral in Kherson City so they wouldn’t be harmed in the coming invasion. He also offered free passage to the left bank or Crimea to anyone who wanted it. Simultaneously, Kyiv urged citizens to evacuate to free Ukraine.
As the rockets rained down, the National Guard troops vacated their barracks in the public school. Then the other billets cleared out. Vehicles and equipment vanished overnight. By the first week of November, the checkpoints stood empty. There were a few tragicomic final scenes — a drunken occupier stood in a plaza, firing into the air, until he was confronted. When Vetrova went to her shop in the morning, she found a bullet hole in the wall across from where she normally stood. On Nov. 9, the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered troops to abandon Kherson City. The Antonivsky Bridge was finally blown up, and the occupiers were forced to commandeer civilian boats to cross the river. As the Russians fled, so did Kozlyonkova and her cadre.
Cell service cut out, then the electricity. Isolated again, Bilozerkans didn’t know what to expect. Once more, they hunkered down in their homes. “What else did the bloodthirsty dwarf come up with?” Vetrova wrote in her diary, referring to Putin. “Are we trapped?”
The last occupiers were seen driving out of Bilozerka on Nov. 11. Within hours, Ukrainian soldiers arrived. “The streets immediately became crowded. Everyone shares the news, rejoices, women are crossing themselves,” Vetrova wrote. Bilozerkans hugged and kissed the liberators, brought them food. “Our town was awash with yellow and blue colors.” The Russian tricolor was torn from the Tank and replaced with a Ukrainian flag.
But Vetrova’s thoughts soon turned back to treachery. Neighbors who had brought food to the occupying Russian Army were now doing the same for Ukrainian troops. Teenage boys who had appeared in Russian propaganda videos were now running around shouting, ‘Glory to Ukraine!’ “What to expect from these people?” she wrote. “How to make them tear off their masks? How to clean up the country?” Some Ukrainians fear that the entire country is now fated to become like the Donbas, where accused collaborators and patriots still distrust and despise one another, nearly 10 years after the conflict there.
The first person in Kherson I spoke with when I began researching the occupation was Ivan Samoylenko, the head of the Stanislav community council. On the phone, Samoylenko told me in candid terms about his detention and torture in the Bilozerka courthouse. For five days, he said, he was questioned and beaten. When I arrived in Kherson, he was an invaluable help, introducing me around. And then, most people I interviewed in Stanislav called Samoylenko the village’s most perfidious traitor. Some had very serious accusations. A Stanislav man held in the Bilozerka courthouse believes it was Samoylenko who’d given him up to the Russians. Other residents pointed out that he’d kept his job as head of the council while other officials fled their posts, and that he had got the power lines and gas mains in Stanislav repaired with the permission of the Russians. It must mean he’d colluded with them.
I told Samoylenko about the accusations. His face fell and he took on a tone of defiance. He’d stayed in his post, he said, because he didn’t want to abandon his village and his parents, and because many villagers asked him to stay. And of course he needed Russian permission to restore the utilities. They ruled the place. How else could he have got it done? He had also implored the Russians to let locals out of detention and had organized the funerals of fallen Ukrainian soldiers. The man who believes Samoylenko betrayed him to the Russians suggested to me that Samoylenko might soon meet an ugly end. I asked Samoylenko if he feared for his life. “I don’t,” he told me, “because I didn’t do anything.”
Last year, Ukraine introduced a broad new clause to its criminal code targeting collaborators. It penalizes “cooperation with the aggressor state, its occupation administration and/or its armed or militarized formations in military, political, informational, administrative, economic and labor spheres.” The main penalty prescribed is barring the offender from public office, but prison time can be imposed. According to a U.N. report, the government has already opened 6,000 investigations into accused collaborators. A report in The Intercept found that the new law has been used to investigate “teachers showing up for work in occupied areas,” “private citizens selling hogs or other goods to Russians,” people “expressing opinions, including via social media, that are seen as supportive of the invasion” and “local officials who remained in their posts under the new authorities.”
Ivan Samoylenko is not being investigated, yet, though he has been interviewed by prosecutors. The major members of Iryna Kozlyonkova’s administration in Bilozerka are under investigation. Kozlyonkova has been charged with treason. But they all were, eventually, bit players; it is increasingly clear that Kherson was betrayed at the highest levels from the start of the war. A former police chief for Kherson is being investigated for treason, as is the onetime deputy chairman of the Kherson Regional Council, who survived a car-bombing last year. The former chief of the S.B.U. directorate in Kherson was removed from his position under suspicion of treason and the former commander of the S.B.U.’s antiterrorism center there has been officially charged. A bomb was planted on Kozlyonkova’s balcony in Bilozerka before she fled. It never detonated. Volodymyr Saldo is also charged with treason. The Russian Ministry of Defense reported that he had been poisoned in his home. If that was true, he survived, and, in December, he turned up in Moscow, where Putin presented him with a state decoration, the Order of Merit to the Fatherland.
No investigation of Andriy Koshelev has been announced. Ukrainian soldiers now live on the Pushkin Street property. It’s said he’s in Crimea. His parents’ butcher shop was shelled earlier this year. By then they, too, had fled town. There is no evidence that they collaborated. But it hardly mattered. Their neighbors made it known that the Koshelev family was no longer welcome in Bilozerka. After the land mine nearly killed him, a partisan Telegram channel posted a still from Koshelev’s video, showing him waving the Russian flag. “Look, this is andriy koshelev,” it read. He “was happy with his life” until “the Kherson partisans got to little andriy. The rest of the scum should prepare for the same fate or worse.”

Man Sought in Double Homicide Fatally Shot by Police Officers
Investigators said the man, who was killed in Brooklyn on Wednesday morning, had fatally shot a father and son after an argument over noise complaints.
New York City police officers shot and killed a man on Wednesday morning, three days after investigators said he killed a father and son inside a Brooklyn apartment building during an argument over noise.
The police had been searching for the man, Jason Pass, 47, for more than two days after the shooting deaths of the two men. The father was Bladimy Mathurin, 47, and the police named the son as Mode Chinwai, 27. Before the shooting, the city had received about half a dozen calls from Mr. Pass’s apartment complaining about noises above.
When the police arrived at 11:39 p.m. on Sunday, they found Mr. Mathurin and his son lying in the hallway of the fourth floor of the apartment on Brooklyn Avenue with gunshot wounds to the head and torso. They were pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.
“It was a particularly vicious double shooting,” said Jeffrey Maddrey, the chief of the New York Police Department, during a news conference on Wednesday.
Early Wednesday morning, police officers used license plate readers to track Mr. Pass’s vehicle. They found the black car at about 7 a.m. parked near Bay 44 Street and Bath Avenue close to Gravesend, a largely working class neighborhood.
When they approached, the driver, later identified as Mr. Pass, ran out holding a six-inch knife, the police said.
Officers chased him to 187 Bay 44th Street, where they stopped him and “contained him,” said John Chell, the department’s chief of patrol, at a separate news conference.
The officers talked to Mr. Pass for about 15 minutes “doing everything they could” to persuade him to drop the knife, Chief Chell said.
Mr. Pass told the officers that what was happening was “not going to end well,” Chief Chell said. Then, he sprinted at the officers, pointing the knife at them.
“Our officers were forced to defend themselves,” Chief Chell said. “He didn’t give us a choice.”
Mr. Pass was struck three times in the chest and once in the leg, the police said. Mr. Pass died of his injuries at Lincoln Hospital.
The police said that they were still investigating how many officers were involved and whether more than one officer struck Mr. Pass. The police did not immediately provide body camera footage of the episode and said the investigation continued.
At Mr. Pass’s apartment, a woman declined to comment or open the door, calling the situation a “tragedy.”
Late Wednesday morning, crime scene tape cut off three blocks in Gravesend. Over 20 yellow evidence markers dotted the street, showing where shell casings and evidence had been recovered.
Police officers were standing around a black Honda S.U.V. whose driver-seat door was still flung open.
Neighbors said that children had been crossing the street to get to school and commuters were heading to work when they saw the police talking to Mr. Pass before shots rang out.
Vanessa Del Carmin, 27, said she was in her kitchen getting her 5-year-old son ready for school when she heard gunfire.
“It’s a quiet neighborhood, no shootings since I’ve been here. I think that’s why everyone was surprised,” said Ms. Del Carmin, a former Marine who has lived in the neighborhood for more than three years.
At the scene of the Sunday shooting, there were bullet holes in the doors along a hallway.
Dhelma Waters, 73, a neighbor, said her husband was leaving for work Sunday night when the shooting took place. She said she saw blood in the hallway and that the ordeal was “traumatizing.”
A single bullet had gone through her front door and was lodged in a blue plastic barrel drum of evaporated milk she had planned to send to family in Jamaica.
“I’m very nervous. I sleep in the chair right behind it,” Ms. Waters said. “If we hadn’t been packing a barrel to send home, I would have been shot.”

Here’s What Doesn’t Happen After a Mass Shooting
Opinion Columnist
A few things you can bet on when there’s been a terrible mass shooting in this country.
One is that the heartbreaking stories about victims and chilling ones about the craziness of the shooter will not necessarily be followed by a strong bipartisan drive for significantly better gun laws.
POP QUIZ
After an assault-rifle-brandishing madman killed 18 people and injured 13 more in Maine, the new House speaker, Mike Johnson, was asked what to do about mass shootings. He said:
A. “Let’s ban assault weapons, pronto.”
B. “Shooting? What shooting?”
C. “Hey, I thought you said you were going to ask about impeaching Biden.”
D. “The problem is the human heart, not guns.”
Did you guess it was D, people? Perhaps we should avoid complaining until we see if Speaker Johnson proposes new legislation requiring the police to stop and search all human hearts.
Gun control — or, as its proponents prefer, gun safety — always becomes a big topic of conversation after a horrific shooting. But nothing else necessarily happens.
One of the very few serious improvements came last year when Congress finally passed a reform bill drafted by Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Who had been working on that kind of legislation for nearly a decade, ever since one crazed man with an assault rifle killed 26 people, including 20 small children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in his congressional district.
Passing the bill was quite a leap forward from the time Murphy first brought up the idea and could find only one Republican colleague even willing to sit down and discuss it. But success didn’t come until after another mass shooting at a Texas school took the lives of 19 children and two teachers.
Murphy’s bill expanded background checks for gun buyers under 21 and made it easier to keep weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. Great idea, right? Unfortunately, a federal appeals court recently declared that it’s unconstitutional to bar people from owning guns just because they have … domestic violence restraining orders against them.
Yes! That decision involved Zackey Rahimi, who was having a fight with his girlfriend in a Texas parking lot, began beating her head against the car dashboard, and then pulled his gun and fired at a bystander-witness. It was one of many, many shootings Rahimi had been accused of, and he was charged under that domestic violence restraining order law.
No no no no, said the appeals court: Remember the Second Amendment.
Now, the Rahimi case is on its way to — oh dear — the Supreme Court. A group that basically said last year that gun legislation will fly only if our founders had come up with an “analogous” measure.
“I don’t think anybody’s conceded the court will rule against us on Rahimi,” the ever-optimistic Murphy said when I called him. “If they did, it would be just an absolute, stunning blow to democracy.”
About the founders: Historians will tell you that when the Constitution was adopted, America had no significant standing army. Perfectly reasonable, therefore, that George Washington and his colleagues wanted the citizenry to be ready to rise up and fight if the British re-invaded.
I asked the senator what he thought Washington would say to him about our current gun laws if the two of them sat down for lunch. Murphy demurred: “He’d probably have a lot of other things he’d want to talk about.”
Well, yeah. Donald Trump alone would probably take up a three-course meal.
For a whole lot of people, the right to bear arms includes the right to not even bother thinking about whether you happen to be packing heat at any particular point in time. Just recently, Jeff Wilson, a Republican state senator from Washington, was arrested in Hong Kong for bringing a gun onto a plane in his carry-on luggage. Wilson claimed it was “an honest mistake.”
Lawmakers from Maine, naturally, had very strong opinions after one of their state residents, Robert Card, sprayed bullets through a bowling alley and a bar in Lewiston. Representative Jared Golden, a centrist Democrat, created a sensation back home when he announced he was going to “take responsibility” and change his longstanding opposition to an assault weapon ban.
The state’s two senators haven’t gone that far. Republican Susan Collins and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, did support one idea for reform: restricting the use of high-capacity magazines. Can’t argue about that one: We’d have less reason to fear that future mass murderers could shoot more than 10 people at a time.
On the other side, they’re backing legislation that would bar the Department of Veterans Affairs from its current practice of automatically informing the federal firearms background checkers if veterans like Card were found mentally unfit to manage their V.A. benefits. I’m sure they have good reasons on their side, but the bottom line does seem to be that folks who were judged incompetent to take care of their money would still be OK to walk around with a lethal weapon.
We’ll see what happens next. “I think it’s a race we’re winning,” Murphy told me. “It’s like a slog through molasses, but we get closer to the finish line every day.”
It’s definitely a good time to be pressing the issue. After all, election year’s around the corner. And by the way, did you know that only 12 states prohibit open and concealed carry at the polls?

Texts and letter show concerns Maine suspect would carry out shooting,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T02:38:24Z,en,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/maine-shootings-texts-letter-robert-card,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102023824id_/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/maine-shootings-texts-letter-robert-card,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102023824/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/maine-shootings-texts-letter-robert-card,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHRoZWd1YXJkaWFuKS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjMvbm92LzAxL21haW5lLXNob290aW5ncy10ZXh0cy1sZXR0ZXItcm9iZXJ0LWNhcmQ~,"A series of text messages and a letter sent from a US army reserve representative sounded the alarm about the suspected Maine gunmanâs mental health and fears that he would commit a mass shooting, according to newly released documents.
Robert Card, 40, was known to have mental health problems, authorities have confirmed since last weekâs shootings.
But newly released text messages and a letter obtained by the Boston Globe show the concern that other army reserve members had about Cardâs behavior and his ability to carry out mass violence.
Card is accused of killing 18 people and injuring at least a dozen more in two mass shootings last week at a bowling alley and bar in Lewiston, southern Maine. He was later found deceased with a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a days-long manhunt to find the suspected shooter.
In one text message sent in the early morning in September, an army reserve member identified as âHodgsonâ pleaded with an army reserve training supervisor, Kelvin L Mote, to change the password for where weapons were stored at an army reserve training center in Saco, Maine.
Hodgson also asked Mote to be armed in case Card appeared at the drill center.
âI believe heâs going to snap and do a mass shooting,â Hodgson wrote.
âI love [him] to death but I do not know how to help him and he refuses to get help or to continue help,â Hodgson wrote, referring to Card.
Hodgsonâs messages along with the letter written by Mote show the depth of Cardâs paranoia and declining mental health state.
Card began hearing voices last spring, with the problem only getting worse, Mote wrote.
During one incident on 15 July, Card accused a group of army reserve members of calling him a pedophile and other insults, shoving a member of the group in a convenience store parking lot.
The group returned to a local motel, where Card locked himself in a room and refused to come out. After the incident, Card was forced to undergo inpatient treatment at a psychiatric hospital in upstate New York.
But Mote noted that Card was still behaving erratically while hospitalized. During one four-hour visit, Card did not say a word to Mote.
âHe just stared through me,â Mote wrote.
In a separate incident in September, Card punched Hodgson while a group was driving back from a local casino.
Card had, once again, accused people of calling him a pedophile and said he was going to âshoot up the drill center at Saco and other placesâ.
When Hodgson told Card to âknock it offâ, Card punched him.
âHodgson is concerned that Card is going to snap and commit a mass shooting,â Mote wrote.
Mote forwarded Hodgsonâs concerns about Card to the Saco police department, and urged them to be cautious of Card given his experience with firearms.
âI would rather err on the side of caution with regards to Card since he is a capable marksman and, if he should set his mind to carry out the threats made to Hodgson, he would be able to do it,â Mote wrote.
In a statement to the Guardian, Addie L Leonhardt, chief of public information for the US army reserve, said US army reserve medical staff attempted to reach Card.
âThe US Army Reserve Surgeon Office and US Army Reserve medical management made multiple attempts to contact Card,â Leonhardt said.
âDue to the ongoing investigation we cannot provide further details,â she said.
The Guardian contacted a representative of the Saco police department and Mote, but did not hear back.
Five months before the Lewiston shooting, Cardâs family also alerted the Sagadahoc county sheriffâs office about Cardâs mental health and his access to firearms.
After receiving word from Cardâs family, the Sagadahoc county sheriffâs office reached out to Cardâs army reserve unit, which told them that they would speak to Card and get him medical attention.",N
From military weapon to cultural symbol: how the AR-15 has defined the US gun debate,2023-11-01,2023-11-03T02:06:38Z,en,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/ar-15-republican-american-gun-book,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103020638id_/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/ar-15-republican-american-gun-book,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103020638/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/ar-15-republican-american-gun-book,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHRoZWd1YXJkaWFuKS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjMvbm92LzAxL2FyLTE1LXJlcHVibGljYW4tYW1lcmljYW4tZ3VuLWJvb2s~,"Earlier this year, several Republican lawmakers were seen sporting a new accessory: lapel pins shaped like an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.
Andrew Clyde, a Republican congressman from Georgia who also owns a gun store, later said he had handed out the pins to his congressional colleagues “to remind people of the second amendment of the constitution and how important it is in preserving our liberties”.
The choice of an AR-15 – instead of another firearm like a handgun or revolver – shows how much the rifle has become a symbol of the gun debate in the United States. It’s now one of the most popular, and one of the most recognizable, firearms in the country.
This notoriety has come from its use in high-profile mass shootings and ongoing efforts by Democratic lawmakers to ban them. (Most recently in Maine, where 18 people were shot and killed at a bowling alley and a bar; authorities found an AR-10, a predecessor to the AR-15, in the suspected gunman’s car.) Because of these killings, the AR-15 has also become something of a rallying cry for the gun control movement.
The potent symbolism of the AR-15 is what the Wall Street Journal reporters Cameron McWhirter and Zusha Elinson say led them to write their new book, American Gun: The True Story of the AR-15. In it, they chart the more-than-six-decade history of the rifle, from its inception in a Los Angeles garage to its use in school shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Parkland, Florida, as well as at the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado.
“The AR-15 is this cultural object that everyone’s fighting about,” McWhirter said. “But nobody really understands how it developed, how it got here.”
The Guardian spoke to McWhirter and Elinson about the origins of the AR-15, how it went from military to civilian weapon and what it has come to mean in US politics. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The AR-15 has been a central part of the US gun debate for over a decade. What led you to write this book right now?
McWhirter: Zusha and I were reporting and covering mass shootings over and over again, and increasingly, they involved AR-15s. We were paired on a business story on the AR-15 and after we wrote the story, we had so much more on this history, going back to the cold war.
The AR-15 is this cultural object that everyone’s fighting about. Everyone knows the silhouette of that image, we’ve seen it a million times all over the place. If you’re for it, you put it on your bumper sticker on your car; if you put a symbol of it with a line through it on a sign, then you know what you’re saying right away without even having to use words.
Everyone’s fighting about this object, but nobody really understands how it developed, how it got here and how it became this cultural symbol that has gone far beyond the fact that it’s a gun. We wanted to understand how that happened.
So who created the AR-15, and why?
Elinson: The history of the AR-15 begins in a detached garage in Los Angeles that belonged to a former marine named Eugene Stoner, a very mild-mannered and shy fellow. He was fascinated with explosions, firearms and projectiles. He had no formal training or college education but he was trying to invent the next greatest gun, and he focused on making a lightweight rifle.
At the time, the US military was in search of a better rifle for all of its troops. We had won the second world war using this big, heavy rifle made of wood and steel. But military leaders were really afraid of all these communist threats coming up around the world. And all the guerrillas were armed with the AK-47, a gun that could fire a lot of bullets very quickly at close range.
The government felt that we needed a gun to counteract that. And into that breach steps Eugene Stoner. He uses aluminium instead of steel and an efficient, lightweight internal system, using the energy from each shot to expel spent casings and load the next round. The final result was a gun that could fire lots of bullets really rapidly, was extremely easy to shoot and keep on target. And it was just what some people in the military wanted.
How did the AR-15 go from being mainly used on battlefields to one of the most popular firearms among civilians in the US?
Elinson: ArmaLite – the company Stoner worked for – sold the rights to the AR-15 to Colt, a venerable old gunmaker. Colt decided to sell a civilian version, which they called the Sporter. It was semi-automatic, unlike the military version, but didn’t catch on in the 70s and 80s because hunters liked larger-caliber hunting rifles and were used to wood-stock rifles’ gleaming steel – they didn’t like this chintzy plastic aluminium thing.
It was an accident of politics that made this gun popular. In the early late 80s and 90s, crime was high in cities. There were a lot of shootings where people were using AK-47s and Mac-10s. Politicians and police were worried and so there’s a movement against these military-style semi-automatic guns with large magazines. The AR-15 was dragged into it.
In 1994 President Clinton signed the Federal Assault Weapons Ban with the support of Democrats, Republicans and police. At that moment, the AR-15 became a political symbol. It became a line in the sand, a symbol of second amendment rights and it drew a lot of people to the gun.
McWhirter: Because of that concern, the AR-15 became a business story, because a lot of the gunmakers who had been promoting this rifle saw a spike in sales as people were worried about the ban, then the ban went into effect. Gunmakers also learned very early on that they just had to make some modifications to the gun for it to fit the letter of the law.
Then in 2004, the Republican-led Congress let the assault weapons ban sunset. As soon as it went away, a lot of the larger gunmakers who resisted them all jumped in, because the profit was too tempting. AR-15s are easy to make and you can ramp up and reduce production really quickly. All these things are very attractive.
Simultaneously, both of these things come together with this military macho aspect of our “war on terror” to send sales of the AR-15 through the roof.
What role has the AR-15 played in the gun control movement?
McWhirter: This gun has become a symbol that people are focusing on. You still see leaders in the Democratic party talking about, “we need another assault weapons ban,” when, as we show in our book, the first one really didn’t work. And secondly, there’s more than 20m in civilian hands right now – what’s a ban going to do at this point?
Support for those movements has been very episodic, whereas gun rights groups are laser-focused on one thing. So people have to start to talk beyond this binary of guns are bad or guns are good. We need to start thinking about surgical ways to make us all safer, because that’s the bottom line.",N
Man charged in Tupac Shakur killing loses bid for lawyer representation,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T06:11:25Z,en,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/01/tupac-shakur-las-vegas-murder,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102061125id_/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/01/tupac-shakur-las-vegas-murder,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102061125/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/01/tupac-shakur-las-vegas-murder,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHRoZWd1YXJkaWFuKS9tdXNpYy8yMDIzL25vdi8wMS90dXBhYy1zaGFrdXItbGFzLXZlZ2FzLW11cmRlcg~~,"The former southern California street gang leader charged with killing Tupac Shakur in 1996 in Las Vegas has lost his bid to be represented at his arraignment by the lawyer who spoke publicly about his defense two weeks ago.
Attorney Ross Goodman told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Duane Keith “Keffe D” Davis could not meet terms of an agreement that a judge on 19 October gave them two more weeks to reach. Goodman did not specify a reason for the impasse.
Davis is due for arraignment in Nevada Thursday, and the Clark county district court judge Tierra Jones could order a financial accounting of Davis’s assets to determine whether he can afford a lawyer or she should declare him indigent and name an attorney to defend him at public expense.
Scott Coffee, a deputy Clark county public defender, said attorneys there were reviewing Davis’s case to determine whether they can represent him or they have a conflict such as having in the past represented other people involved in the case.
Officials at a county special public defender’s office, an alternate possible source of court-appointed attorneys, did not respond Wednesday to email inquiries about the Davis case. The judge also could name a defense attorney in private practice to represent Davis, at taxpayer expense.
Edi Faal, Davis’s longtime personal lawyer in Los Angeles, did not respond to telephone and email messages about Goodman’s comments. He told AP after Davis’s first court appearance on 4 October that he was helping Davis find a defense attorney in Nevada, and he confirmed Goodman’s involvement two weeks ago.
Davis, 60, is originally from Compton, California. He was arrested 29 September outside his home in suburban Las Vegas, the same day an indictment was filed accusing him of orchestrating the car-to-car shooting that killed Shakur and wounded the rap music mogul Marion “Suge” Knight. Davis is expected to plead not guilty to a murder charge that could put him in prison for the rest of his life.
Shakur died at age 25. Knight was wounded but survived. Now 58, he’s serving a 28-year prison sentence for the murder of a Compton businessman in January 2015. Knight has not responded to AP requests for comment about Davis arrest.
Goodman said on 19 October he saw “obvious defenses” in the murder case, including that police and prosecutors do not have the gun or car used in the shooting, and “there’s no witnesses from 27 years ago”.
Grand jurors were told the shooting followed a brawl in a casino on the Las Vegas strip involving Shakur and Davis’s nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson.
Anderson denied involvement in Shakur’s death and died in a May 1998 shooting in Compton at age 23. The other two men in the car with Davis and Anderson also are now dead.
Davis in recent years has publicly described his role in Shakur’s death, including in interviews and a 2019 tell-all memoir that described his life as a leader of a Crips gang sect in Compton.
Prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo told the grand jury that Davis admitted in his book that he had provided the gun, had been in the car “and that he was the on-ground, on-site commander of the effort to kill Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight”.",N
Biden to Visit Maine After Lewiston Massacre,2023-11-01,2023-11-03T01:31:46Z,en,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/politics/biden-maine-lewiston-shooting.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103013146id_/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/politics/biden-maine-lewiston-shooting.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103013146/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/politics/biden-maine-lewiston-shooting.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55dGltZXMpLzIwMjMvMTEvMDEvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvYmlkZW4tbWFpbmUtbGV3aXN0b24tc2hvb3RpbmcuaHRtbA~~,"Supported by
Biden to Visit Maine After Lewiston Massacre
The deadliest mass shooting of the year will present the president with the familiar ritual of comforting grieving families. He will likely also press his case for gun control.
Reporting from Washington
President Biden will travel to Maine on Friday to pay his respects to the 18 people killed and more than dozen wounded during a gunman’s rampage through a bar and bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, last week, the White House announced.
Shortly after the massacre, Mr. Biden declared his frustration at the taking of yet more lives in a mass shooting. The gunman, Robert R. Card II, 40, was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot on Friday, two days after the killings.
“Once again, an American community and American families have been devastated by gun violence,” Mr. Biden said on Friday as the discovery of Mr. Card’s body brought an end to a vast manhunt and lockdowns in the state. “In all, at least 18 souls brutally slain, more injured, some critically, and scores of family and friends praying and experiencing trauma no one ever wants to imagine.”
In a statement, the White House said the president and the first lady would “pay respects to the victims of this horrific attack and grieve with families and community members.” The president will also meet with emergency medical workers, nurses and other officials, the White House said.
The visit will most likely also be an opportunity for the president to repeat his call for a ban on assault weapons and tougher gun control and mental health measures that Republicans and a few Democrats have blocked on Capitol Hill.
In his statement last week, Mr. Biden said, “I once again call on Republicans in Congress to fulfill their obligation to keep the American people safe.” But with Republicans in charge of the House and Democrats only narrowly in control of the Senate, any effort to pass major gun control legislation is all but certain to die.
Maine has high rates of hunting and gun ownership and has stopped short of the “red flag” laws in other states that allow police to take guns from people who are found to be a danger to themselves or others.
Instead, Maine has a “yellow flag” law that requires the police, a mental health clinician and a judge to agree that an individual is a danger before firearms can be taken away.
The president’s visit will come as Maine’s law enforcement officials are struggling to explain why nothing was done to prevent Mr. Card’s rampage even though officials at his Army Reserve unit had warned officials of his deteriorating mental health.
Members of Mr. Card’s family and Army officials in Saco, Maine, told officials with the Sheriff’s Office in Sagadahoc County, where Mr. Card lived, that he had grown increasingly paranoid, punched a friend and said he was going to carry out a shooting rampage.
But despite those warnings, it does not appear that authorities ever contacted Mr. Card, who carried out the deadliest mass shooting of the year.
The president had already been scheduled to travel to Delaware on Friday, as he does most weekends. White House officials did not provide details about when he would leave Washington or whether he intended to keep his weekend plans.

Iran Chairs U.N.

Human Rights Council Social Forum on Thursday â just one month after Iranâs clients in Hamas perpetrated some of the worst atrocities in modern history against Israeli civilians.
UN Watch noted that Iran was granted the rotating chairmanship of the U.N. human rights forum in May. The theme for the forum in 2023 is using technology to promote human rights. Only two days before it was handed the chairmanship, the medieval Iranian theocracy executed two men for the âcrimeâ of discussing Islamâs human rights shortcomings on social media.
Six months later, Iran will assume the promised chairmanship after its terrorist proxy Hamas raped, tortured, murdered, and kidnapped more than 1,400 Israeli civilians.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: Horror of the Hamas Terror Attack on Civilians at Kibbutz Beâeri in IsraelJoel B. Pollak / Breitbart News
UN Watch has collected 90,000 signatures on a petition to overturn the absurd Iranian chairmanship. Its last-ditch drive to collect more signatures features a video posted to social media of Executive Director Hillel Neuer asking the U.N. to justify naming âa regime that beats, blinds, tortures, and rapes women who demand their rightsâ:
I asked the UN: âWhy did you name the Islamic Republic of Iran as Chair of the UN Human Rights Council Social Forum, starting on Nov. 2nd? How can you elevate a regime that beats, blinds, tortures & rapes women who demand their rights? Where is the logic? Where is the morality?â pic.twitter.com/tWefa4qA50
— Hillel Neuer (@HillelNeuer) October 30, 2023
In addition to the Hamas atrocities, Iranâs ascension to chair a human rights forum is ill-timed because another young woman was just killed for supposedly violating its hijab law, an incident Neuer alluded to in the clip above.
The victim was a 16-year-old girl named Armita Geravand, who was evidently assaulted and kidnapped by the âmorality policeâ shortly after boarding a train on October 1. As with the murder of Mahsa Amini in 2022 for a similar hijab âoffense,â Geravandâs family was compelled to tell state media interviewers that their daughter randomly collapsed for no reason and struck her head.
Video of the incident was deliberately obscured by bystanders and suppressed by the Iranian government, but one clip that escaped to the outside world showed Geravand boarding the train without wearing a hijab. Independent journalists reported Geravand was confronted by the thuggish âmorality policeâ on board the train, and one of them shoved her hard enough to strike her head against a metal object.
Geravand slipped into a coma from her head trauma and never awakened. Iranian state media reported her death on Saturday.Â
Aminiâs death at the hands of the morality police in 2022 inspired some of the largest uprisings to date against the brutal Iranian regime, which suppressed the protests with a violent crackdown that should, by itself, disqualify Tehran from holding a seat on any human rights council.
Iran was evicted from the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women (UNCSW) in December 2022 as a consequence of Aminiâs murder. The regime in Tehran has not accepted responsibility for Aminiâs death, brought her killers to justice, or implemented any human rights reforms since then. On the contrary, it has imposed even more oppressive hijab laws and more brutal enforcement.
âItâs time for all democracies at the UN to stop legitimizing murderous regimes, in violation of the world bodyâs founding principles, and instead to begin holding the perpetrators to account,â Neuer said on Monday.
He continued:
These appointments send the wrong message at the wrong time, enabling the Islamic Republic of Iran – even as it is shooting protesters in the face, raping human rights defenders in prison, and sponsoring Hamas atrocities – to strut on the international stage as a respected and influential actor.

Neuer pointed out that Iranian state media has been trumpeting its chairmanship of the U.N. forum as a historic triumph in a bid to âdishearten, dispirit, and demoralize dissidents.â
The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Michele Taylor, said in May that the United States was “appalledâ that âa country with such a deplorable human rights recordâ would be given the chairmanship of a forum.Â
Taylor said the appointment gave unwarranted legitimacy to the Iranian regime and also squandered the credibility of UNHRC and its Social Forum:
This yearâs purported focus on the role of science, technology, and innovation in promoting post-pandemic human rights rings hollow and deeply troubling in light of this appointment. It is abhorrent that Iran, notorious for exploiting these very tools to suppress human rights and curb freedom of expression, would serve at the helm of this or any human rights-related event.
On October 19, the European Union posthumously awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, its highest human rights honor, to Mahsa Amini and the âWoman, Life, Freedomâ movement her death inspired. On Thursday, the regime that killed her and used murderous violence to crush the Woman, Life, Freedom movement is scheduled to assume the chairmanship of a United Nations panel on human rights.",N

Downstairs neighbor Jason Pass killed Bladimy Mathurin and his stepson Chinwai Mode â on video â after Mathurinâs wife, Marie Delille, had words with Pass, and Mathurin, armed with a pair of scissors, confronted him.
The whole sad, ugly affair points to how far social order has decayed in New York: Four adults couldn’t resolve a basic domestic dispute without resorting to (in this case deadly) violence.
Pass â who shot Mathurin in the back, finished him off with a shot to the head, and killed Mode despite his offering no apparent threat â then calmly rode an elevator down to the street.
Police shot him fatally Tuesday during a traffic stop that he turned violent by charging cops with a knife.
That he felt the confidence necessary for either act is a testament to the damage years of anti-police rhetoric and policy can do.
As is Mathurin’s approaching his neighbor armed with scissors.
Police forces exist, above all, as visible assurance that the state will protect the law-abiding.
New Yorkâs progressive politicians have hollowed out the stateâs capacity to protect with a series of disastrous criminal justice âreforms.â
Such as bail laws that let violent, dangerous thugs go free.
And âRaise the Age,â which set off a teen shooting catastrophe by hiking the age of criminal responsibility.
Or insane discovery requirements that hamstring prosecutors.
In service to the same ideology, prosecutors themselves reduce charges or bring no case at all.
The fruits of these policies are not merely serious increases in crime (though crime is up: almost 30% over 2021, per the latest data).
They produce an overall malaise that comes from Gothamites no longer having any confidence that the justice system will do anything.
For latent sociopaths among us, itâs a license to live out their violent urges.

AUSTIN — The murder trial of a woman accused of gunning down rising pro cyclist Anna Moriah Wilson and fleeing the country began Wednesday with Texas prosecutors telling jurors they would hear Wilson's final screams and the shots that killed her.
Kaitlin Armstrong, 35, has pleaded not guilty to murder and faces up to 99 years in prison in the May 2022 slaying of Wilson, a competitive gravel and mountain bike racer. Wilson had been shot several times when she was found at a friend's home before a race that she was among the favorites to win.
""The last thing Mo did on this earth was scream in terror,"" Travis County prosecutor Rickey Jones told jurors in opening statements.
He said nearby surveillance equipment captured the screams.
""Those screams are followed by 'Pop! Pop!'"" Jones said, punching his fist into his hand for emphasis. ""You won't hear any more screams after that.""
Seconds after those shots, Jones said, ""Kaitlin Armstrong stood over Mo Wilson and put a third shot right into Mo Wilson's heart.""
In a short opening statement, defense attorney Geoffrey Puryear said Armstrong was caught in a ""web of circumstantial evidence.""
No video evidence or witnesses can put Armstrong at the scene of the shooting, Puryear said.
Police have said Wilson, a 25-year-old Vermont native, had previously dated Armstrong's boyfriend, Colin Strickland, who also was a competitive gravel racer, and had gone swimming with him earlier in the day. The trial began three weeks after authorities said Armstrong tried to escape from custody.
Prosecutors said they will show that Armstrong tracked Strickland's communications with Wilson — as well as Wilson's whereabouts — in the weeks and days before the shooting. Armstrong was able to track Wilson's location because Wilson had not turned on a safety feature on a phone app.
Armstrong's SUV was seen at the apartment where Wilson was staying the night she was killed. Police also said shell casings found at the scene matched a gun found at Armstrong's home.
Investigators quickly cleared Strickland. Prosecutors said Wednesday that video and cellphone calls, texting, and location data will confirm that he was nowhere near the shooting.
The case drew international headlines when Armstrong fled the country after her initial meeting with police, leading to a 43-day search. Investigators said she sold her vehicle for $12,000 and fled the country using her sister's name, email, credit card and passport.
Federal authorities tracked Armstrong to Costa Rica, where prosecutors said she spent $6,425 for surgery to change her appearance and used several aliases while attempting to establish herself as a yoga instructor. She also had cut and darkened her hair, and had a bandage on her nose and discoloration under her eyes when arrested at a beachside hostel.
Armstrong told police when she was arrested that she was injured in a surfing accident.
Armstrong's attorney suggested the sudden flight out of the country was not an attempt to escape justice.
""She would have no reason to know about any (arrest) warrant, You will hear Kaitlin is passionate about travelling and passionate about yoga,"" Puryear said.
The case took another turn when authorities said Armstrong tried to escape from two officers who escorted her to a medical appointment outside of the jail on Oct. 11.
Cellphone video recorded in the parking lot showed Armstrong, handcuffed and in striped jail clothes, running from an officer and trying to climb a fence. Authorities have said Armstrong appeared to plan her escape by complaining of an injury to get the outside medical appointment and have her leg restraints removed.
She faces an additional felony escape charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

An ex-con convicted of carrying out a 2020 crime spree that included the ambush-style shooting that left two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies wounded in their patrol vehicle outside a Compton transit center was sentenced Wednesday to 166 years and eight months to life in prison.
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Connie R. Quinones imposed the maximum sentence on Deonte Lee Murray, citing the ""heinous and callous nature of the crimes"" committed by the defendant during his September 2020 crime spree.
""You creeped up on them,"" the judge told the defendant about the Sept. 12, 2020, attack on Deputies Claudia Apolinar and Emmanuel Perez-Perez outside a Compton transit center. ""It's all caught on video ... Luckily they both survived.""
Apolinar — who said she missed two years of work as a result of her injuries — told the judge that ""a coward woke up that day with the intention of murdering deputies.""
""Evil found us that day ... We were pushed to our limits,"" she said, calling Murray's surprise attack a ""cowardly act.""
""He failed and we survived,"" she said. ""My life will never be the same.""
Perez-Perez told the judge that it has been ""a long three years recovering"" and said the ""mental injuries are going to last forever."" He said he sees the scar on his forehead that serves as a ""reminder of almost dying,"" adding that he is happy that justice is being served.
Murray, 39, was convicted Sept. 28 of two counts of attempted murder of a peace officer, along with one count each of attempted murder, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, carjacking and robbery, along with four counts of possession of a firearm by a felon.
Sheriff Robert Luna sat in the Compton courtroom in support of the two wounded deputies during the sentencing.
""I came as a sign of support representing not only the men and women of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, but I believe our community, to personally thank these deputies not only for their service, but everything they've gone through and the family members that were here,"" the sheriff told reporters outside the courthouse. ""Thank God these two deputies survived.""
He said he was ""very satisfied"" with the judge's decision to impose the maximum term on Murray for what he called his ""violent behavior.""
""But to say I'm happy, I can't see anybody being happy. What a tragedy,"" the sheriff said.
""I have two deputies who I consider heroes that will be impacted not only physically but mentally for the rest of their life. They were shaken up today because this brought back that horrific night for them ... These two deputies were sitting in their car, radio car, in uniform, protecting our community and this individual decided that this was the night he was going to try and kill two deputies ... It was a straight-up ambush.""
The judge rejected the defense's request to strike Murray's 2015 conviction for criminal threats, while acknowledging that a packet of information about the defendant's childhood is ""heartbreaking"" and explains the hardship and dysfunction that he faced.
""Our system has failed him many times,"" defense attorney Kate Hardie said of her client.
Deputy District Attorney Stephen Lonseth called Murray's crimes ""atrocious,"" saying that they caused ""tremendous damage"" and that he ""deserves the maximum sentence.""
During Murray's trial, the prosecutor told jurors that Murray shot four people and tried to kill three of them, including the two sheriff's deputies whom he allegedly tried to ambush in what the prosecutor said was ""no impulse.""
Murray allegedly said after the shooting that he couldn't believe the deputies hadn't died, the deputy district attorney said.
The prosecutor told the panel that Murray ""did everything he could to end the lives of Claudia Apolinar and Emmanuel Perez-Perez,"" saying ""this wasn't some impulsive thing.""
""They're alive because of, frankly, a miracle,"" Lonseth said, citing the ""heroic actions"" of Apolinar in trying to aid her partner despite being wounded herself in the jaw and arms.
The prosecutor had told jurors during his opening statement in August that Murray ""lost it"" and ""sought to take out revenge"" after sheriff's deputies shot and killed his best friend, Sam Herrera, while serving a search warrant in Compton on Sept. 10, 2020, two days before Apolinar and Perez-Perez were ambushed.
Murray allegedly ""unloaded over and over again"" by firing upon a man he mistakenly believed was a detective in an unmarked car near the Compton courthouse on Sept. 10, 2020, then driving away in a black Mercedes-Benz that had been carjacked nine days earlier from a man who was shot in the leg with a rifle, Lonseth told the panel.
The defendant -- who allegedly abandoned the Mercedes-Benz near an elementary school -- was arrested Sept. 15, 2020, after leading police on a chase in which he tossed a ""ghost gun"" from the Toyota Solara he was driving and then running into a neighborhood, where he was subsequently found hiding under a chicken coop in a resident's backyard, the prosecutor said.
Ballistics testing subsequently determined that the .40-caliber weapon had been used to shoot the sheriff's deputies, authorities said.
Murray's attorney told jurors her client was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and grief-stricken over his best friend's shooting death by other sheriff's deputies two days earlier.
The defense lawyer told jurors the ""closest person"" to Murray had been killed, calling the days between Sept. 10 and Sept. 12 of that year ""the worst time in Mr. Murray's life.""
Hardie told jurors her client's actions were ""impulsive"" and fueled by alcohol, methamphetamine and grief over his best friend's death.
She told the panel they had heard about evidence of Murray's intoxication from six separate sources, saying that and his mental state negate both premeditation and intent to kill involving the attempted murder charges.
Hardie accused the prosecutor of trying to sway the jurors' emotions by arguing that it would have been a murder case if it wasn't for Apolinar's actions.
""You can, in your outside lives, think these deputies are heroes ...,"" Murray's attorney said, while urging jurors to consider only the evidence and jury instructions during the trial.
The defense lawyer conceded an assault charge involving the first shooting on Sept. 1, 2020, along with a series of counts against Murray alleging that he was a felon in possession of a firearm. She described her client as having been convicted of ""small stuff.""
But she told jurors the defense was contesting other charges against him, including the attempted murder counts involving the deputies and the carjacking and robbery counts involving the first shooting victim named in the assault count.
The defense lawyer told jurors the defense was ""not asking you ... to let him go,"" but was asking them to ""follow the law.""
During the trial, jurors heard from the two wounded deputies along with Murray, who testified in his own defense.
Wearing a sheriff's uniform while on the stand, Apolinar told jurors that she heard gunshots and that her vision went blank for a few seconds after she and her partner were shot.
She testified that she didn't immediately know where she had been shot but felt a ""warm sensation in my mouth"" and tried to speak over a police radio to report what had happened to her and her partner.
She told jurors that she felt her tongue flapping around in her mouth and that the dispatcher was having difficulty understanding her plea for assistance.
""I knew I was hit in the mouth,"" Apolinar, the mother of a then 6-year-old child, told jurors.
She said she subsequently tried to help her partner, who was struggling to put a tourniquet on after she saw his face and right arm covered in blood.
""I didn't know where the suspect was at, if he was going to come back,"" the deputy told jurors, saying later she did not see who he was and that neither she nor her partner fired any shots in response.
Surveillance video shows the gunman walking up to the passenger side of the sheriff's vehicle, firing and then quickly leaving, and Apolinar subsequently coming to her partner's aid followed by the two -- both of their uniforms stained with blood -- hurrying to a waiting patrol vehicle that rushed them to a hospital.
She said she later learned that one round struck her in the jaw and ""nearly cut my tongue off"" and that she also suffered gunshot wounds to both of her arms, which were broken in the shooting. The deputy said she still has scars on both of her arms and her face from the attack, and that she returned to work at the sheriff's department last September.
Apolinar was praised for helping her wounded partner despite her own injuries, with then-District Attorney Jackie Lacey calling her actions ""heroic."" The deputy was subsequently honored with the 2021 American Legion, Department of California's Law Enforcement Officer of the Year for Valor award.
Apolinar's partner was shot in the forehead and an arm.

LAUDERHILLE, Fla. -- The Lauderdale Police Department said Wednesday that its investigators were searching for a suspect and a motive in connection with a triple shooting the day before that left a woman dead and a young girl and man injured.
Trecia Spencer Carruthers, 35, died at the scene while the two other victims, who were not immediately identified, were rushed for treatment to Broward Health Medical Center, police said in a written statement. They were later released after being treated for injuries believed to be non-life threatening.
Police were called to the 5600 block of NW 28th Street shortly before 4:30 p.m. after receiving a report of gunfire.
When the officers arrived, they found the three victims all suffering from several gunshot wounds.
Police said the motive for the shooting is unknown and they had not identified a suspect as of Wednesday afternoon.
One area resident said he was in his apartment when he heard multiple gunshots.
""Around 15-20 and they were loud, extremely loud,"" the man said. ""It sounded like handguns and machine guns.""
Several police officers converged on the scene and erected yellow crime scene tape as investigators hunted for clues at the scene.
Anyone with information was asked to call the Lauderhill Police Department at 954-497-4700.

"Jason Aldean says he stands by controversial ""Try That in a Small Town"": ""I know what the intentions were""",2023-11-01,2023-11-02T05:45:35Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-try-that-in-a-small-town-song-video-i-know-what-the-intentions-were/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102054535id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-try-that-in-a-small-town-song-video-i-know-what-the-intentions-were/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102054535/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-try-that-in-a-small-town-song-video-i-know-what-the-intentions-were/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL25ld3MvamFzb24tYWxkZWFuLXN0YW5kcy1ieS1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLXRyeS10aGF0LWluLWEtc21hbGwtdG93bi1zb25nLXZpZGVvLWkta25vdy13aGF0LXRoZS1pbnRlbnRpb25zLXdlcmU~,"Jason Aldean says he stands by controversial ""Try That in a Small Town"": ""I know what the intentions were""
Country music superstar Jason Aldean found himself facing an unexpected wave of controversy when his song, ""Try That in a Small Town,"" gained widespread attention in July following the release of its music video, which depicts protesters confronting police officers.
Supporters believe the song champions the values of small towns during uncertain times, while critics argue it contains racist undertones and calls for violence.
In Aldean's first network news interview about the controversy, he defended the song and the music video's content.
""There was people of all color doing stuff in the video. That's what I don't understand,"" he told CBS News. ""There was White people in there. There was Black people. I mean, this video did not shine light on one specific group and say, 'That's the problem.' And anybody that saw that in the video, then you weren't looking hard enough in the video, is all I can tell you.""
Adding to the controversy was the location of the video shoot: in front of the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, the site of a 1927 lynching of a Black teenager. Aldean, who is a resident of the county, said he didn't know a lynching had taken place there.
""But I also don't go back a hundred years and check on the history of a place before we go shoot it either,"" he said. ""It's also the place that I go get my car tags every year. It's my county that I live in.""
His team pointed out that other productions have filmed outside the courthouse without issue. Aldean also said that in the South, it would probably be hard to find a small-town courthouse ""that hasn't had some sort of racial issue over the years at some point.""
""I don't feel bad about that because I know my intentions behind, you know, shooting the video there and recording the song and everything,"" he said.
But Aldean said that knowing what he knows now, he probably wouldn't shoot the video at the courthouse if he were to do it over.
""I would do it over again, every time ... minus the setting, knowing what I know now, obviously, you know, knowing that that was gonna be a thing, you know, maybe you look at doing it somewhere else,"" he said.
Still, he said, ""I know what the intentions were behind the location, the video, the song, all of it. And, you know, and I stand by all that.""
The ""Try That in a Small Town"" video, according to Aldean, aimed to highlight the ""lawlessness"" and ""disrespect for cops"" seen in some places, inspired by Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire."" He added that his personal experiences, like the 2017 Route 91 festival shooting in Las Vegas while he was performing, impact his perspectives.
""My pregnant wife was there. Our fans were there watching the show,"" he said. ""All hell breaks loose and you're not prepared, you know, it's like, 'I got a guitar, what am I gonna do?'""
""I do think it makes you look at things a little different when you go through something like that,"" he added.
Prior to the song's release in May, Aldean thought a different aspect of it would generate the most discussion.
""I thought was gonna be the biggest issue with the song was that it said gun,"" Aldean said, referring to the lyrics, ""Got a gun that my grandad gave me. They say one day they're gonna round up.""
""So, I didn't expect it to get the kind of heat that it got,"" he said. ""And I think that was more probably because of the video, more so than the actual song.""
Amid the backlash, a Black Lives Matter protest was removed from the music video, drawing even more criticism. His team said the clips were used without permission and therefore had to be taken out.
Aldean's new album, ""Highway Desperado,"" is set to be released on Nov. 3, and it includes ""Try That in a Small Town.""

NEW YORK -- A three-day manhunt in Brooklyn ended Wednesday morning with police fatally shooting a man they say shot and killed his neighbor and stepson on Sunday.
Officials said the suspect, Jason Pass, was hiding inside a vehicle in Bath Beach. Police were still awaiting a search warrant on the vehicle to see if the weapon allegedly used to kill the two people is still inside.
Police said the gun was not registered to Pass.
Watch: NYPD shares update on shooting investigation
Evidence cones were scattered throughout the corner of Bay 44th Street and Harway Avenue, with numerous police officers investigating. The scene was much calmer late Wednesday morning than it was earlier, when police say a wild encounter with the suspect ended deadly.
""They established dialogue, spoke for a few minutes, and that man lunged at one of the officers, causing the officers to fire for their own safety. A number of officers discharged their weapon,"" NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said.
""My best friend let me know there are cops on the corner. They're all dressed up and have guns out and then all of a sudden, within five minutes, you heard multiple gun shots. Boom, boom,"" neighbor Rebecca Maristany said.
READ MORE: NYPD: Jason Pass sought in fatal shooting of father and son in Brooklyn apartment complex
Police said the person they shot was 47-year-old Pass, a Brooklyn man who was on the run after allegedly shooting his two upstairs neighbors dead on Sunday.
NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said while a hostage negotiation team was on its way, officers on scene tried to talk to Pass for 15 minutes before they were forced to shot him three times in the chest and once in the leg.
""He basically was saying, what was happening today was not going to end well,"" Chell said.
Police said they used a license plate reader to find out where Pass was, locating him in his black Honda CRV.
""Captured the plate on a black car, indicting that the car and the occupant of the car were wanted for a double, horrific homicide,"" Chell said. ""As they exited their police car, they walked up to the car. The male jumped out of the car with a knife in his hand and took off running.""
Police allege Pass killed his upstairs neighbor, 47-year-old Bladimy Mathurin, and his 27-year-old stepson, Chinwai Mode, after having ongoing noise disputes. The shootings happened five miles away from Wednesday's scene, inside their East Flatbush apartment building, so Bath Beach residents were shocked it escalated into their neighborhood.
""To know this took place right at the corner of my house in a time children were going to school, makes us feel uneasy,"" Maristany said.
It is still unclear why Pass was hiding out in that section of Brooklyn, if he knew someone in the area, or if he was hiding in his car the whole time. Police are still looking into all of that.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- After more than a year without answers, the family of a man shot and killed in a Pittsburgh neighborhood is begging anyone who knows anything about his death to come forward.
Pittsburgh police said 39-year-old Dennis Winger was found inside a vehicle at the intersection of Vine Street and Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh's Crawford-Roberts neighborhood on July 14, 2022.
Police said a passerby called 911 just after midnight after they saw Winger in the driver's seat of a vehicle, believing he had overdosed. The passerby administered Narcan with no success.
When police officers and EMS arrived, they found that Winger had been shot in the side of his body. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
At the time of the shooting, police said there were no suspects. Now more than a year later, his death is still unsolved. Police said Dennis Winger's family is asking anyone who saw or heard anything that night to come forward.
""Denny was a father and family man and he loved his three girls. He was a prankster and a joker, but he would also literally give anyone the shirt off his back if they were in need. He was a person and he had value,"" his mother Debbie said in a post on the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police's Facebook page.
Anyone with information is asked to call violent crime unit detectives at 412-323-7800 and ask to talk to homicide.

"Jason Aldean says he stands by controversial ""Try That in a Small Town"": ""I know what the intentions were""",2023-11-01,2023-11-02T04:48:22Z,en,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-try-that-in-a-small-town-song-video-i-know-what-the-intentions-were/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102044822id_/https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-try-that-in-a-small-town-song-video-i-know-what-the-intentions-were/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102044822/https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-try-that-in-a-small-town-song-video-i-know-what-the-intentions-were/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNic25ld3MpL3RleGFzL25ld3MvamFzb24tYWxkZWFuLXN0YW5kcy1ieS1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLXRyeS10aGF0LWluLWEtc21hbGwtdG93bi1zb25nLXZpZGVvLWkta25vdy13aGF0LXRoZS1pbnRlbnRpb25zLXdlcmU~,"Jason Aldean says he stands by controversial ""Try That in a Small Town"": ""I know what the intentions were""
Country music superstar Jason Aldean found himself facing an unexpected wave of controversy when his song, ""Try That in a Small Town,"" gained widespread attention in July following the release of its music video, which depicts protesters confronting police officers.
Supporters believe the song champions the values of small towns during uncertain times, while critics argue it contains racist undertones and calls for violence.
In Aldean's first network news interview about the controversy, he defended the song and the music video's content.
""There was people of all color doing stuff in the video. That's what I don't understand,"" he told CBS News. ""There was White people in there. There was Black people. I mean, this video did not shine light on one specific group and say, 'That's the problem.' And anybody that saw that in the video, then you weren't looking hard enough in the video, is all I can tell you.""
Adding to the controversy was the location of the video shoot: in front of the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, the site of a 1927 lynching of a Black teenager. Aldean, who is a resident of the county, said he didn't know a lynching had taken place there.
""But I also don't go back a hundred years and check on the history of a place before we go shoot it either,"" he said. ""It's also the place that I go get my car tags every year. It's my county that I live in.""
His team pointed out that other productions have filmed outside the courthouse without issue. Aldean also said that in the South, it would probably be hard to find a small-town courthouse ""that hasn't had some sort of racial issue over the years at some point.""
""I don't feel bad about that because I know my intentions behind, you know, shooting the video there and recording the song and everything,"" he said.
But Aldean said that knowing what he knows now, he probably wouldn't shoot the video at the courthouse if he were to do it over.
""I would do it over again, every time ... minus the setting, knowing what I know now, obviously, you know, knowing that that was gonna be a thing, you know, maybe you look at doing it somewhere else,"" he said.
Still, he said, ""I know what the intentions were behind the location, the video, the song, all of it. And, you know, and I stand by all that.""
The ""Try That in a Small Town"" video, according to Aldean, aimed to highlight the ""lawlessness"" and ""disrespect for cops"" seen in some places, inspired by Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire."" He added that his personal experiences, like the 2017 Route 91 festival shooting in Las Vegas while he was performing, impact his perspectives.
""My pregnant wife was there. Our fans were there watching the show,"" he said. ""All hell breaks loose and you're not prepared, you know, it's like, 'I got a guitar, what am I gonna do?'""
""I do think it makes you look at things a little different when you go through something like that,"" he added.
Prior to the song's release in May, Aldean thought a different aspect of it would generate the most discussion.
""I thought was gonna be the biggest issue with the song was that it said gun,"" Aldean said, referring to the lyrics, ""Got a gun that my grandad gave me. They say one day they're gonna round up.""
""So, I didn't expect it to get the kind of heat that it got,"" he said. ""And I think that was more probably because of the video, more so than the actual song.""
Amid the backlash, a Black Lives Matter protest was removed from the music video, drawing even more criticism. His team said the clips were used without permission and therefore had to be taken out.
Aldean's new album, ""Highway Desperado,"" is set to be released on Nov. 3, and it includes ""Try That in a Small Town.""

"GREG GUTFELD: From the Methadone Mile to daytime camping, Democrats finally feel the heat on homelessness",2023-11-01,2023-11-02T06:07:00Z,en,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-methadone-mile-daytime-camping-democrat-homelessness,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102060700id_/https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-methadone-mile-daytime-camping-democrat-homelessness,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102060700/https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-methadone-mile-daytime-camping-democrat-homelessness,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGZveG5ld3MpL29waW5pb24vZ3JlZy1ndXRmZWxkLW1ldGhhZG9uZS1taWxlLWRheXRpbWUtY2FtcGluZy1kZW1vY3JhdC1ob21lbGVzc25lc3M~,"Finally, finally the attention I deserve. Happy Wednesday, everyone. So mental illness really is a problem in this country. Of course, history shows that the mentally ill have always been with us. But now our mostly Democrat run cities are awash in serious mental cases roaming the streets. It's sad. Several decades ago, this country decided that institutionalizing our mentally ill was somehow a violation of their rights. It's a pretty unique take on the Constitution, that it's every citizen's right to eat from garbage cans and treat our sidewalks like toilets. I don't remember James Madison actually adding that.
What we should've realized by now is that allowing those who can't care for themselves to attempt to care for themselves isn't respecting their rights. It's condemning them to hunger, disease and a lonely death on a frozen sidewalk, much like the future of any CNN anchor, but any caring society should do what it can to help those who can't help themselves.
LEGAL BATTLE UNDERWAY IN MA OVER HOMELESS SHELTER CAPACITIES
Now, to be clear, when I say mentally ill, I'm talking about those who are truly broken, the ones who live on the streets in an alternate reality, who scream at demons who aren't there and who hear voices and who all too often listen to the voices that tell them to hurt someone. Those voices never tell raving psychos to do anything positive, like, say, retire. So considering how much damage to themselves and society the mentally ill do, why isn't more being done to actually help? Well, as the old saying goes, follow the money.
Today, in our city and state governments, the homeless industrial complex has become a power silo just like any other. In NYC, every day feels more menacing and predictable than Dana Perino before her midday nap. And yet the Department of Homeless Services employs 2,000 people and has an annual budget that has grown to over $2 billion. And take a guess who controls all those jobs, all that money, it's almost always Dems.
Apparently, insanity is voting for the same party over and over and expecting different results. So every time a disturbed homeless guy pushes a woman in front of a subway car, homeless service executives, they don't hear the screams, they hear cash registers. The homicidal maniacs are putting their kids through college. More empathy, they demand, more personnel, more cars, more pensions, but somehow never more tough love, never anything that actually works, because then the problem would be solved, and a solved problem means no more money.
It's a swamp of a different sort, one that we're all stuck in, especially if you live in a Dem run crappy city. So it sounds like we need someone to drain that swamp and who might volunteer. You know, I wonder when he's back in the White House will he use every tool, lever and authority to get the homeless off our streets.
PROMINENT CRITIC OF BLUE STATE HOMELESS POLICIES ARRESTED ON THEFT CHARGES IN OREGON
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When I'm back in the White House, we will use every tool, lever and authority to get the homeless off our streets... And for those who are severely mentally ill and deeply disturbed, we will bring them back to mental institutions where they belong, with the goal of reintegrating them back into society once they are well enough to manage.
Sort of seems like common sense, doesn't it? And you want proof of that? Well, the ACLU opposes it. Now, there's nothing a progressive likes more than a new grievance group. Adding mentally ill homeless to the roster of the oppressed is yet another big cha-ching for them. Soon they'll hear voices telling them to vote for Joe Biden. But there is a limit to how much money even Washington can churn out. The printing presses are starting to melt down.
And so finally, even some Dem cities are feeling the heat. In Boston, the Democrat mayor signed legislation that takes effect today allowing cops to dismantle a homeless encampment known as the Methadone Mile. Trust me, no matter what the Century 21 agent tells you, don't buy in a neighborhood with that name.
Also, starting this month, police in Portland will be able to enforce a ban on what officials there are calling daytime camping, daytime camping. It's the perfect liberal euphemism. You know, like shooting heroin between your toes is something you learned in the Boy Scouts.
And after residents and store owners in Phenix brought a lawsuit, a federal judge is forcing that city to clean out a downtown homeless camp known as The Zone. So what's going on here?
BLUE CITY'S 'METHADONE MILE' TO BE DISMANTLED AFTER PROGRESSIVE MAYOR MAKES ORDER
Well, maybe some Democrats know they're in trouble and are going a bit Trumpy as we approach an election year. But as someone great once said, never confuse movement with action. I think it was my gastroenterologist, because as these officials move the homeless around, none of them will use Trump's key phrase: ""We will bring the severely disturbed to mental institutions."" That's right. It's that thing every parlor revolutionary dreads, force, which is necessary, or it won't work. Crazy people rarely agree that they're crazy.
Now, studies throughout history have shown that humans find green surroundings in a quiet countryside soothing, but what could be better for the mentally ill, for whom every honking horn can be a torture? Forcibly bringing the truly disturbed to countryside facilities where they could be given two hots and a cot and treated humanely and with even the possibility of release at some point. That's not treading on their rights, it's salvaging their most basic right to live with dignity and not die alone in degradation among maddening crowds and diesel belching buses.
And it'll ultimately be cheaper than the endless catch and release programs that we have now. But like so many other good ideas, it has two key fatal flaws. It makes perfect sense, and there's no money in it.
Because if they fixed homelessness, those bureaucrats would be the ones out in the street.

Sheriff’s deputy blasts Maine State Police as ‘utter clowns’ for ‘radio silence’ in search for mass shooter Robert Card,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T05:44:11Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/maine-state-police-utter-clowns-for-mass-shooter-hunt-veteran-deputy/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102054411id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/maine-state-police-utter-clowns-for-mass-shooter-hunt-veteran-deputy/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102054411/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/maine-state-police-utter-clowns-for-mass-shooter-hunt-veteran-deputy/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMS9uZXdzL21haW5lLXN0YXRlLXBvbGljZS11dHRlci1jbG93bnMtZm9yLW1hc3Mtc2hvb3Rlci1odW50LXZldGVyYW4tZGVwdXR5,"A veteran Maine cop who was one of the first to respond to the state’s deadliest mass shooting blasted state police as “utter clowns” for keeping local officers in the dark during the frantic hunt for the gunman who had just killed 18 people.
In a blistering, since-deleted Facebook post, Sgt. Jon Guay of the Androscoggin County Sheriff’s Office said state police shut out local cops even as huge areas were in lockdown before disturbed gunman Robert Card, 40, was found dead.
“‘Radio silence’ is the best phrase to describe the amount of information the Maine State Police shared with the hundreds of law enforcement officers who responded to assist with this manhunt,” he wrote, according to a screenshot shared by the Bangor Daily News.
“The upper echelons of the Maine State Police Major Crimes Unit and Command Staff are utter clowns and I wouldn’t hire them to manage the morning rush at Dunkin Donuts much less an investigation of this size.”
Even federal agencies were “left idle” during the 48-hour manhunt, with the only info from state cops coming unofficially through “leaks,” claimed Guay, an officer of 24 years.
“I say this not as sour grapes but because it was expressed to me from every single law enforcement officer I spoke with,” he wrote.
“To not include our local agencies in the information circle is insulting and one we will never forget.”
Card gunned down 18 people and injured 13 others at a bar and bowling alley in Lewiston last Wednesday night, sparking a terrifying lockdown in the region, with schools all closed.
His body was not found until Friday in a trailer at a recycling center in Lisbon Falls. He died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, but it was unclear when.
A day after the shooting, 350 law enforcement officers from the state, county and local levels from across Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont were assisting in the search. Federal agents including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the US Marshals Service, and the Department of Homeland Security also took part in the hunt.
“Nothing is more defeating to a cop than seeing carnage from the dead and injured knowing that you can’t change that, but then being kept out of the loop as to whereabouts of the person responsible,” Guay wrote.
The veteran officer also noted that his colleagues have developed networks and relationships that could have allowed information to spread within “seconds.”
“No one knows this county better than the local officers who work in it,” Guay wrote. “We have utilized this networking strategy many times before in separate incidents, but when Maine State Police showed up Wednesday night … all that stopped.”
It’s unclear when Guay made the post, though it did not violate office policies, Androscoggin County Sheriff Eric Samson said, adding that he understood Guay’s frustrations.
“You look at that tragedy, and you look at what we have all been through — everybody involved,” Samson said. “But he was expressing his frustration, and I get it.”
The Maine State Police have not provided details on how the manhunt was led, who was in charge, and how each agency involved was led.

That was a little over five weeks before Oct. 25, when Card killed 18 and injured 13 more in the deadliest mass shooting in Maine's history.
The text was among the trove of documents released by the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office this week, including letters from Card's friends and colleagues expressing concern for his rapidly deteriorating mental state.
""Change the passcode to the unit gate and be armed if sfc Card does arrive. Please,"" the sender – identified as ""Ssg Hodgson"" – said in the Sept. 15 text exchange to Cpl. Kelvin Mote, who is an Ellsworth police officer. ""I believe he’s messed up in the head. (sic) And threaten the unit … and other places.""

Cpl. Mote included the texts in an email to the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office, which described Card's erratic and confrontational behavior, which appeared to stem from paranoia.

""Card has been hearing voices calling him a pedophile, saying he has a small d--- and other insults,"" Cpl. Mote wrote in an email obtained by Fox News Digital (and included in full below).
Card started hearing voices in the spring, Cpl. Mote wrote, and it ""has only gotten worse,"" which led to physical confrontations with colleagues and even ""a longtime friend.""
On July 15, while at West Point, he accused other soldiers of calling him a pedophile ""and said he would take care of it,"" Cpl. Mote wrote. ""Card got in his (longtime friend) face, shoved him and told him to stop calling him a pedophile.""
The tense exchange temporarily deescalated, but Card continued to repeat ""he would take care of it"" during the car ride home, according to Cpl. Mote.

""Once they got back to the motel, Card locked himself in his room and would not answer the door when they tried to make contact,"" he wrote.
The next morning, Cpl. Mote and other soldiers tried to convince Card to see a psychologist, which sparked another tense exchange, according to the email.
Card was ultimately taken to Four Winds Psychiatric Hospital in Katonah, New York, for treatment and evaluation, but he ""never spoke, just stared through me without blinking,"" wrote Cpl. Mote.
Cpl. Mote noted Card spent 14 days in the hospital, left and didn't seek out any other treatment.

He detailed other incidents where Card again mentioned he was being called a pedophile and that he was going to get ""them.""
That phrase ""get them"" was in quotes throughout Cpl. Mote's email: ""Since the commander and I are the one who had him committed, we are the ‘them.’""
""He also said I was the reason he can't buy guns anymore because of the commitment,"" Cpl. Mote wrote.
There were well-being checks on Card at his home at 941 Meadow Road in Bowdoin, Maine, where Fox News Digital detailed an all-night law enforcement raid and execution of search warrants on Thursday night.
""I would rather err on the side of caution with regards to Card since he is a capable marksman, and if he set his mind to carry out threats made to Hodgson, he would be able to do it,"" Cpl. Mote wrote.
Two mass shootings in minutes
Card killed 18 people and injured 13 more on Oct. 25 during his deadly rampage at the Schemengees Bar and Grille and Just In Time bowling alley, previously known as Sparetime Recreation, in Lewiston.
He seemingly vanished into the chaos, which sent Lewiston and the surrounding areas into a COVID-like shutdown during a two-day-long manhunt until Card was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a trailer of a recycling facility.
MAINE MASS SHOOTING SUSPECT'S FAMILY ‘VERY COOPERATIVE’ IN MANHUNT THAT DISCOVERED HIS BODY: POLICE
Again, he believed people in both locations were calling him a pedophile, according to witnesses, including Card's brother and son.
Card knew people at both locations, which are well-known hangout spots in the area.
After two days, Card was found dead in a trailer in the overflow lot of a recycling facility in Lisbon, which is along a walking trail where law enforcement found his abandoned car.
The lot where Card was found is separated from the main facility by a street and is northwest and out of the way from the main building, so police didn't search the trailers after they cleared the facility twice before.
Card was wearing the same sweatshirt as the night of the shooting, according to law enforcement, which found him with two other guns.

Using the video and transcript of Chrystul Kizer's 2018 interview with Kenosha police investigators as trial evidence would likely violate the Milwaukee woman's constitutional rights, Kenosha Circuit Court Judge David Wilk ruled, the Kenosha News reported.
The judge granted a request by Kizer's attorneys to suppress the information. In his ruling, Wilk said the court would be ""hard pressed"" to find that Kizer’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment right to have an attorney present during questioning would be violated if the video and transcript were used.

FLORIDA STING TARGETING CHILD SEX EXPLOITATION FINDS NEARLY 40% OF ARRESTEES IN US ILLEGALLY
Kizer faces multiple charges, including arson and first-degree intentional homicide in the June 2018 fatal shooting of Randall Volar. Her trial has not been scheduled.
Kizer's interview with police occurred inside a room in Kenosha's Public Safety Building while she was in custody and had already retained legal representation. Her lawyer was not present for the interview.
One of her attorneys, Helmi Hamad, called the police interview a ""horrible thing that occurred."" He said Wilk’s ruling ""is a step towards making sure Chrystul gets a fair trial and gets her life back.""
Prosecutors declined to comment after Tuesday’s hearing.
They had argued that the October 2018 video and transcripts could be used at trial because they believe Kizer initiated contact with detectives. They also said she was not under undue influence of law enforcement after writing them a note stating that she would like to speak with them about a homicide case.
Kizer spoke with detectives at length without her legal counsel and was not read her Miranda warnings.
Prosecutors allege that Kizer shot Volar, 34, at his Kenosha home when she was 17, which is old enough to be considered an adult in Wisconsin’s criminal justice system.
Kizer, now 23, contends Volar was trafficking her for sex. She has said that she met Volar on a sex-trafficking website and that he sexually assaulted her and sold her to others for sex.

The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are sexual assault victims, but Kizer discussed her case in an interview from jail with The Washington Post that was published in 2019.
According to court documents, Kizer put a gun in her bookbag in June 2018 and told her boyfriend that she was going to shoot Volar because she was tired of him touching her.
She traveled from Milwaukee to Volar’s Kenosha home, shot him in the head, burned down his house and stole his BMW, according to court documents.
Last year, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that Kizer can argue at trial that she was justified in the killing — a ruling that could help define the limits of legal immunity for trafficking victims nationwide.",N

County deputies in Compton
A man who said he shot two sheriffâs deputies at point-blank range while seeking revenge for a friend killed by police was sentenced to 166 years in prison Wednesday, prosecutors said.
Deonte Murray, 39, was convicted in September on multiple counts of attempted murder, assault, robbery and carjacking for an 11-day string of crimes that culminated when he walked up to an L.A. County Sheriffâs Department cruiser parked outside a Compton train station and opened fire. Deputies Claudia Apolinar and Emmanuel Perez-Perez were struck in the head and face and required surgery for their serious injuries.
The attack occurred in September 2020, on the heels of the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and during a flash point in police-community relations in L.A. after weeks of local protests against law enforcement. Murray, who admitted to the shootings, said he wanted payback after deputies killed his best friend, Samuel Herrera.
Eleven days before the attack on Apolinar and Perez-Perez, Herrera died in a shootout with sheriffâs deputies who were trying to serve a search warrant. Police recovered a small cache of firearms in Herreraâs garage, and neither of the deputies that Murray shot were involved in Herreraâs killing.
By the time he sidled up to a patrol car and shot two Los Angeles County Sheriffâs deputies at point-blank range, Deonte Lee Murray was in the midst of a crime rampage.
Murrayâs attorney, Kate Hardie, said her client was in a grief-stricken rage after Herreraâs death and acting irrationally. He was living out of his car and operating in âa blurâ of cognac and methamphetamine, she said.
Before shooting the deputies, Murray sprayed bullets at a car outside the Compton courthouse at a man he assumed was a plainclothes police detective. The victim in that shooting was not a law enforcement officer; heâd simply gone to the courthouse to file paperwork and was âtrying to do a Zoom meeting in his car,â Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Lonseth told jurors.
Hours later, Murray approached the deputiesâ cruiser and shot through the front passengerâs window before running away. Surveillance footage from the scene showed Apolinar, stained with blood, tending to Perez-Perezâs wounds.
âTheyâre alive because of, frankly, a miracle, and the heroics of Claudia Apolinar, who, despite being shot through the jaw, through the wrist, kept this from being a murder case,â Lonseth said.

Questions swirl in wake of massacre
A history of mental illness. An array of weapons. Law enforcement knew about his potential for violence. But he was still able to own guns and commit the deadliest mass shooting in Maineâs history.
One week later, many in Lewiston and nationwide are asking: Why did he have guns at all?
Robert Card was identified by authorities as a person of interest four hours after he shot and killed 18 people and wounded 13 others at a bowling alley and a bar in Maineâs second-largest city. But Card, who was found dead two days after his rampage, had been well known to law enforcement for months.
The intensifying scrutiny over Cardâs access to firearms underscores the difficulty in seizing guns from potentially dangerous people with mental illness â especially when numerous states and jurisdictions are involved, as was the case with Card.
The U.S. Army reservist spent time in a psychiatric facility in New York this summer and he reportedly blamed fellow military officials for his hospitalization, according to a letter an unidentified member of the unit wrote to a Maine sheriffâs deputy.
Itâs unclear when the letter was sent, but the writer describes getting a call from a friend of Cardâs who was concerned Card was âgoing to snap and commit a mass shooting.â The letter was included in the deputyâs Sept. 15 report about efforts to contact Card.
Maine mass shooting leaves 18 dead; shelter-in-place orders extended as manhunt expands
Authorities say 18 people were killed and 13 injured at two locations Wednesday night in Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine.
Card threatened to shoot up the Army reserve drill center in Saco, Maine, and other places, and said that he was going to get âthem.â
âSince the commander and I are the ones who had him committed we are the âthem,ââ wrote the unidentified letter writer. âHe also said I was the reason he canât buy guns anymore because of the commitment.â
Authorities at the state and federal level have not said that Cardâs history of mental illness should have triggered laws that kept him from owning guns. There was nothing on Cardâs record before the shooting that would have kept him from passing a federal background check to buy a gun, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a statement.
Involuntary commitments are reported to federal authorities differently from state to state, said Mark Collins, federal policy director at the gun-violence prevention group Brady.
Generally, though, not everyone who gets mental health treatment at a facility is considered involuntarily committed. Thatâs a determination legally made by a court or a board, which then communicates it to another state body tasked with sending that information to the federal background-check system maintained by the FBI.
Each state has an agency that should report it, but itâs not legally required everywhere, he said. Maine, for example, does require the State Bureau of Identification to report commitments to the FBI database.
At least four of the victims of a mass shooting in Maine were deaf, sending shock waves through the community.
âThis is the clearest cut case Iâve seen where an extreme-risk protection order could have saved all these lives,â Collins said, referring to measures often called âred-flagâ laws, which Maine does not have. âThis guy did everything short of taking out a front-page ad in the newspaper saying he was going to commit an atrocity.â
Concern about Cardâs behavior accelerated after an altercation he had with fellow Army Reserve members. Card and other members of the Army Reserveâs 3rd Battalion, 304th Infantry Unit were in New York for training on July 15 when he accused several of them of calling him a pedophile, shoved one of them and locked himself in his motel room. The next morning, he told another soldier that he wanted people to stop talking about him.
âI told him no one was talking about him and everyone here was his friend. Card told me to leave him alone and tried to slam the door in my face,â the soldier later told Maine authorities, according to documents released by the sheriffâs office.
New York State Police responded and brought Card to a hospital at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point for an evaluation. Card spent 14 days at the Four Winds Psychiatric Hospital in Katonah, N.Y., which is a few miles from West Point.
Jonathan Crisp, an Army lawyer for two decades before starting a criminal defense practice, said when soldiers are committed involuntarily to mental health facilities by others in the chain of command, it is a âreportableâ event under Army regulations that triggers a requirement to alert others, including the FBI.
Maine mass shooter heard voices, may have embraced conspiracy theories, officials say
Police have not declared a motive in the mass shooting by Robert Card, whose body was discovered Friday.
âIf they took him and he didnât want to go and he refused to be admitted, itâs a slam dunk,â Crisp said. âThis should have been reported.â
Questions over military protocols that should have been enacted with Card are similar to those raised in 2017 mass shooting during Sunday services at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. More than two dozen people â including eight children â were shot and killed by a gunman who had served in the Air Force before the attack and had once escaped a mental health center.
After Card left the psychiatric facility in early August, the Army directed that while on duty, he shouldnât be allowed to have a weapon, handle ammunition or participate in live-fire activity. It also declared him to be non-deployable.
Military experts say that even if Cardâs commanders determined he shouldnât be around weapons after being committed, they would have had only a handful of options to implement, such as prohibiting him from handling weapons while on duty or attempting to sever him from the Army Reserves. Thereâs little they can do when the citizen-soldiers are back in civilian life.
Several weeks after his release from the hospital, on Sept. 15, a deputy was sent to visit Cardâs home in Bowdoin, about 10 miles southeast of Lewiston, for a wellness check. A deputy went to Cardâs trailer but couldnât find him.
Maine mass shooterâs family reached out to sheriff 5 months before rampage, sheriffâs office says
Maineâs authorities are trying to piece together the events that led to the worst mass shooting in the stateâs history.
The sheriffâs office then sent out a statewide alert seeking help locating Card. It included a warning that he was known to be âarmed and dangerousâ and that officers should use extreme caution.
On Sept. 16, the same deputy and another one returned to Cardâs trailer. Cardâs car was there and the deputy said he could hear him moving around the trailer, but no one answered the door, according to the deputyâs report.
Deputies didnât have legal authority to press the case if Card didnât want to open the door, Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry said Wednesday .
On Oct. 18, the sheriffâs office canceled a statewide alert seeking help locating Card.
A week later, shortly before 7 p.m. on Oct. 25, authorities began receiving 911 calls about a gunman at the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley in Lewiston.

Halloween mass shooting as people gunned down during trick-or-treating,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T03:15:13Z,en,newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/halloween-mass-shooting-people-gunned-down-trick-treating-1839797,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102031513id_/https://www.newsweek.com/halloween-mass-shooting-people-gunned-down-trick-treating-1839797,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102031513/https://www.newsweek.com/halloween-mass-shooting-people-gunned-down-trick-treating-1839797,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG5ld3N3ZWVrKS9oYWxsb3dlZW4tbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy1wZW9wbGUtZ3VubmVkLWRvd24tdHJpY2stdHJlYXRpbmctMTgzOTc5Nw~~,"Three people were shot on Halloween night in Bear's Salem Woods community in Delaware, according to New Castle County police, as trick-or-treating was coming to an end.
New Castle County Police Department Spokesman Cpl. Mike McNasby said that the police were alerted about a shooting in the first block of Alvin Drive just before 8 p.m., as reported by Delaware Online.
Officers found two boys aged 16 and 17 and a 20-year-old woman with gun wounds who were taken to Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. While their conditions are not known, McNasby reportedly said that at least two of the three victims were critically injured. NBC 10 Philadelphia reported that two of them were on trauma codes.
Several roads were closed in the area following the incident, including Jaymar Boulevard, Emily Court, and Alvin Drive, and police stepped up their presence in the locality.
""The public can expect an increased police presence in the area for several hours,"" the New Castle County Police Department wrote. ""This is an active investigation and further information will be provided when it becomes available.""
The dynamics of the shooting are still unclear and are currently being investigated by the police. Officers are asking anyone with information to call the criminal investigations unit at 302-395-8110 or submit information anonymously through Delaware Crime Stoppers at 800-TIP-3333 or at delawarecrimestoppers.com.
Newsweek contacted the New Castle County police department for comment by email on Wednesday.
The shooting in Delaware wasn't the only one in the days leading to Halloween.
Another mass shooting took place at a Halloween party in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday when a 48-year-old convicted felon allegedly opened fire and shot 15 people. The gunman, identified as William Groves, was charged with 15 counts of attempted first-degree murder. As a convicted felon, he shouldn't have had a gun.
According to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, 11 people were shot dead and 76 others wounded in mass shootings across the country in the weekend before Halloween.

"Through Our Shared Grief, a New Israel Is Being Born—of All Its Citizens",2023-11-01,2023-11-02T04:27:31Z,en,newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/through-our-shared-grief-new-israeli-nation-being-born-all-its-citizens-opinion-1839540,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102042731id_/https://www.newsweek.com/through-our-shared-grief-new-israeli-nation-being-born-all-its-citizens-opinion-1839540,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102042731/https://www.newsweek.com/through-our-shared-grief-new-israeli-nation-being-born-all-its-citizens-opinion-1839540,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG5ld3N3ZWVrKS90aHJvdWdoLW91ci1zaGFyZWQtZ3JpZWYtbmV3LWlzcmFlbGktbmF0aW9uLWJlaW5nLWJvcm4tYWxsLWl0cy1jaXRpemVucy1vcGluaW9uLTE4Mzk1NDA~,"On the chilly morning of October 7, Israel was awakened by the sounds of sirens, explosions, and mass shootings. I was awakened by a phone call from a friend, herself a Hamas terror survivor.
""Wake up!"" She shouted over the phone. ""We are under attack.""
I checked my phone—it was around 7:40 am—where I found news notifications in three languages reporting barrages of missiles from Gaza. Thinking it was just another round of the usual rocket attacks, I went back to sleep. It wasn't until I woke up again half an hour later and started scrolling social media that the horror began to set in. Not long after, I received the news about a friend's sister who was killed defending our border, and another friend from university who has been missing ever since the attack. Their names are Eden Nemri and Idan Shtivi.
Hamas, the Iranian regime's Palestinian terror proxy which has been ruling the Gaza strip since 2007, murdered 1,500, injured 7,000, and violently kidnapped at least 239. But they didn't stop there. Hamas and its sponsor in Tehran had bigger plans. As in previous Israeli-Palestinian escalations, they attempted to bring the battlefield deep into Israel's home front, wishing to destabilize Israel from within by instigating ethnic violence in the country between Israeli Jews and Arabs.
Back in May 2021, these attempts were partially successful, with ethnic strife erupting across the nation. Not this time, no doubt to Tehran's dismay: Israelis have had enough! October 7 was a horrifying day, yet it accomplished what many of us thought was impossible: It united the whole country.
October 7 will be remembered not only as Israel's bloodiest day but as a turning point in modern collective Israeli history.
The horror from the scenes and the horrifying stories have not only shocked all Israelis, but also marked a drastic shift in Arab Israeli attitude toward the country, especially when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Historically during Israeli-Palestinian escalations, the Arab community within Israel tended to be more sympathetic to Palestinians, mainly due to our exposure to Palestinian suffering.
But on October 7, it was that same exposure that made us feel more Israeli than ever—when we saw not only the footage of our mass murder but the celebrations of it in Gaza that came through on social media. We saw clearly what would happen if the other side had the upper hand, and it triggered a deep sense of solidarity from the Arab community, bolstering a shared sense of being Israeli.
According to a large poll carried out after the Hamas attack, over 80 percent of Arab Israelis rejected Hamas's attack and almost 70 percent supported Israel's right to respond and defend its citizens. Only 5 percent of respondents voiced support for Hamas's actions.
Many social initiatives popped up with opportunities for Arab Israelis to assist and volunteer. Leaders from across the political spectrum in the Arab community condemned the attack and rejected Hamas's calls on Israel's Arab citizens to join the assault on Israel. Mansour Abbas, leader of the Raam Islamist Party, said it best when he condemned Hamas's atrocities and said they are ""contradictory to the teachings of Islam.""
This shift is not a coincidence. Hamas's indiscriminate massacre against Israeli civilians took the lives of at least 100 Israelis from the country's Arab community. It reminded us that in our messy regional geopolitical reality, to our enemies, we Israelis all one, so we might as well own it.
One of those Arab victims murdered by Hamas was Awad Darawshe, a paramedic from a Nazareth suburb who was stationed at the Nova music festival when the attack started. Many of his colleagues fled the scene for their lives, but Awad refused to do so. He insisted on staying put and helping the injured who were pouring into his station. His family members told Israeli media that Awad told them he would be safe because he speaks Arabic, not realizing that his Arabic would not save him from the barbarity of Iran's terror proxies. Awad was murdered while trying to save lives.
We also heard the story of Amer Abu Sabila, who was shot to death by Hamas terrorists while trying to save a local Sderot family. And we heard of a local Negev Bedouin man who was driving with his wife down the highway that Saturday morning, when a group of terrorists blocked his way. The Bedouin begged the terrorists not to hurt him and his wife, to which one of the terrorists responded, ""You [Arab Israelis] are more Jewish than Jews, you deserve to die."" The terrorist then shot the man's wife, a hijabi Muslim woman, to death. He survived to tell the tale.
Unfortunately, the fact that hundreds of us were murdered, injured and possibly raped and kidnapped, some while attempting to save Jews, doesn't help us escape our traditional role in Israel as scapegoats and punching bags, especially in right wing circles and for incompetent failed politicians. Our current Kahanist government which failed us unforgivably on October 7 has decided to take advantage of the war to fuel unrest in the West Bank, crack down on Israeli civil society and shared Arab-Jewish initiatives in addition to freedom of expression.
Sadly, it's nothing new. Since this government took office and especially since the outbreak of the war, it has turned us Arab Israelis—one out of every five Israeli citizens—into a fifth element, enemies from within. Anti-Arab minister of ""national security"" has warned of Arab riots, playing into the hands of our enemies while ignoring the overwhelming voiced support for the country, armed forces, and fellow citizens from the Arab community, ignoring as well advice from the heads of the police and other security service who've been applauding Israeli Arabs for their contribution for the war efforts, insisting there's no internal threat whatsoever from Arab Israelis that has the potential to jeopardize the stability on our home front.
This is nothing less than a historic shift. October 7 will be remembered not only as deadly bloody day, the deadliest in Israel's 75-year history, but also as the day the modern Israeli nation was reborn.
I can only hope that our shared collective grief and trauma will eventually lead us to pursue peace and reconciliation, both internally and externally, instead of more bloody cycles of violence and escalation.

Neighbor wanted for hallway killings of NYC dad and stepson is fatally shot by police,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T07:29:56Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/metro/cops-shoot-jason-pass-accused-of-killing-nyc-dad-and-stepson/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102072956id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/metro/cops-shoot-jason-pass-accused-of-killing-nyc-dad-and-stepson/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102072956/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/metro/cops-shoot-jason-pass-accused-of-killing-nyc-dad-and-stepson/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMS9tZXRyby9jb3BzLXNob290LWphc29uLXBhc3MtYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1raWxsaW5nLW55Yy1kYWQtYW5kLXN0ZXBzb24~,"The on-the-run suspect wanted in the execution-style killings of his two upstairs neighbors was shot dead by police early Wednesday when he charged at cops with a six-inch knife during a traffic stop in Brooklyn, NYPD officials said.
Jason Pass, 47, was in a car on Bay 44th Street in Bath Beach at around 7:10 a.m. when cops in a police cruiser equipped with a license plate reader got a hit on his vehicle and stopped him, authorities said.
Pass — who had been wanted since Sunday night after being caught on video fatally shooting 47-year-old school bus driver Bladimy Mathurin and his 27-year-old stepson, Chinwai Mode — “jumped out of the car with a knife in his hand and took off running,â NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell told reporters.
The officers were able to corner him and spoke with him for about 15 minutes — with Pass “basically saying what’s happening today is not going to end well,â Chell said.
Then, “for some unknown reason” Pass “did a full sprint [and] charged the officers,â Chell said.
âHe didnât give us a choice,â the chief added. â[Our officers] did everything he could to neutralize this person and get that knife out of his hand.â
Pass was rushed to NYU Langone Hospital in critical condition and later succumbed to his injuries after being hit four times, including three shots to the chest, Chell said.
âHe charged at them with a knife,â a police source told The Post, calling it attempted âsuicide.â
Neighbors told The Post they saw Pass booking it out of his car, with the officers hot on his trail.
“They were talking to him for a long time, for like 15 minutes, they were just trying to reason with him,” said one woman, who asked her name be withheld.Â “It looked like he was crying. He put his hands on his forehead a few times. And then they started yelling.
“They kept yelling, ‘drop the knife! drop the knife! drop the knife!’ … And then they shot him,” she recalled.
Another witness, a 50-year-old registered nurse who only provided her first name, Terry, also said Pass seemed “either confused or scared” when the cops cornered him.
“He was standing like this with his hand on his forehead,” she recalled. “The cops were trying to talk him down. I heard them say ‘drop the knife!’ They said it a few times. Then the shots.”
The former correction officer was identified by law enforcement yesterday as the suspect in the cold-blooded killings of Mathurin and Mode.
The ghastly double homicide occurred at Brooklynâs Flatbush Gardens apartment complex Sunday night and was caught on surveillance video.
The shooting â in the hallway of a well-known housing complex where stars Barbra Streisand and Michael K. Williams grew up â was sparked by an argument over noise.
The distressing footage obtained by The Post showed the shooter, dressed in dark clothing, angrily confronting his upstairs neighbors over noise before 10:30 p.m. Sunday. The video has no audio, so it is unknown what exactly was said during the exchange.
The feud escalated when Mathurin charged out of his apartment brandishing a pair of scissors and faced off against his neighbor in the hallway.
In the video, the suspect pulls out a handgun.
Mathurin spots the gun but waves it off.
He turns around and begins walking toward his fourth-floor apartment, at which point the neighbor takes aim, fires several shots and strikes Mathurin, who falls to the floor.
Mode, who was also in the hallway, tries to get away from the gunman, but the neighbor fires multiple shots at him, including at least twice after he has collapsed in a pool of his own blood.
The suspect then returns to the still-alive Mathurin and shoots him execution-style on his doorstep as the victim is struggling to rise, before calmly taking the elevator down to the lobby and fleeing.
Marie Delille, Mathurin’s grieving widow, said her neighbor fired nine shots at her husband and son in front of her 10-year-old daughter.
Nine .45-caliber shell casings and five bullet fragments were recovered from the hallway, sources told The Post.
Delille said Pass has been feuding with her family over noise for years — and NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny confirmed Tuesday that there were six previous 311 calls complaining of people walking upstairs placed from the suspect’s apartment.
âThis man hates us with every bone in his body,â Delille told CBS New York of the neighbor.
The gun Pass had used in the double-slaying was unlicensed, according to NYPD Deputy Chief Jason Savino.Â
âEssentially that was not a licensed firearm,â he told reporters Wednesday morning. âWe have a ton of investigative measures that are taking place right now, obviously [including] evidence collection comparisons and we had a pending search warrant for that vehicle. And obviously that’ll be released when the time is due.â
Pass had a prior criminal history that included a 1992 arrest for robbery.
He worked as a correction officer at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining from September 2004 to June 2005 when he was fired, a Department of Corrections and Community Supervision spokesperson said.

Teen shot outside Sardi’s in Theater District; 5 young men arrested,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T02:51:08Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/metro/nyc-shooting-leaves-teen-shot-outside-sardis-in-theater-district/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102025108id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/metro/nyc-shooting-leaves-teen-shot-outside-sardis-in-theater-district/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102025108/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/metro/nyc-shooting-leaves-teen-shot-outside-sardis-in-theater-district/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMS9tZXRyby9ueWMtc2hvb3RpbmctbGVhdmVzLXRlZW4tc2hvdC1vdXRzaWRlLXNhcmRpcy1pbi10aGVhdGVyLWRpc3RyaWN0,"A teen was shot and wounded outside of Sardiâs in Midtown Tuesday night as diners were eating inside the iconic eatery, according to police and law enforcement sources.
The gunfire rang out in front of the Theater District restaurant at 234 West 44th Street shortly after 10 p.m., police said.
A 16-year-old boy was shot and five young men were taken into custody near the scene, the NYPD said.
The teen victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital and is expected to survive, cops said.
Two Sardiâs patrons visiting the Big Apple from Seattle told The Post they saw the victim lying on the ground, but werenât sure at first if the incident was part of a prank because it was Halloween night.
âWe heard a shot, we saw people run,â Dawn Amato said. âWe thought it was a shot and the guyâs down and we donât know if itâs fake but then it turns out to be real.â
Amatoâs companion Bill Hook added, âIt kind of looked like it was a staged thing because we didnât see anyone being panicked.â
When cops quickly arrived at the scene, Hook realized the gravity of the situation though others in the restaurant who were not near the window were âobliviousâ to the shooting.
The victim was coherent when speaking with police, Hook noted.
No charges were filed as of late Tuesday night. It wasnât immediately clear what led to the shooting.
Attempts to reach Sardiâs were not unsuccessful.",N
"Armed man found dead at Colorado theme park reclusive but ‘not dangerous,’ brother says",2023-11-01,2023-11-02T03:28:58Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/brother-of-man-found-dead-at-colorado-theme-park-speaks-out/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102032858id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/brother-of-man-found-dead-at-colorado-theme-park-speaks-out/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102032858/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/brother-of-man-found-dead-at-colorado-theme-park-speaks-out/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMS9uZXdzL2Jyb3RoZXItb2YtbWFuLWZvdW5kLWRlYWQtYXQtY29sb3JhZG8tdGhlbWUtcGFyay1zcGVha3Mtb3V0,"The heavily armed man who killed himself rather than potentially carry out a mass shooting at a Colorado amusement park was a reclusive gamer obsessed with âCall of Dutyâ but not “dangerous,” according to his older brother.
David Barajas Medina, 27, told NBC News that he did not believe his 20-year-old brother, David Barajas Medina, meant to harm anyone.
Diego has been identified by the authorities as the man whose body was found in a women’s bathroom at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park Saturday next to a cryptic message scrawled on the wall that read: âI am not a killer, I just wanted to get into the caves.â
He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Garfield County Coroner Robert Glassmire said.
âI didnât think he was a dangerous person,” David said. “I’m not sure what he was setting out to do.”
The two brothers and their mother all shared a two-bedroom apartment in Carbondale, Colorado, where the younger Barajas Medina would stay up every night playing video games, his brother said.
“He wouldnât talk to any of us,” David said of his sibling, whom he described as a “quiet person.”
The 20-year-old may have been depressed, having lost his job at a Family Dollar store a year ago and struggling financially.
Diego was reselling items on Amazon to make ends meet but was behind on his share of the rent, said his brother.
He spent every night playing “Call of Duty” and went to bed at 6 a.m.
But despite his unconventional lifestyle, Diego “seemed normal,” according to David.
Diego Barajas Medina apparently entered the amusement park while it was closed, armed with an AR-style rifle, a semi-automatic handgun and explosives — both real and fake– and was wearing body armor and dark-colored tactical clothing typically worn by SWAT officers.
His brother said that Diego “always wanted to be a police officer” and had multiple guns and a tactical vest.
Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario said Monday that there were no prior red flags suggesting that Diego was planning an attack.
But Vallario pointed out at that âgiven the preparation, given the amount of weapons and ordinance he had it almost seemed very highly likely he intended to use those against the community. He chose not to.”
The weapons found on Barajas Medina were ghost guns, which do not have serial numbers and cannot be traced.
His clothing had patches and emblems similar to those worn by law enforcement officers.
Multiple improvised explosive devices were found in the vehicle used by Diego, police said.
Some of the IEDs turned out to be fake — including several that were made to look like hand grenades.
A search of Diego’s room, which he shared with his older brother, found nothing to indicate explosives or bomb-making, and he had no known criminal history or prior encounters with police, the sheriff said.
David said investigators seized Medina’s cell phone, which he had left at home, as well as a box under his bed that may have been used to store his cache of weapons.
The FBI will help comb through Medinaâs phone records and social media posts as part of the investigation.

Former high school soccer star killed by stray bullet while working at Georgia bar,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T06:11:23Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/former-high-school-soccer-star-killed-by-stray-bullet-while-working-at-georgia-bar/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102061123id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/former-high-school-soccer-star-killed-by-stray-bullet-while-working-at-georgia-bar/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102061123/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/former-high-school-soccer-star-killed-by-stray-bullet-while-working-at-georgia-bar/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMS9uZXdzL2Zvcm1lci1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1zb2NjZXItc3Rhci1raWxsZWQtYnktc3RyYXktYnVsbGV0LXdoaWxlLXdvcmtpbmctYXQtZ2VvcmdpYS1iYXI~,"A former high school soccer star was tragically killed when she was struck by a stray bullet while working at a bar in Georgia, according to police.
Brianna Long, 21, was closing up at The Pier in Remerton along with a co-worker when a fight outside led to gunfire around 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, according to The Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
Long was struck while inside the establishment. She was taken to South Georgia Medical Center where she later died from her injuries, police said.
Many patrons were outside the restaurant at the time of the shooting and several vehicles were also struck by gunfire, GBI said. No other injuries were reported.
No suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made, GBI told The Post.
“We are continuing to follow and leads, interview witnesses we identify and are processing evidence recovered from the scene,” Special Agent in Charge Jamy Steinberg said.
Long was a former standout soccer player at Paulding County High School, WSBTV reported.
While at PHS, Long was named the regional winner for Positive Athlete Georgia out of 5,000 student-athletes nominated for the award in the 2019-2020 school year.
She had been attending Valdosta State University and was expected to graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in dental hygiene in May 2024, according to her obituary.

Las Vegas man accused of shooting 9-year-old was allegedly quoting ‘Scarface’ when gun went off,2023-11-01,2023-11-02T04:41:04Z,en,nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/las-vegas-man-accused-of-shooting-boy-was-allegedly-quoting-scarface-when-gun-went-off/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102044104id_/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/las-vegas-man-accused-of-shooting-boy-was-allegedly-quoting-scarface-when-gun-went-off/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102044104/https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/news/las-vegas-man-accused-of-shooting-boy-was-allegedly-quoting-scarface-when-gun-went-off/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG55cG9zdCkvMjAyMy8xMS8wMS9uZXdzL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1tYW4tYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1zaG9vdGluZy1ib3ktd2FzLWFsbGVnZWRseS1xdW90aW5nLXNjYXJmYWNlLXdoZW4tZ3VuLXdlbnQtb2Zm,"A Las Vegas man accused of fatally shooting a 9-year-old boy in an adjacent apartment reportedly quoted âScarfaceâ before firing his rifle.
Eliazar Quintero, 41, was in his apartment entertaining two other women when his gun went off on March 7, according to an arrest warrant obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
One of the women, who was not identified, later allegedly told Metropolitan Police how Quintero walked out of his bedroom holding a rifle â and pointed it at a wall saying, âSay hello to my little friend.â
The woman said the gun then went off and Quintero seemed shocked, according to the arrest warrant.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the wall, SirArmani Clark, 9, was sitting on the couch watching âSpongebobâ with his brother, Honor Tate, 6, when the bullet pierced through their living room wall.
The bullet struck SirArmani in the head, shattering before hitting Honor in the leg.
SirAmani was then brought to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead, while his brother was being treated for his non-life-threatening wounds.
Following the shooting, multiple witnesses said they saw Quintero fleeing the apartment with multiple firearms.
Friends also told police that Quintero left firearms in their backyard and told them he needed a place to hide.
Metropolitan Police finally named Quintero as the suspect in the shooting death of SirAmani last month, saying he will now face a second-degree murder charge.
Quintero had prior convictions for possession of a controlled substance and grand theft out of California and was already in custody on gun and drug convictions, police said. He is currently serving a two to five year sentence.
Quintero was also supposed to be sentenced on a charge of ownership or possession of a firearm by a prohibited person just two days after the shooting, but failed to show up to court, according to records obtained by KLAS.
The judge then reportedly issued a bench warrant for his arrest, and he was taken into custody on March 10.
Quintero has yet to be arraigned on the murder charge, and it is unclear if he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.",N
‘More to this place than barbed wire’: South Korea reimagines its DMZ as a path towards peace,2023-11-01,2023-11-03T01:46:32Z,en,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/more-to-this-place-than-barbed-wire-south-korea-reimagines-its-dmz-as-a-path-towards-peace,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103014632id_/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/more-to-this-place-than-barbed-wire-south-korea-reimagines-its-dmz-as-a-path-towards-peace,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103014632/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/more-to-this-place-than-barbed-wire-south-korea-reimagines-its-dmz-as-a-path-towards-peace,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHRoZWd1YXJkaWFuKS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL25vdi8wMi9tb3JlLXRvLXRoaXMtcGxhY2UtdGhhbi1iYXJiZWQtd2lyZS1zb3V0aC1rb3JlYS1yZWltYWdpbmVzLWl0cy1kbXotYXMtYS1wYXRoLXRvd2FyZHMtcGVhY2U~,"A three-hour drive east from the bustling streets of Seoul, a checkpoint marks the beginning of a journey to one of the most heavily militarised borders in the world. The military police scrutinise personal identification against a pre-approved list before granting passage.
It is here, in Goseong county, in a restricted section alongside the demilitarised zone (DMZ) on the border with North Korea, that South Korea hopes to promote a literal path to peace.
The 3.6km Goseong route is one of a dozen DMZ peace trails, scattered along the border, that have been opened to tourists this year – Koreans only, for now – to encourage them to explore the idea of unity through hikes within restricted areas offering direct views into the secretive North.
The Korean war ended in July 1953 with an armistice but not a peace treaty, meaning the North and South are still theoretically at war.
On the Goseong route, an eerie calm prevails. The peaceful beach appears undisturbed. The guide shares tales of wildlife encounters, lending the surroundings the air of a leisurely Sunday walk. At one point, there’s even the chance to pat some puppies born from one of the dogs gifted by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to former president Moon Jae-in.
Yet, there are signs that betray an underlying unease: a range featuring human-shaped practice targets, watchtowers scattered here and there, the military police escort. It is as if time stands still, a haunting relic of a terrible war frozen in its tracks.
“There are few countries in the world where people live like this, divided,” says local resident Um Taek-gyu, 86, who used to work as a fisherman on the east coast. “There’s more to this place than barbed wire.”
Um is in a position to know. He was displaced from his home town only kilometres away in what is now North Korea when the war broke out seven decades ago and Goseong county was split in two. He never imagined the border would become permanent.
‘I came to see a glimpse of the true essence of peace’
Hiker Kang Min-joo was inspired to join the DMZ Freedom and Peace Grand March, a special seven-day expedition along several of these trails, to understand the past, and its influence on the future. “I wanted to remember how precious and grateful I am for the freedom and peace I have. Many young people like me have become numb to the pain of division.”
Fellow walker Kim Hak-myeon said: “Watching the birds fly back and forth between North and South Korea without any barriers, I came to see a glimpse of the true essence of peace.”
Further along the route, at the Goseong unification observation tower, visitors find themselves at a place that stands as both a vantage point and a poignant reminder of division. It is the nearest viewing point to gaze out over the Mount Kumgang range in North Korea. The coastline leading towards it seems almost within arm’s reach.
Through binoculars, visitors can peer towards the North. On the left, a road winds its way to the facility where family reunions have taken place. The most recent was in 2018, bringing together 89 elderly people who had been separated from their family members for decades.
Just 40,000 of the 133,000 people registered as part of separated families are still alive. Every month, hundreds of them pass away.
Tours to the Mount Kumgang resort – a tourism destination on North Korean soil that was a rare symbol of inter-Korean collaboration – were once part of an inter-Korean agreement but were suspended in 2008 after the shooting of a South Korean tourist. They have never resumed.
Picture-perfect coastline, with no photography allowed
At the foot of the observation tower is a cage with two white Pungsan dogs, Haerang and Kumgang: the puppies born from one of the dogs given to former President Moon Jae-in by Kim Jong-un after their historic summit in 2018.
Downhill from there is the most dramatic part of the Goseong DMZ peace trail: a short trek alongside the heavily fortified beach.
A steep descent down a set of wooden stairs leads to the sand for a picturesque walk, with the beach nestled amid breathtaking natural beauty. Here, visitors can admire turquoise waters amid the vast expanse of the ocean. For security reasons, photography is strictly prohibited.
This area is, for the most part, off-limits to civilians. On one side, a barrier is adorned with signs warning of mines, and on the other, lies a barbed wire fence with sensors detecting movement that stretches along the sandy beach.
“Korean citizens need to be pre-approved to enter this area, and only 20 people can join each DMZ path on a daily basis,” says Kim Kyung-jin from the defence ministry, who oversees projects linked to the DMZ.
Foreign tourists cannot join these trips because it is a restricted area, he says, but the defence ministry and other government bodies are in talks to create a pilot programme next year that would allow foreigners on to selected trails.
After about half an hour’s walk, escorted by several military police at the front, middle, and rear, visitors reach the Southern Limit Line. Beyond this point lies the DMZ itself , controlled by the United Nations Command on the southern side of the border situated two kilometres to the north.
This place is not without its share of incidents. Just over two years ago, a man escaped North Korea by swimming several kilometres before coming ashore in Goseong. Another defector, reportedly a professional gymnast, managed to evade detection by leaping over two sets of fences.
‘I am still heartbroken’
Next stop is the DMZ museum, where wooden boats are on display, used by defectors to reach the south in a desperate attempt to seek freedom. On 24 October, a number of North Koreans arrived on a similar boat just south of Goseong. To date, South Korea has received about 34,000 defectors. While the number of arrivals in recent years has plummeted, mostly due to the pandemic and increased border restrictions, their numbers are back on the rise.
The museum also houses exhibits on the transformation of the DMZ into a sprawling ecological park, cannon shells fired from North Korea in 2010, as well as a collection of propaganda pamphlets that provides insight into the ideological tug-of-war between the two sides. North Korean leaflets promised a socialist nirvana, while those from the South tantalised the value of freedom through seductive imagery, including women in bikinis.
Beside the propaganda exhibit is a tree and mural decorated with hundreds of messages of hope and wishing reconciliation. One read, “Even if we cannot fully reunify, let’s live in peace.”
For Um Taek-gyu, separated from his relatives all those decades ago, that pain of separation is still raw.
“Having been separated from my family has given me a lot of sorrow all this time. Even though I’m now living well, I am still heartbroken and cry once a day,” he says, as he wipes tears away.",N
