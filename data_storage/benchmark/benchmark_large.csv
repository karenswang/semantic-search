SDSO was alerted to the incident by several 911 callers who reported a ""shootout."" ""I look outside, I see a bunch of police cars. I had my car on. Like, I look outside, I see 'bang,' 'bang,' 'bang.' It’s like fireworks and stuff, a bunch of cops and I was like, 'dang that’s crazy,'"" witness Sahil Whifie said. He was with his father, Rhafie, when the shooting began. The two hid behind a car to avoid being hit by a flying bullet. No civilians were injured, SDSO said. The shooting may have happened at close-range, Nisleit said, but that will be determined by the investigation. Medical aid was given to both the suspect and the sergeant and both were taken to a hospital, SDSO said. The suspect, whose identity is being withheld, was later pronounced dead. The sergeant, who has also not been identified, was alert and talking before he was taken in for surgery, the chief said. His wife remains with him in the hospital. His injuries included, “several skull fractures, a brain bleed and some other things,"" but he was out of surgery by 10:30 a.m. and expected to make a full recovery, Nisleit said. ""Next step is just wrap our arms around him, making sure he has everything he and his family needs, taking care of his needs, and then helping him through the phases of recovery,” Nisleit said. Nisleit spoke fondly of the sergeant, who is a 6-year veteran of the force and works with the SWAT team. He was promoted by the chief himself. ""The sergeant's a heck of a guy, you know, very proud of this sergeant,"" Nisleit said. ""He’s had a great career. He’s done very well for himself, does great, has great officers working for him. I wish him nothing but a speedy recovery."" Law enforcement said there are no outstanding suspects and there is no danger to the community. Nisleit commended his officers for their handling of the situation.

The shopping center was expected to be closed until at least Friday afternoon. By 11 a.m. Friday, a few stores were cordoned off with police tape and remained closed, including a UPS Store and 4S Eye Care.

So you have somebody that openly fires on police officers, again this is my third officer that's been hit in the last 12 months ,and I've had multiple officers shot at. Yes, we're a large city, but we've not seen this kind of violence towards law enforcement in my 35-year career that I can remember. And you can tell I'm kind of fed up with it, to be honest with you. And a lot of it is because criminals are no longer being held accountable. And it's gotta stop.""

2023-12-11,"SAN DEIGO — The suspect killed by officers in a shooting at a 4S Ranch shopping center last week that also left a San Diego police sergeant seriously injured was identified by authorities on Monday. Curtis Harris, a 46-year-old San Diego resident, was named by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department as the man shot by SDPD officers overnight Friday. According to SDSO, Harris had an unserved Emergency Protection Order against him tied to a prior domestic violence incident. Authorities were alerted to the incident after receiving a report of the protection order and a possible stolen vehicle around 10 p.m. Thursday. According to SDSO, a description of the suspect in the case was identified through officers’ initial investigation, including that he was a felon and known to carry a firearm. Around 11:30 p.m., officers were able to locate the stolen vehicle in the parking lot of a shopping plaza in the 10500 block of 4S Commons Drive. According to SDSO, the location was a short distance away from the residence of the victim in the protective order signed by a judge. Officers attempted to contact Harris, who was inside a Ralph’s grocery store in the center, in order to serve him the protection order. However, SDSO said he proceeded to run outside the store, firing multiple rounds at officers. One of the gunshots struck a sergeant with the SDPD SWAT team in the head, while another hit a SDPD vehicle. The sergeant was critically injured, but as of Monday, authorities said he remains in stable condition. Three officers returned Harris’ fire, striking him multiple times. According to SDSO, he then collapsed, dropping the loaded firearm on the ground near him. An additional magazine was also found on his body. Officers attempted to render medical aid to Harris and his partner. Both were transported to separate hospitals by paramedics. He was later pronounced dead by medical personnel at about 1 a.m. Friday.

2023-12-06,"AUSTIN, Texas (KXAN) – A Texas man killed his parents and four others in a series of attacks stretching from San Antonio to Austin, authorities said Wednesday. Two police officers and a cyclist were also shot and wounded but survived, said Austin interim Police Chief Robin Henderson. Police identified the suspect as Shane James, 34, of San Antonio. He was charged with capital murder following the incident, which started Tuesday morning and ended with James crashing his car that evening during a police pursuit. James has a history of mental health problems and a prior arrest on charges of assaulting family members, authorities said. His parents, Phyllis James, 55, and Shane James Sr., 56, were found dead in their home in the San Antonio area, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said at a news conference. Four more people were found dead in two homes in Austin, more than 80 miles away, officials said. The Austin victims were not immediately identified. A timeline provided by authorities revealed the wide ground the suspect allegedly covered between the attacks. Henderson said an Austin Independent School District police officer was shot in the leg around 10:45 a.m. Tuesday in a parking lot at Northeast Early College High School. Around noon, police responded to a home after getting calls about gunshots and found two people with signs of trauma. Police said one was dead and the other died at a hospital. Another shooting happened shortly before 5 p.m. when a male cyclist suffered non-life-threatening injuries. About two hours later, police responded to a call of a burglary in progress at another home and found two people dead there. Henderson didn’t say how those four people may have been killed. During the last call, an Austin police officer saw a man in the backyard. The man shot at the officer and the officer returned fire, Henderson said. The officer suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was taken to a hospital. The officer was listed in stable condition. The suspect was chased by police until he crashed at an Austin intersection. James’ parents were found dead after his arrest. Deputies who went to their residence saw water coming out of the home and forced their way inside, Salazar said. He said the deaths appeared to have occurred before the shootings in Austin. Austin ISD officer shot at Northeast ECHS AISD Police Chief Wayne Sneed said the sergeant who was shot is responsible for several campuses and was on his daily check of Northeast Early College High School when he was attacked. At about 10:40 a.m., he called to report he was taking on gunfire from someone and had been hit in the leg. At about 10:43 a.m., a school resource officer from the campus arrived to provide backup and assisted the injured sergeant. The campus went into lockdown at 10:46 a.m. About a minute later, APD and other agencies began arriving. Sneed said at least 15 agencies responded in total. The high school did a controlled release of its students due to the ongoing investigation, according to the district. Gov. Greg Abbott released a statement Tuesday afternoon sharing his reaction to the officer being shot in the line of duty. “Our hearts are with the family and loved ones of the Austin ISD police officer who was shot near Northeast Early College High School today,” Abbott said. “Our ISD police officers play a critical role on keeping Texas students and school faculty safe. The State of Texas is offering all available resources to local law enforcement partners who are working to ensure this dangerous criminal is caught and brought to justice. Cecilia and I ask our fellow Texans to join us in praying for the officer’s swift recovery and the entire Northeast Early College High School community.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Texas man killed his parents, 4 others in a string of attacks: authorities",N
2023-12-01,"Man killed in officer-involved shooting identified Published 12:10 am Friday, December 1, 2023 KANNAPOLIS — The man killed in an officer-involved shooting on Wednesday has been identified. Lamar Deshawn Young, 33, was killed after police say he fired at them when they attempted to arrest him, according to a spokesperson for the Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Office. Police attempted to Young at a location in the 3100 block of Bellwood Place, where he allegedly believed he was meeting a 15-year-old female for sex. Upon the suspect entering the home, officers reportedly attempted to place him in custody. Reports indicated that he resisted arrest, leading to him allegedly drawing a weapon and firing at the officers. Young had been released from federal prison in January and was required to wear a GPS ankle monitor at the time of the shooting, according to the spokesperson. According to the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections, Young had previously served time for manslaughter and a drug-related charge. The manslaughter charges relate to a shooting in 2009 that left a man dead in Concord. The shooting is being investigated by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation to ensure all polices and procedures were correctly followed. All officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with policy for both the sheriff’s office and police department for all officer-involved shooting incidents, according to the release.

2023-12-12,"A person who was fatally shot by officers outside a Little Rock hotel just off of Interstate 30 on Monday reached toward his waistband for a handgun, police said Tuesday morning. Little Rock Police Department Chief Heath Helton provided the details during a news conference at department headquarters. Officers responded to a shots fired call at a Days Inn, 8219 I-30, just after 3 p.m., Helton said. A caller told police that as many as five shots were fired and that a male suspect in the gunfire left in a vehicle. The caller also reported seeing another potential suspect with a handgun, around the back of the hotel, according to the chief. Another caller told police they saw the suspect shoot into a hotel room, which was later determined to be room 110, though police said they didn't find anybody injured as a result of that gunfire. When officers arrived at the scene they found a male suspect matching the description of the suspect in possession of a gun outside the east side of the Rest Inn, 8217 I-30, according to Helton. Police said they approached the suspect and instructed him to comply with them, though he refused. He reached into his waistband for a handgun.

2023-12-13,"Philadelphia Police and the District Attorney’s Office have charged the man who injured two officers and caused a police shootout in Holmesburg, over the weekend. Police say, 40-year-old Dioul Devaughn, has been charged with 21 offenses, including Attempted Murder, Aggravated Assault, Assault on Law Enforcement Officers, Simple Assault, and other related charges as they relate to each officer. According to officials, the shooting occurred on Sunday, December 10, 2023, at 2:32 A.M., when a 2nd District sergeant responded to a radio call for a “black male wearing a tan puffy jacket in a Grey Ford Pick-up truck” firing a gun in the area of Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard. The officer located the occupied vehicle on the 7300 block of Brous Avenue, conducted a traffic stop at the intersection of Saint Vincent and Roosevelt Boulevard, and requested backup via police radio. However as the sergeant exited his marked police vehicle and approached the Dodge, Devaughn sped off. A short time later, Officers with the Highway Patrol Unit located the Dodge and attempted to do a traffic stop on 8000 Frankford Ave at Welsh Road. The officers parked their car in front of the Dodge, and Devaughn slammed into the back of the patrol car, causing major damage to the car. As the Officers exited the police car, Devaughn began firing at officers, striking one of the officers in the ankle, grazing the other in the head, and causing a graze wound on the bridge of his nose. Both Officers were able to fire back. As the shootout was going on, two additional officers arrived on the scene, parked behind the Dodge, and began firing at Devaughn, injuring him. The police car which was hit by Devaughn was struck with gunfire multiple times, causing the passenger window glass to shatter. Both injured officers were taken to Jefferson Torresdale Hospital in stable condition. They have both since been released with non-life-threatening injuries. Devaughn was transported to Jefferson Torresdale Hospital in critical condition. Police located Devaughn’s gun inside the Dodge Ram pick-up truck.

2023-12-12,"Seconds after a St. Paul police officer exited his squad car, a man ducked behind a car before shooting at the officer and the officer fired back, videos released by the police department Tuesday show. Officer Michael Tschida was shot and wounded in his leg. The officer shot Brandon Daleshaun Keys, 24, in the head and he died at the hospital early Friday. A 911 transcript, along with Tschida’s body-worn and squad dash cameras, show a woman’s desperate call for help and the intensity of the situation on a busy street in the city’s Merriam Park neighborhood. The woman called 911 Thursday afternoon and reported the father of her child was chasing her, that she had a current order for protection against him, and that he had a gun. “He just hit my car,” the woman reported, saying they were in separate vehicles. “… Oh my God. Please, I need help. … I’m trying to get away from him.” She reported he “just busted my windshield” and a male could be heard saying, “Open the door,” the 911 transcript shows. “I’m not calling the police,” the woman said and the man replied, “I just saw you.” “Brandon, I’m not,” the transcript continued. She reported she was in a silver van and he was in a blue Impala, and that the man was ramming her vehicle. “He’s gonna kill me,” she said. “God no, Brandon,” the woman could be heard saying on the call. “… No. You’re not going to jail. … Brandon, please go, leave.” The woman reported that police arrived and then she screamed, “No,” repeatedly and “Tell them stop. … Don’t shoot him,” before she asked for an ambulance to respond. Video shows officer limping, man on ground The videos show Tschida exited his squad at Cretin and Marshall avenues at 2:17 p.m. Thursday. He yelled to a man, “Get on the ground, on the ground!” That’s when the shooting happened. “Shots fired, shots fired!” Tschida relayed on his police radio. “… I’m hit!” A dispatcher called a “Signal 13,” the highest priority in St. Paul of an officer needing help. A woman ran from a silver van and to the man, and Tschida repeatedly shouted for her to move. “Get the (expletive) out of the way, so I can get him help!” Tschida yelled as she cried. The officer could be seen on video limping toward the pair, removing a handgun that was under the man’s ankle and moving it away. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating, has said they recovered a handgun at the scene. Tschida was treated and released from the hospital Thursday. He was placed on administrative leave, which is standard in such cases. Leaders respond Mayor Melvin Carter said Tuesday that St. Paul had “experienced, in one moment, two of the most horrific experiences that a community can endure.” “Both of those together are a challenging incident that leaves our city with complex layers of grief to unpack and to process,” Carter said. “We are fortunate and grateful that in this instance the injuries to Officer Tschida were non-life threatening. Our prayers, of course continue to be with him and with his family as he recovers. … We also know that we lost a community member at the same time. … We also know that that reality is traumatizing.” Carter said, in the interest of transparency, he’s committed to releasing body-camera footage after the BCA collects preliminary witness statements and the family of the deceased is able to view it. They hope the video provides “at least some clarity around some of the facts that we know very early on,” said Police Chief Axel Henry. Mark Ross, St. Paul Police Federation president, said the video shows Tschida responded “heroically” after he was shot and had no place to take cover. “This, once again, illustrates the grave danger posed to law enforcement, communities, and the decisions that must be made, in a split second, to preserve life,” said Brian Peters, Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association executive director, in a Tuesday statement. “This incident could have ended differently: the victim of domestic abuse could have died and/or the law enforcement officers or other innocent victims could have died. Enough is enough. It’s time for our leaders to stand together to denounce violent escalation on police.”","St. Paul police release body camera video of shootout that injured officer, killed man",Y
2023-12-08,"San Diego police sergeant shot, suspect dead in shootout in 4S Ranch parking lot Police said the sergeant, who is expected to survive, was shot in the head during the confrontation on 4S Commons Drive A San Diego police sergeant was shot in the head and the suspected gunman was killed after a shootout with officers in a 4S Ranch shopping center parking lot late Thursday. The sergeant, with the department for about six years, was rushed to a hospital with a skull fracture and other injuries, police officials said. He was speaking with family when he went into surgery early Friday morning and is expected to survive. Heâs the third San Diego officer to be shot in the last 12 months. Police Chief David Nisleit told reporters in front of the hospital where the sergeant was being treated that the department is ready to support him through his recovery. âThe next step is just wrap our arms around him and make sure he has everything him and his family need,â Nisleit said. Thursdayâs incident began about 10 p.m. when someone reported a stolen vehicle and provided San Diego police with a description of the person who took the car, according to the Sheriffâs Department, which is investigating the incident. Police found the car about 11:30 p.m. at the 4S Commons Town Center on 4S Commons Drive near Rancho Bernardo Road, said sheriffâs homicide Lt. Joseph Jarjura. A Ralphâs grocery store in the center would have been the only business open, and the shooting occurred outside of it. Officers found the suspect inside of the store, and as police approached, he ran out and fired at least one shot at officers, officials said. A sergeant was struck in the head. That prompted the other officers to open fire, Jarjura said. The suspect was shot multiple times. The officer and the suspect were taken to different hospitals. The suspect died about 1 a.m. The officer was in serious condition but stable, according to Jarjura. Neither of their names were released. Police recovered a firearm on the ground next to the suspect after the shooting. Four San Diego police officers were present at the time of the shooting, Jarjura said. Footage of the incident was recorded on body-worn cameras. Jarjura said that at this early stage of the shooting, the motive and circumstances remained under investigation. After the incident, Nisleit praised the work of his officers. âYou know, this is a very dangerous situation â multiple rounds being fired at officers,â he told reporters. âThe officers did a phenomenal job tonight.â Nisleit also noted the increase in gun threats that San Diego officers have had to face this year. âYou have a suspect thatâs willing to shoot at law enforcement, theyâre willing to shoot at anybody,â he told reporters. âIâm quite fed up with it.â The last time a San Diego officer was shot was June 8, when the officer was shot in the arm during a pursuit in City Heights. And on Dec. 12, 2022, Officer Javier Hernandez was shot in the chest and arm while chasing a fleeing suspect in Mountain View. Department officials say officers have been threatened with guns, shot at or shot in eight incidents this year; thatâs more than the previous two years combined San Diego officers have faced more gun threats in 2023 than the previous two years combined, according to data maintained by the departmentâs homicide unit. âIâve worked in law enforcement for over 20 years, and I have never seen it so violent,â said Jared Wilson, president of the San Diego Police Officers Association. The union president added that incidents like what happened Thursday âonly strengthen our resolve to combat crimeâ and confront people who harm others. Since January, two officers have been shot, five officers have been shot at and three officers have been threatened with firearms. And in August, a suspect fatally shot a 4-year-old police dog named Sir.

Sheriffâs officials said Curtis Harris was killed after he pulled a gun and shot at officers in the parking lot of a Ralphs grocery store, injuring a police sergeant. Someone called police about 10 p.m. to report a stolen vehicle and a prior domestic violence incident. Police said they received a suspect description and information that he was a felon and known to carry a firearm, said sheriffâs Lt. Joseph Jarjura. Sheriffâs officials are investigating the shooting under a countywide agreement that ensures no agency investigates its own police shootings. Police found the car about 11:30 p.m. at the 4S Commons Town Center on 4S Commons Drive near Rancho Bernardo Road. Jarjura said officers were trying to serve Harris with an emergency protection order when they approached him at the store. The victim in the protective order, which had been signed by a judge, lived near the shopping center, he said. It was unclear when the order had been issued or when the alleged prior domestic violence incident had occurred. Officers found the suspect inside of the store, and as police approached, he ran outside. Harris allegedly turned and fired multiple rounds at officers in the parking lot â striking a sergeant in the head. A round also struck a police vehicle, Jarjura said. Three officers fired at Harris, who was struck and fell to the ground. Police said a firearm was located near Harris, who was also carrying a loaded magazine.

2023-12-08,"A man who exchanged gunfire with a St. Paul police officer at a busy intersection Thursday has died of his injuries. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said 24-year-old Brandon Daleshaun Keys of Maplewood was the man shot by police yesterday afternoon. Keys was taken to Regions Hospital for treatment and died of a gunshot wound to the head early Friday morning. Michael Tschida was identified as the officer who shot Keys. Tschida was shot in the leg and was also taken to Regions Hospital for treatment and was released. Tschida, a 14-year law enforcement veteran, is now on administrative leave â a standard practice for officers involved in BCA use-of-force investigations. According to information gathered by the BCA so far, a woman called police to report a order for protection violation. She said she was driving with another man in her passenger seat when Keys pulled up behind her vehicle and began hitting it from behind with his own. She said Keys had a gun. The woman stopped at the intersection of North Cretin and Marshall Avenues, blocks from the University of St. Thomas, and Keys left his car to approach her vehicle. Tschida then arrived and told Keys to get on the ground. That's when BCA officials said the two exchanged gunfire. The woman and her passenger were not injured. Investigators recovered a handgun from the scene and say they are canvassing the area for witnesses, video footage and other clues to determine what happened. Tschida's body-worn-camera also captured the incident, but it's unclear if or when that will be made public. Dozens of St. Paul squad cars responded to yesterday's shooting, cordoning off blocks around the crime scene to recover evidence. Keys was due in Hennepin County District Court next Monday for a hearing in connection with a two-year order for protection secured in October by a 38-year-old woman who shares a 5-year-old child with him, according to court records. It's unclear whether she is the same woman involved in Thursday's incident. The Minneapolis woman's petition for protection alleged that Keys kept her captive in her home on Oct. 19 for 4 Â½ hours while swearing and yelling at her. ""I tried to leave, but he wouldn't let me,"" she wrote in the petition. She also had an order for protection taken out in 2018, when she alleged that Keys gave her a black eye and bruises. ""[He] has a history of beating me physically,"" she wrote. The woman added that he stalked her over the phone and kept driving by her workplace. ""He called back to back so much, I had to turn my phone off."" Keys has been convicted twice for misdemeanor domestic abuse, both times for violating an order for protection involving the same woman, court records show. One violation occurred when he broke into the woman's home in St. Cloud, caused property damage and stole items. The second violation occurred when Keys was with the woman at a county government office. That woman and Keys' parents could not be reached for comment. Tschida was one of four St. Paul police officers who fired in the killing of Jaffort Demont Smith. Police shot Smith about 3:30 a.m. May 9, 2016, in the 700 block of Buffalo Street after he fired on them and ignored repeated orders to drop his weapon following an encounter outside a towing company. Smith also had shot and wounded a 49-year-old woman with him who eventually lost her eye. A grand jury ultimately issued no charges against the officers involved. Last year Smith's family sued the officers and the city of St. Paul in federal court, alleging Smith's civil rights were violated. That lawsuit is still pending after a settlement was not reached during a conference Dec. 1. According to a Star Tribune database, at least 230 people have been killed in Minnesota during encounters with law enforcement.

Updated December 5, 2023 - 7:28 pm The man shot by Las Vegas police after allegedly stealing a tow truck and later barricading himself inside a home Wednesday night has been identified. Cristhyan Vizcarra, 39, underwent surgery at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center and remains there, Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Jamie Prosser said during a press conference Monday. Vizcarra is facing multiple charges, including two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of a stolen vehicle and one count of a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. Police responded to a call for service on Wednesday afternoon after Vizcarra allegedly pointed a gun at a tow truck driver who was trying to tow his vehicle because it was parked on private property, Prosser said. Vizcarra fled in his vehicle but later crashed near 3000 Ridge Lane, where, according to police, he then stole an unoccupied tow truck. Followed by a Metro helicopter, Vizcarra then drove the tow truck for approximately 20 minutes until he abandoned it near the 5700 block of Sand Trap Court and ran into a nearby house, where he barricaded himself. Vizcarra later left the garage on a motorcycle but was knocked off when SWAT fired several low-lethal rounds at him. He then ran, and officers pursued him on foot, police said. He was later shot after pointing a gun wrapped in a T-shirt at officers, Prosser said. Officer Coleman Oswald, 37, was later identified as the officer who shot Vizcarra. Oswald has been with the department since 2009 and is assigned to the Homeland Security and Special Operations Division. Oswald has been placed on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a review of the incident. Last week’s shooting is the eighth officer-involved shooting by Metro officers since the beginning of the year, and the fifth nonfatal shooting, police said Monday. Contact Taylor R.

2023-12-08,"The man shot by a St. Paul police officer during an exchange of gunfire died has died, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced Friday. Brandon Daleshaun Keys, 24, of Maplewood, was taken to Regions Hospital after the Thursday afternoon shooting. Officer Michael Tschida was shot in the leg during the incident. He was treated at Regions and released from the hospital Thursday. St. Paul police responded to a report of a violation of an order for protection, the BCA said of its preliminary investigation. A woman called 911 and reported a man she had an order for protection against was following her as she was driving, St. Paul police said Thursday night. She reported she was driving with a man in her passenger seat when Keys pulled behind her and starting hitting her vehicle with his, and she also told police that Keys had a gun, according to the BCA. The woman stopped at Cretin and Marshall avenues, and Keys got out of his car and approached the woman’s vehicle, the BCA said. Tschida arrived, exited his squad and ordered Keys to get on the ground. “The two exchanged gunfire, during which Keys was struck in the head and Tschida was struck in the leg,” the BCA said in Friday’s statement. Police said Thursday night that the man fired a handgun at the officer, striking him in the lower leg, and the officer returned fire. Keys died early Friday. BCA crime scene personnel found a handgun at the scene. The incident was captured on Tschida’s body-worn camera, along with other video cameras, the BCA said. The BCA said, when they complete the investigation, they will forward the findings to the Ramsey County attorney’s office for review. Recent order for protection granted A woman who was in a relationship with Keys until 2020 and had a 5-year-old child with him applied for an order for protection (OFP) in October, court records show. It wasn’t known Friday whether she was the woman who called 911 about Keys Thursday. The woman wrote in a court document that in October Keys wouldn’t let her leave for about 4½ hours. He unplugged the TV when she tried to ignore him, spit on the couch, yelled and swore at her, which made her “scared for my safety,” she wrote in a court document. He “made threats to do physical harm like, ‘You are lucky that I’m not the same person’” he once was, she wrote and noted that she previously had an OFP against him and she “knew what (Keys) is capable of doing.” The woman also wrote that Keys kept calling, driving by and coming to her work. A judge granted the protective order. A sheriff’s deputy tried to serve notice of the OFP to Keys at an address in Vadnais Heights, but the unit was vacant and mail to him was returned as undeliverable, according to court records. A hearing had been scheduled for Monday. When the woman obtained an OFP against Keys in 2018, she wrote he’d hit her in the face and previously “punched me down.” She also said he threatened her when she was pregnant. Keys was charged three times in 2019 with violating the order for protection — two of the cases were dismissed after he pleaded guilty and completed probation in March 2022, and another was dismissed when a prosecutor cited insufficient evidence to proceed. Officer’s background Tschida, who has 14 years of law enforcement experience, is on standard administrative leave. He’s previously been involved in shootings as a St. Paul officer. He and three other St. Paul officers fatally shot Jaffort Smith, 33, in 2016. The BCA said Smith shot and wounded a woman, and fired at officers. A grand jury determined the officers’ use of deadly force was justified. The police department gave Tschida a medal of valor, saying he’d “displayed great courage, teamwork and professionalism” in “a very dangerous and intense situation.” Smith’s mother filed a federal lawsuit against the city and the officers last year, saying Smith was “not a credible threat” and they’d used excessive force. The suit is ongoing. In 2015, Tschida was working security off-duty at Walmart when a man attempted to steal a wireless speaker and Tschida tried to question him. The man pointed a handgun at Tschida’s head and ran away, and Tschida ran after him and fired at him after the man pointed the gun at the officer a second time, according to state and federal charges. In 2013, Tschida tried to stop a vehicle that had a broken rear passenger window and the driver led police on a chase. The driver struck a parked car and, when he tried to exit the vehicle, police said he pointed a handgun at officers. Tschida and another officer shot and wounded the man in the leg. He turned out to be a murder suspect and was later convicted of murder. Tschida also received a medal of valor from the police department for his actions in that case.","Man shot by St. Paul officer during exchange of gunfire has died, BCA says",Y

The statement says officers responded to a report of a burglary around 6:50 p.m. that day, arriving at an Austin home just a few minutes after the call. Advertisement Article continues below this ad More For You “The initial responding officer, who was wearing an Austin Police uniform, arrived at the location and encountered a male suspect in the backyard of the residence,” the Austin PD statement reads. “The male, later identified as Shane James, immediately fired several gunshots at the officer. The officer returned fire with his department-approved firearm in the direction of Mr. James. The officer suffered multiple gunshot wounds. The officer moved to the front of the house, where he found a second officer who assisted by providing cover. It was later determined that Mr. James was not struck by gunfire during this incident.” As EMS and the Austin Fire Department attempted to render aid to the officer shot, James reportedly drove off in a stolen vehicle at the home on Austral Loop, according to the statement from Austin PD. When officers pursued James, he crashed the stolen vehicle about 4 miles west of the home, which belonged to Katherine and Lauren Short, at the intersection of State Highway 45 and FM 1826. While officers were pursuing James on the reported 4-mile chase that ended the alleged shooting spree, officers entered the Short residence to discover both women had been fatally shot. Officers say these were James’s sixth victims, saying he started his shooting spree in San Antonio earlier that day when he fatally shot both of his parents in their San Antonio-area home on the far Eastside.

2023-12-01,"INDIANAPOLIS — Indianapolis police officers shot and killed a man late Thursday night. The incident started when they got a 911 call about a possible hostage situation in a semi-truck parked in the parking lot of a McDonald’s on the southwest side of the city. The officers got to the McDonalds near the I-69 and I-465 along Knight’s Way. “The truck (in question) was pointed out to (officers) and they approached the truck, knocked on the door, and a observed male come out from the sleeping compartment of the semi cab,” said IMPD Asst.

That’s when Bailey says they heard a woman screaming calling out for help. Officers quickly got organized and tried to talk Bland out of the truck. The lead lieutenant at the scene led the effort. “The lieutenant asked the individual to identify himself. He identified himself by first name. He was trying to build a rapport,” Bailey said. “The individual kept saying that he had a knife to the woman’s throat. The woman kept saying she was bleeding.” Body camera footage caught the whole incident, according to Bailey. On that footage, he says you can see Bland on top of the woman in the back of the semi. At that point, he says a shot was fired by the officer. Bland was wounded and died soon afterward. The woman was treated for her injuries at the scene and then taken to IMPD’s Homicide Office to be interviewed about what happened. The lieutenant who fired the shot has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure. Bailey said other officers involved will also get some time off to process the incident.

2023-12-07,"RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — A new report detailing the number of officers shot in the line of duty is hitting too close to home for the greater Richmond area. The National Fraternal Order of Police released its monthly statistics on police shootings, which say that 350 police officers have been shot so far this year. Virginia has had seven officers shot so far in 2023. Four of those shootings happened since Oct. 25 in central Virginia. The total number of officers shot in Virginia in 2022 was 9. Cliff Lent, the president of security consulting company M7 Solutions, weighed in on the report’s findings. “The numbers are concerning. And they hit home. Having served for 24 years in a police department, I understand the dangers of the job. But to see fellow officers being shot at that rate is alarming,” Lent said. “It’s indicative of a breakdown in society and in a willingness to shoot at the police. And those numbers are pretty consistent not just this year, but in recent years. And there’s been an uptick in that kind of those attacks on police.” The 4 most recent incidents happened in central Virginia: - A woman was arrested for allegedly shooting a federal law enforcement officer during a barricade situation in Dinwiddie County - A special agent was grazed by a bullet while inside of an unmarked car in Petersburg - A Virginia State University campus police officer was shot and severely injured near the university’s campus - A Henrico County Division of Police officer was shot while responding to a robbery call in the Montrose area Lent said these recent shootings could potentially affect people who are considering becoming police officers. “I think it certainly gives them pause. Because the dangers are highlighted, you know, on the nightly news, when police are being shot almost on a daily rate throughout the country,” Lent said. He added that taking a moment to show appreciation goes a long way for people in jobs that put them at risk. “You can look at our public servants, whether it’s a teacher or a nurse or firefighter or police officer, and just remember to thank them for their service, because they handle situations that most of us don’t,” Lent said. Of the 350 officers shot in the line of duty this year nationwide, 42 were killed.","Seven police officers shot in Virginia so far in 2023, 4 in Richmond area",N

2023-12-07,"A man shot a St. Paul officer in the leg and the officer returned fire, critically injuring the man on a busy street Thursday afternoon, according to police. The shooting happened at Cretin and Marshall avenues just after 2 p.m., after a woman called 911 to report a man whom she has an order for protection against was following her. They were in separate vehicles and she was trying to drive away from him. The woman reported the man was intentionally driving his vehicle into her, that he was armed with a handgun and he’d broken out a window of her vehicle, said Sgt. Mike Ernster, a St. Paul police spokesman. The man was driving a blue Chevrolet Impala and the woman was in a silver van, according to emergency radio dispatches. A St. Paul officer confronted the man and the man shot him in the lower leg, Ernster said. The man shot by the officer has life-threatening injuries. It was “a scary day for St. Paul,” Mayor Melvin Carter said at a Thursday evening press conference. “One of the most scary calls that a mayor can receive is that an officer has been injured by gunfire. … We are all breathing a sigh of relief that our officer is recovering. We are in prayer alongside the families of the involved individual. And we are committed, just like we are in any incident involving an officer-involved shooting, to the highest levels of transparency and accountability.” The intensity of the situation in the Merriam Park neighborhood could be heard over the police radio as an officer relayed, “Officer shot, officer shot!” The wounded officer shouted over the emergency radio: “The next squad that pulls up, you’re taking me to Regions!,” which is what happened. Hospital staff was waiting for him. He was treated and had been released from the hospital as of Thursday night. Paramedics transported the injured man to Regions Hospital. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating. The officer who shot the man was wearing a body camera and the BCA will review the video as part of its investigation. The officer will be placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice. The woman was not injured, though Police Chief Axel Henry drew attention Thursday to domestic violence and noted there have been six such homicides in St. Paul this year. “Our officers get called to these situations — when they’re asked for help, they’re going to respond,” he said. “No one in our community, particularly our officers, wants things to turn out this way.” The police union said the officer is “doing well.” “There are heroes among us,” said Mark Ross, St. Paul Police Federation president. “He’s one of them.” The last time an officer was shot in St. Paul was in 2015 when an officer was wounded in the face by a man who fired an air-pellet gun. The time before that occurred in 2012 when a St. Paul officer was shot in the back and saved by his bullet-resistant vest, but another blast from a shotgun shredded his arm. The previous shooting by a St. Paul officer was in February, when Yia Xiong was killed in a hallway outside his apartment near West Seventh Street. The BCA has said Xiong, 65, was holding a 16-inch knife. His family and community members have been waiting for prosecutors to make a charging decision, and they’ve said they want the officers involved to be charged.","St. Paul officer, suspect wounded in shooting, police say",N
2023-12-08,"BERKELEY — Authorities released video Friday of a fatal Nov. 6 police shooting of a man who rammed a police car with a stolen vehicle and then drove onto a sidewalk — toward officers and at least one suspect — in an attempt to escape. Police have not released the name of the officer who fired. The man killed has since been identified as David Bonino, 39. Officers had been dispatched to the area of 7th and Grayson streets about 5:25 a.m. Nov. 6 for a report of three people breaking into vehicles. One suspect was detained at the scene, but Bonino, who was driving, and a woman fled in what turned out to be a stolen Ford Expedition. Officers attempted to stop the vehicle and blocked off the roadway as it headed into the surrounding streets. At one point in the video, the Expedition reappears on Grayson; it heads toward the blocked vehicle, reverses into a police vehicle that has approached from the rear, then swerves right onto a sidewalk occupied by two police officers, the suspect who had been detained, and an uninvolved pedestrian. One officer can be heard shouting out for the other officers to take cover when he sees the vehicle. He then shouts “245 (assault) on an officer! 245 on an officer!” and draws his gun as the Ford backs into the police car. As the SUV heads onto the sidewalk, the officer yells, “he’s trying to run us over!”. At that point, the officer who had been detaining the other suspect presses that suspect against a parked car, holding them both inches away from the passing Expedition, and fires a number of shots — at least six, as many as nine — at the SUV as it drives by. After the shooting, the Ford traveled forward, coming to a stop at the end of the block when it is pinned against a building by a police car. A woman inside the vehicle can be heard screaming as police begin attempting to remove Bonino and give him medical treatment. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died. Berkeley police Officer Jessica Perry said that because of the still ongoing investigations, including by the department and the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, no other information is being released at this time. She said the video and audio portions were released in the interests of transparency and so that the community could have as much information as possible when officers are involved in what she described as a critical incident.

The document also revealed the suspect had “minimal involvement in the Austin area.” The suspect was identified by the Austin Police Department as Shane James, 34. Travis County Jail records show he booked into the jail at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday and charged with capital murder of multiple people. James is due in court on Jan. 18, court records show. Police responded at 6:49 p.m. Tuesday to a burglary call in the 5300 block of Austral Loop, which is in southwest Austin. According to an affidavit, the caller reported that he was “viewing a live feed of his surveillance system” and saw a man actively breaking into his home where his wife and special needs daughter were at the time. When officers got there they saw the suspect was in the house and trying to flee out of the back of the house, the affidavit said. That’s when James shot at an officer and the officer was hit multiple times. According to APD, the officer shot back but the suspect was not hit. APD Interim Chief Robin Henderson said the officer is in stable condition. Furthermore, police said the officer was released from the hospital and recovering from his injuries. Due to the investigation involving an officer in the shooting, police said it would release more details within 10 business days, per APD protocol. Police found two victims inside the home, who were pronounced dead on the scene. APD identified the two victims as Katherine Short, 56, and Lauren Short, 30. Life-saving measures were performed but unsuccessful, the affidavit noted. According to the affidavit, James stole a car from the garage of the home on Austral Loop and drove away. The suspect was chased by police until he crashed at the intersection of State Highway 45 and FM 1826. The affidavit said during the chase, speeds reached up to 90 mph before James hit another car and crashed. KXAN has reached out to multiple agencies on details surrounding the crash but we have not yet obtained a crash report. Officers took James into custody and found a pistol in his waistband, the affidavit stated. The affidavit said after James was identified, “it was found he had minimal involvement with the Austin, Texas area.” James had an address in San Antonio, and APD requested the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office to check the residence for any injured people, according to the affidavit. BCSO went to the residence and located two people “deceased with obvious trauma to their bodies,” the affidavit said. They were later identified by BCSO as James’ parents. Shane is connected to multiple homicides and aggravated assaults in Austin and Bexar County Tuesday, Dec. 5. The affidavit said documents charging Shane with other crimes will be produced in separate affidavits.","Shooting spree suspect had ‘minimal’ connection with Austin area, affidavit says",N

Police identified the suspect as 43-year-old Kent Edwards, who they said was wanted in connection to an unsolved shooting from October.

He struck one of our larger bunkers twice, and one of our members from ESU took a projectile to his bulletproof vest."" Maddrey said the officers shot Edwards twice and pinned him down with one of the shields. Edwards was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital, where he died a few hours after the shooting. Maddrey said the officer who was hit by a bullet was also taken to an area hospital, where he is being treated and doing well. When you talk about a close call, of course it was a close call,"" Maddrey said. ""You have three bullets inside the bunkers, which could have easily been three bullets inside our officers."" Police said Edwards had 11 prior arrests dating back to 1995. Previous charges include rape, sexual abuse, strangulation, as well as failing to register as a sex offender. Maddrey said Edwards was wanted in connection to the shooting outside Izzy's, a bar, on October 18.

2023-12-07,"A man shot and injured by Long Beach police in Montebello in October was wanted on suspicion of attempting to kill a key witness in a murder case involving another member of his gang, according to a court document obtained by the Southern California News Group. The police shooting occurred Oct. 31 at a Chevron gas station at Garfield Avenue and Beverly Boulevard. In November, Long Beach police released video showing the moments leading up to a detective firing twice at Oscar Alejandro Ramires, 33, of Montebello — hitting him once in the upper body as he attempted to drive away after police surrounded him. Ramires rammed multiple civilian and police vehicles in the gas station, video shows. He had hit one undercover police SUV and one civilian SUV before the first shot was fired — a moment before the suspect hit the undercover minivan with the detective. The detective was knocked out through an open door after Ramires rammed it with his car. Ramires fled and hit another car on Via Altamira, with two occupants who were not injured, police said. Officers found him on the ground in a garage in the 600 block of the street, a block south of his home. Aside from identifying Ramires as a suspect wanted for attempted murder, police released no further details about that case. But a detective wrote in the court document that Ramires was identified as the suspect in a number of crimes, including the attempted murder of a woman Ramires, and other members of his gang, believed was going to testify against a gang member in an upcoming preliminary hearing. On Sept. 25, Ramires and another woman showed up in a car at a home in the 6000 block of Olive Avenue in Long Beach, police said. He fired four shots after the victim came to the front of the house, hitting her once in a leg, court documents show. Police initially arrested the woman during an investigation into a 2022 homicide but the District Attorney’s Office dropped the charges against her after she gave a statement to prosecutors against one of her co-defendants, the detective wrote. “Homicide detectives believe the … gang was targeting her for violence to prevent her from testifying,” police wrote in the search warrant. “This is based on multiple recorded jail calls, prison calls and social media posts.” Among the social media posts, the detective wrote, Ramires reposted one that appeared to be a $5,000 bounty targeting the woman. Before police say he shot her, Ramires was accused of pistol-whipping the woman and warning her against testifying, the detective wrote. The woman failed to appear in court and an arrest warrant was issued. The woman is now in protective custody. Police believe Ramires was also involved in a pair of car-to-car shootings in October after shell casings found at both scenes matched the markings of casings found from the shooting in the 6000 block of Olive Avenue, the detective wrote. Ramires has since been charged with attempted murder, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and dissuading a witness by force or fear, police said. He also faces a charge of assault on a peace officer and four counts of assault with a deadly weapon in relation to the Oct. 31 police shooting.

2023-12-12,"Dashboard and body camera recordings released Tuesday show that an exchange of gunfire at a busy St. Paul intersection lasted mere seconds before a police officer who was wounded in the leg returned fire at the suspect, fatally striking him in the head. St. Paul police released the video five days after the encounter Thursday at Cretin and Marshall avenues that resulted in the death of 24-year-old Brandon Daleshaun Keys, of Maplewood. Officer Michael Tschida was wounded after Keys fired within moments of Tschida's arrival at the scene, striking the officer in the leg before Tschida shot Keys. Keys died the following morning at Regions Hospital. Tschida, a 14-year law enforcement veteran, was treated and released. He was placed on administrative leave â a standard practice for officers involved in use-of-force investigations by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). ""In one moment we experienced an officer who was injured by gunfire in our community, and in that same moment we experienced an officer-involved shooting,"" Mayor Melvin Carter said. ""Trust cannot be built, cannot be established, cannot be done in the dark. Which is why transparency is such a core function."" According to the BCA, the encounter unfolded just after 2 p.m., when a woman called 911 to report that a man she knows was violating a court order for protection against him. She said the man had a gun and was hitting her vehicle with his as she drove through St. Paul with a male passenger. Transcript from the woman's 911 call suggest that Keys rammed the van she was driving with his blue Impala sedan and broke her van's windows. She told the dispatcher he was armed. ""â¦ Oh, my god, he hit me again. Oh, he's gonna â¦ kill me,"" transcript of the woman's call read. The footage showed how the shooting unfolded as soon as Tschida arrived at the scene, exited the squad and ordered Keys to the ground. Keys ducked behind a vehicle and shot at Tschida, who then returned fire. Keys, who was struck, then dropped to the ground behind the vehicle. ""Shots fired,"" Tschida repeats over his police radio, taking cover behind his squad. ""I'm hit."" The woman in question then parked her van and exited, screaming and running to Keys, who was on his back on the pavement. ""Tell 'em don't shoot, don't shoot, please,"" the woman told 911, according to call transcripts. ""He's down. No, he don't have a gun. No please. Send an ambulance, please."" Tschida then yelled at the woman to step away from Keys, who cannot be seen from behind the vehicle. Bystanders also urged the woman to step away from Keys as Tschida limped toward him, picked up the gun where it lay near his feet and moved it away. The footage then ended as multiple squads arrive to the scene. ""The events that transpired on [that day] will have a lasting effect in our community, particularly to our first responders, particularly to our officers, paramedics dispatchers and our professional staff,"" Police Chief Axel Henry said. ""Healing is a process that takes time, patience and support. But we stand here as one community and we will do everything we can to support one another while the BCA completes this investigation."" Keys was due in Hennepin County District Court this week for a hearing in connection with a two-year order for protection secured in October by a 38-year-old woman who shares a 5-year-old child with him, according to court records. It's unclear whether she is the same woman involved in Thursday's incident. She also had an order for protection taken out in 2018, when she alleged that Keys gave her a black eye and bruises. ""[He] has a history of beating me physically,"" she wrote. Keys has been convicted twice for misdemeanor domestic abuse, both times for violating an order for protection involving the same woman, court records show. Tschida was one of four St. Paul police officers who fired their weapons in the killing of Jaffort Demont Smith on May 9, 2016. Smith ignored orders to drop his weapon after he had shot and wounded a 49-year-old woman with him who eventually lost an eye. A grand jury ultimately issued no charges against the officers involved. Last year, Smith's family sued the officers and the city of St. Paul in federal court, alleging Smith's civil rights were violated.

2023-12-04,"LAUREL CANYON—The Los Angeles Police Department’s Force Investigation Division is investigating an Officer-Involved Shooting that transpired in the North Hollywood Division on November 30 around 2:30 p.m. Patrol officers responded to a radio call for an “Assault with a Deadly Weapon, suspect there now,” at a business located at the 7500 block of Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The suspect later identified as Francisco Javier Alba, 52, assaulted an employee inside the location and exited before walking across the street to the west sidewalk. Officers arrived at the location and spoke with the victim, who provided details of the incident, which described that a misdemeanor battery and vandalism occurred. The victim described Alba as the suspect but declined to make a private person’s arrest. Officers exited the business and returned to their police cruiser where they began to complete the associated crime reports, when Alba returned. He approached the officers while holding a drywall hammer with combined hatchet blade in his hand and appeared to be wearing numerous layers of clothing. Alba began arguing with the officers when they ordered him not to return to the business. The suspect walked across the street to the west sidewalk while becoming increasingly agitated. Officers requested an additional unit for a “415 man” and for approximately 30-35 minutes continued to order Alba to leave the area and drop the bladed hammer. Alba started crossing the street toward the officers with the hammer in his hand. Officers gave Alba numerous orders to stop, get out of the street and drop the hammer. He refused to comply with commands resulting in officers utilizing numerous less lethal munitions including a TASER, 40mm less-lethal-launchers and beanbag shotguns, which were ineffective. Alba continued to advance towards one officer, while still armed with the hammer in his hand stating, “Shoot it, shoot it,” at which point an Officer-Involved Shooting occurred. He was struck by gunfire, fell to the ground and was taken into custody without further incident. Personnel from the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the scene and transported Alba by rescue ambulance to Holy Cross Medical Center where he was admitted for gunshot wounds and listed in stable condition. A drywall hammer with combined hatchet blade was recovered from the scene and booked as evidence. No officers or other community members were injured as a result of this incident. The LAPD’s specialized Force Investigation Division responded to the scene, interviewed witnesses, and supervised the collection of evidence by the Forensic Science Division personnel. The complete investigation will be reviewed by the Chief of Police, the Board of Police Commissioners, and the Office of the Inspector General to determine the thoroughness and accuracy of the investigation and whether the use of deadly force complied with LAPD’s policies and procedures.",Officer-Involved Shooting Unfolds On Laurel Canyon Blvd,N
2023-12-01,"IMPD on fatal police shooting inside semitruck: ‘This officer saved a woman’s life’ One person dead in southwest side police shooting – News 8 at 10:30 p.m. UPDATE: The Marion County Coroner’s Office identified the suspect shot and killed by police as 60-year-old Lamont Bland. INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — The male driver of a semitruck died in a police shooting Thursday night after a 911 caller told police they heard a woman yelling for help inside the parked vehicle near a restaurant on the southwest side of Indianapolis. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department says no officers were hurt. Medics treated the woman at the scene before she was taken to the downtown IMPD homicide office to be interviewed. Police hoped to learn the relationship between her and the driver. The name of the driver nor the woman were publicly shared Thursday night. IMPD was sent to a “call for help” involving a hostage situation about 7:20 p.m. Thursday at McDonald’s, 4941 Knights Way. That’s in an area with restaurants, hotels and truck stops just southwest of the interchange for I-69 and I-465. Medics were called to the scene for a person shot just before 7:45 p.m. Thursday. Lt. Shane Foley of IMPD says officers arrived to learn of a disturbance inside the semitruck and then forced their way into the cabin. The officers saw what appeared to be a hostage situation, Foley says. Assistant Chief Chris Bailey described what happened during an impromptu news conference about 10:30 p.m. that aired live on News 8. He talked about a lieutenant who moved into the cab to try to talk to the driver before the fatal shooting. “Tonight, this officer saved a woman’s life,” he said. Officers arrived and spoke with the 911 caller, who pointed out the semitruck. They knocked on the door and saw the driver come from behind a curtain that separates the driving compartment from the sleeping compartment. Police tried to talk to the driver, who briefly sat in the driver’s seat before returning back to the sleeping compartment. “That’s when the officers heard themselves a female scream from the back of that truck,” Bailey said. Officers sat up around the semitruck and made announcements. Eventually, police decided to break out the driver’s-side window to better see into and hear from the cab. In addition to the curtain separating the compartments, a curtain also was over the driver’s-side window. Bailey said, “The lieutenant at one point opened the door and began communicating with the male inside … the truck. The lieutenant asked the individual to identify himself. The lieutenant identified himself by first name. He was attempting to build a rapport with this individual. This individual kept saying he had a knife to the woman’s throat. All the while, the woman could be heard screaming that she was bleeding and needed help. This went on for a few minutes. “The lieutenant, in my opinion, bravely inched into the car on multiple occasions to move the curtain back so he could see and continue to try to communicate with the individual inside the cab.” IMPD later reported that the driver told officers multiple statements, including âIâm going to kill her,” âI got a knife to her throat,â and âYouâre gonna die.â Eventually, the lieutenant got inside the semitruck and gave the driver orders again. “You can briefly see, on the bodycam, the individual on top of the woman in back of the car. A shot was fired by the officer. The suspect was deceased inside the cab of the truck,” Bailey said. The assistant chief says other officers then came and freed the woman from the semitruck. Officers were seeking other witnesses at the scene in addition to the 911 caller. IMPD about 8:45 p.m. Thursday was awaiting warrants to search the semitruck, but the investigators were inside the semitruck by 10:30 p.m. An IMPD news release issued about 11:20 p.m. said a razor blade with blood was found in the sleeping cabin. Multiple officers were equipped with body-worn cameras, which were activated.â¯ As is standard procedure, investigations will look into what happened and the police procedures used. The lieutenant will be placed on administrative leave. Bailey says other officers on the scene also may receive time off to process what happened. The police shooting was the 17th in 2023. It’s the most police shootings since 20 were recorded in 2015. Police generally release the names of officers in the shootings about a week after they happen. Bodycam footage is usually shared a few weeks later. Earlier this month, IMPD revealed it’s reached out to the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum to submit a bid to conduct a study on what’s causing so many police shooting to happen. However, that process has yet to come to fruition, Bailey said Thursday night. After another police shooting, IMPD Deputy Chief Kendale Adams spoke at an August event, where he acknowledged the need for a larger conversation about what it looks like to deal with mental health, disputes, and trauma.

2023-12-13,"Supported by The Failed Promise of Police Body Cameras U.S. taxpayers spent millions to fund what was supposed to be a revolution in accountability. What went wrong? When Barbara and Belvett Richards learned that the police had killed their son, they couldn’t understand it. How, on that September day in 2017, did their youngest child come to be shot in his own apartment by officers from the New York Police Department? Miguel Richards, who was 31, grew up in Jamaica and had moved to New York about a year earlier after coming to the United States through a work-study program. His father’s friend gave him a job doing office work, and he rented a room in the Bronx. But he started to struggle, becoming reclusive and skipping days of work. His mother, with whom he was particularly close, pleaded with him to return to Jamaica. “It’s as if I sensed something was going to happen,” she says. “I was calling him, calling him, calling him: ‘Miguel, come home. Come home.’” His parents knew he had never been violent, had never been arrested and had never had any issues with the police. What details they managed to gather came from the Bronx district attorney: Richards’s landlord, who hadn’t seen him for weeks, asked the police to check on him. The officers who responded found Richards standing still in his own bedroom, holding a small folding knife. And 15 minutes later, they shot him. Richards’s death marked a historic turning point. It was the first time a killing by officers was recorded by a body camera in New York. The new program was announced just months before as heralding a new era of accountability. Now, a week after the shooting, the department posted on its website a compilation of footage from four of the responding officers. The video, the department said in an introduction to the presentation, was produced “for clear viewing of the event as a totality.” And as far as the department was concerned, the narrative was clear. Sometimes “the use of deadly force is unavoidable,” the police commissioner at the time, James O’Neill, wrote in an internal message. The level of restraint shown by all officers, he said, is “nothing short of exceptional.” And, he added, “releasing footage from critical incidents like this will help firmly establish your restraint in the use of force.” Richards’s parents were not convinced. Belvett watched footage at the district attorney’s office. What he saw, and what was released, did not, in fact, show that the use of deadly force was unavoidable. He later learned that the department had not released all the footage. What else didn’t they know about their son’s death? When body-worn cameras were introduced a decade ago, they seemed to hold the promise of a revolution. Once police officers knew they were being filmed, surely they would think twice about engaging in misconduct. And if they crossed the line, they would be held accountable: The public, no longer having to rely on official accounts, would know about wrongdoing. Police and civilian oversight agencies would be able to use footage to punish officers and improve training. In an outlay that would ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the technology represented the largest new investment in policing in a generation. Yet without deeper changes, it was a fix bound to fall far short of those hopes. In every city, the police ostensibly report to mayors and other elected officials. But in practice, they have been given wide latitude to run their departments as they wish and to police — and protect — themselves. And so as policymakers rushed to equip the police with cameras, they often failed to grapple with a fundamental question: Who would control the footage? Instead, they defaulted to leaving police departments, including New York’s, with the power to decide what is recorded, who can see it and when. In turn, departments across the country have routinely delayed releasing footage, released only partial or redacted video or refused to release it at all. They have frequently failed to discipline or fire officers when body cameras document abuse and have kept footage from the agencies charged with investigating police misconduct. Even when departments have stated policies of transparency, they don’t always follow them. Three years ago, after George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers and amid a wave of protests against police violence, the New York Police Department said it would publish footage of so-called critical incidents “within 30 days.” There have been 380 such incidents since then. The department has released footage within a month just twice. And the department often does not release video at all. There have been 28 shootings of civilians this year by New York officers (through the first week of December). The department has released footage in just seven of these cases (also through the first week of December) and has not done so in any of the last 16. Asked about the department’s limited release of footage, a spokesperson pointed to a caveat, contained in an internal order, that footage can be withheld because of laws or department policy. “The N.Y.P.D. remains wholly committed to its policy of releasing such recordings as quickly and responsibly as circumstances and the law dictate,” the spokesperson wrote. “Though transparency is of the utmost importance, so too is the Police Department’s commitment to preserving privacy rights.” The department did not say which policies require the withholding of footage and did not address other questions about its record on the cameras. (Mayor Eric Adams’s spokesman did not make him available for comment.) For a snapshot of disclosure practices across the country, we conducted a review of civilians killed by police officers in June 2022, roughly a decade after the first body cameras were rolled out. We counted 79 killings in which there was body-worn-camera footage. A year and a half later, the police have released footage in just 33 cases — or about 42 percent. This article is the product of more than six months spent investigating how the police have undermined the promise of transparency and accountability that accompanied the body-camera movement. We interviewed dozens of department insiders, government lawyers, policing experts and advocates and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal reports, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and dozens of hours of surveillance-camera and body-camera footage, including some that the New York Police Department fought against disclosing. The reporting reveals that without further intervention from city, state and federal officials and lawmakers, body cameras may do more to serve police interests than those of the public they are sworn to protect. To Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who is now a professor at the Joseph F. Rice School of Law at the University of South Carolina, body cameras represent the latest chapter in America’s quest for a technological fix to the deeply rooted problem of unchecked state power. “Dash cams were supposed to solve racial profiling,” he says. “Tasers and pepper spray were supposed to solve undue force. We have this real, almost pathological draw to ‘silver bullet’ syndrome. And I say that as a supporter of body-worn cameras.” He later added: “We just said to police departments: ‘Here’s this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.’ It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re going to use it in a way that most benefits them.” Jeff Schlanger, a former New York deputy commissioner who had an oversight role during the implementation of body-worn cameras and left the department in 2021, believes that the police have often failed to use the cameras for accountability and that political leaders need to do more. “Mayors, City Council members, all locally elected officials,” he says, “should be losing sleep over the lack of meaningful independent oversight of the police.” The shooting of Miguel Richards was the first to be recorded by N.Y.P.D. body cameras. Police Commissioner James O’Neill wrote in an internal message that releasing footage would show officers’ “restraint in the use of force.” Below are clips from the videos the police initially released. They contain graphic content. Officers answered a call for a wellness check and found Richards standing still in the far corner of his bedroom, holding a small folding knife. “Look, we could shut the door,” Officer Redmond Murphy said at one point. Instead, they shouted at him for the next 15 minutes. Officer Murphy says he thinks he sees something in Richards’s hand: “I don't know if it's a toy or a gun.” Officer Mark Fleming says, “I don't want to shoot you if you’ve got a fake gun in your hand. You hear me? But I will shoot you if that's a real gun.” A radio command from headquarters reminded the officers of N.Y.P.D. guidelines to “isolate and contain” a person in a mental-health crisis and to “use nonlethal force whenever possible” as they faced Richards. Fifteen minutes after arriving, they opened fire. An internal investigation later found that Richards “was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.” When full footage has been released, often by prosecutors or after public pressure, it often contradicts initial police accounts. In 2015, a white officer in Cincinnati killed a Black man during a traffic stop. The officer said his life was in danger. But his body-camera video showed that was a lie, and he was prosecuted for murder (charges were dropped after two mistrials). And in Philadelphia this August, an officer shot and killed a man after, the police said, he lunged at officers with “a weapon.” In fact, footage released by the district attorney — who charged the officer with murder — shows that the man was sitting in his own car. In New York, Miguel Richards’s parents weren’t the only ones who had doubts about the department’s claims that the shooting was unavoidable. The footage the department released stopped right when the officers fired at Richards. It didn’t include the minutes after the shooting, and it didn’t include footage from other police units that responded. Ruth Lowenkron, a disability rights lawyer who specializes in mental-health issues, wanted to see it all. Working for New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a legal-advocacy nonprofit, she and her colleagues, along with activists, had begun pushing the city to find an alternative to using the police as first responders to people in crisis. On her second day on the job, a sergeant shot and killed a 66-year-old woman who had schizophrenia and was holding a baseball bat in her Bronx apartment. The department’s own investigators concluded that the sergeant escalated the situation and caused the shooting. Now, watching the video the department released of Richards’s shooting, Lowenkron feared that the same thing happened to him. The department’s edited footage showed the officers making a few attempts to connect with Richards early in the encounter. “What’s your name, man?” one officer asked. But they were also barking increasingly terse commands. “You are seconds away from getting shot,” one officer said. “Do you want to die?” A few minutes later, as one of them warned that Richards might have a gun, the officers fired. Lowenkron filed a records request, certain that there was more to the story. In releasing the partial footage, the police commissioner had vowed that the “N.Y.P.D. is committed to being as transparent as possible.” But nearly three weeks after her request, Lowenkron received a different message from one of the department’s records officers: “I must deny access to these records.” Body-worn cameras were adopted by police departments across the country in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests in 2014, sparked when Michael Brown was killed by the police in Ferguson, Mo. The officer who shot Brown was not equipped with a camera, and there was a dispute about what happened in the last moments of Brown’s life. Amid deep schisms over race, justice and policing, there was at least agreement that police interactions should be recorded. Brown’s mother pressed for the technology to become standard equipment. “Please,” she begged Missouri legislators, “let police-worn body cameras be a voice of truth and transparency.” President Barack Obama put the cameras at the center of his plans to restore trust in policing. Cities quickly began spending millions on the devices, expenditures that continue today for storage and software. Los Angeles has spent nearly $60 million since getting cameras in 2016. In Philadelphia, where footage is rarely released, the cameras have cost taxpayers about $20 million. New York City has spent more than $50 million. But whether citizens benefit from the cameras they’re paying for is often up to the police, who have often been able to keep footage hidden from the public in even the most extreme cases. In 2018 in Montgomery, Ala., an officer unleashed his police dog on a burglary suspect without warning, severing the Black man’s femoral artery and killing him. The police and the city have refused to release footage for five years, arguing that it could cause “civil unrest” and that the officers could face “embarrassment.” But a lawyer for the man’s family, which is suing the city, got a copy of the transcript in the discovery process and entered it into the court record. “Did you get a bite?” an officer asked the one who had the dog, according to the document. “Sure did, heh, heh,” the K-9 officer responded. The secrecy undercuts the deterrent effect on officer behavior that many had presumed body cameras would produce. Three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck, body-camera video caught him kneeling on the necks of others. In 2017, Chauvin dragged a handcuffed Black woman out of her house, slammed her to the ground and then pressed his knee into her neck for nearly five minutes. Three months later, Chauvin hit a 14-year-old Black boy at least twice in the head with a heavy flashlight, choked him and pushed him against a wall. The boy cried out in pain and passed out. Chauvin pushed a knee into his neck for 15 minutes as the boy’s mother, reaching to help him, begged, “Please, please do not kill my son!” The footage was left in the control of a department where impunity reigned. Supervisors had access to the recordings yet cleared Chauvin’s conduct in both cases. Minneapolis fought against releasing the videos, even after Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal civil rights violations in one of the cases. A judge finally ordered the city and the police to release the tapes this April, six years after Chauvin abused the boy. “Chauvin should have been fired in 2017,” says Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented both of the victims. If the police had done that, “the city never burns. We’d have a downtown still. It’s a parade of horribles. All to keep something secret.” A Department of Justice report from this summer found that the secrecy and impunity was all part of a larger pattern in the Minneapolis Police Department. Shootings, beatings and other abuse had routinely been captured on video. But the department didn’t make the footage public or mete out punishment. There was a similar dynamic in Memphis, where officers in a street-crimes unit regularly abused residents. They wore body cameras but faced no consequences until the case of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death this January by officers in the unit, attracted national attention. The footage showed that some of the officers took their cameras off. Others knew they were being recorded and pummeled Nichols anyway. It was only after public outcry that the department took the rare step of releasing footage, which contradicted initial police accounts and led to state and federal charges for five officers. Some politicians have often quietly enabled obstacles to this kind of accountability. When South Carolina became the first state in the nation to require the use of cameras in 2015, Nikki Haley, the governor at the time, made the announcement with the family of Walter Scott standing behind her. Scott was a Black man who, two months earlier, was stopped by the police for a broken taillight and was shot in the back and killed when he tried to run away. A witness filmed the shooting, and that video contradicted official police accounts. “This is going to make sure Walter Scott did not die without us realizing that we have a problem,” Haley said as she signed the legislation. What the governor didn’t say was that the same law stipulated that footage from cameras is “not a public record subject to disclosure,” thus relieving police departments from any obligation to release it. And indeed, little footage has ever become public in South Carolina. In 2021, York County sheriff’s deputies responding to a call for a wellness check found a young man sitting in his pickup truck with his mother standing next to him. They fired at him nearly 50 times. The sheriff, who refused to release body-camera footage, said the man pointed a shotgun at deputies. When the man, who survived, obtained the footage after suing, it showed no such thing. So far this year, the police in South Carolina have killed at least 19 people. The police have released footage in only three of those cases. When we asked one department, the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office, why it had not, a spokesperson pointed to the law, writing, “We never release that footage.” The pattern has become so common across the country — public talk of transparency followed by a deliberate undermining of the stated goal — that the policing-oversight expert Hans Menos, who led Philadelphia’s civilian police-oversight board until 2020, coined a term for it: the “body-cam head fake.” And there is no place that illustrates this as well as New York City, the home of the world’s largest municipal police force, some 36,000 officers strong. New York’s adoption of body-worn cameras started with a moment of unintentional inspiration. In 2013, Judge Shira Scheindlin was hearing testimony in a federal lawsuit in which multiple advocacy groups claimed that the Police Department’s aggressive “stop and frisk” policy was racially biased and unconstitutional. One day during the trial, an expert witness for the city mentioned a new tool for accountability — body-worn cameras — in passing. “My head snapped when I heard the words,” Scheindlin recalled this year. “I thought, That could be a useful remedy!” Two months later, Scheindlin issued a historic ruling that New York’s stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional. She ordered the Police Department to begin piloting body-worn cameras, writing that they were “uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional harms at issue in this case.” Scheindlin laid out three different ways the cameras would help: “First, they will provide a contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks.” She continued: “Second, the knowledge that an exchange is being recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties. Third, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is their word against the police.” But in a preview of obstacles that would follow, the department was slow to roll out the devices, even as they were becoming common in other cities. More than two years after Scheindlin’s ruling, the department hired researchers at New York University to conduct a survey about what residents wanted from a body-camera project. The community’s answers were overwhelming and clear: transparency and disclosure. Officers, however, wanted the opposite. They were concerned that the recordings would “show a different side of the story than what would otherwise be told,” according to a separate N.Y.U. survey. To Scheindlin and the plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk case, that was exactly the point. When the department released its policy in April 2017, it was clear whose opinions held more sway. No video would automatically become public. Anyone that requested it would have to go through an opaque, often slow-moving Freedom of Information process — in which the department itself would be the arbiter of what would be released (though the courts could review that decision). ‘The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early—warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes.’ The policy blunted the technology’s potential for accountability in other ways. Officers could decide when to start filming, instead of at the beginning of all interactions as the public wanted. And while the public had little access to footage, the police had privileged access: Officers who were the subjects of complaints would be allowed to watch the footage before having to give any statements — something that could allow them to tailor their accounts to the video. The policy was “so flawed that the pilot program may do little to protect New Yorkers’ civil rights,” Ian Head and Darius Charney of the Center for Constitutional Rights wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times. “Instead, it might shield police officers from accountability when they engage in misconduct.” Still, on April 27, 2017, Commissioner James O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio held a news conference at a precinct in Washington Heights to celebrate the rollout of body-worn cameras. Stepping up to the lectern, O’Neill said he was initially skeptical of the cameras but had become a believer. “I’m totally convinced now that this is the way forward,” he said. “These cameras have a great potential to de-escalate.” Then the mayor went to the lectern. Officers had long felt that de Blasio, a self-proclaimed progressive, was too supportive of Black Lives Matter protests and not sufficiently supportive of the police. That sentiment turned into rage when a man espousing hatred of the police murdered two officers in late 2014. Hundreds of police officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funerals. Ever since, de Blasio had been working to repair the relationship. “This is an historic day for New York City,” de Blasio said, with O’Neill by his side. “This is the first day of the era of body-worn cameras, and that means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability that will benefit everyone.” Five months later, officers killed Miguel Richards, making his case the first in which the potential of body-camera video would be tested. But Ruth Lowenkron, the public-interest attorney who filed a request for the footage, was getting little from the Police Department. After it rejected her initial request, she appealed the decision. The department sent her some redacted footage but again rejected her request for all of it. Disclosing the full footage would be an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” the department wrote. Whose privacy — the dead man’s or the officers’ — was not explained. Releasing the full footage, the department insisted, could “endanger the life or safety of any person.” The letter came from the department’s legal unit, led by its deputy commissioner, Larry Byrne, who was known for his fierce advocacy for the department. From the outset of the body-worn-camera program, Byrne made it clear that he was resistant to widespread release of footage. “They are not public records in the sense that, because the officer turns the camera on, they are now in the public domain,” Byrne told NY1 in 2015. In fact, he insisted, “most of this footage” would never be made public. Lowenkron kept requesting the Richards footage and kept getting rejected or sent redacted video. In July 2018, she and her colleagues decided to file a lawsuit in state court demanding the full footage. They even got a former Police Department lawyer, Stuart Parker, to help litigate the suit pro bono. The department’s various explanations for its denials “pissed me off,” Parker recalls. He retired from the department as an assistant commissioner in 2016, the year before cameras were widely rolled out. But he had been excited by their potential and was frustrated by the department’s kneejerk secrecy. “There’s a good side to the department,” he says, “but there’s always been a self-serving dark side to it too.” In response to the suit, the department argued in legal filings that it had blurred the footage “in order to protect the privacy of both Richards and his family.” But Lowenkron and her team had obtained affidavits from Richards’s parents saying that the department never asked them whether they wanted the footage released or redacted. And what the Richardses wanted, they said, was for the full footage to be released to the public. Public disclosure of footage isn’t the only path to hold officers in New York accountable for misconduct. For 70 years, the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board had been vested with the responsibility to investigate New Yorkers’ allegations against the police. From the start, though, its powers were weak. The agency was actually part of the Police Department, and its board consisted of three deputy police commissioners. The department fought efforts over the years to make the agency independent. In the face of a plan in the mid-1960s to include civilians on the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the head of the largest police union, then called the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said, “I’m sick and tired of giving in to minority groups with their whims and their gripes and shouting.” The agency eventually became independent in 1993 after stiff opposition months before from off-duty officers. Thousands of them — along with Rudy Giuliani, then a mayoral aspirant after losing the previous election — staged a huge protest outside City Hall, with many of them going on to block the Brooklyn Bridge. After the changes, the review board still relied on an often noncooperative Police Department for records, and its investigations frequently petered out amid competing accounts. And like many civilian oversight boards across the country, in the rare cases where it substantiated misconduct, it could only recommend discipline to the police commissioner, who could and often did ignore it. Many civilians, whom the board relied on to initiate complaints, had long grown skeptical of the agency’s ability to ensure that officer misconduct had consequences. But the advent of body-camera video promised to fundamentally change how the agency worked. For the first time, staff members would have an objective record of the incidents they investigated. That was Nicole Napolitano’s hope when she joined the review board as its new director of policy and advocacy in September 2017 — the same year body cameras were rolled out in New York and one week after officers killed Richards. “We talked about it in detail” at the agency, she says of the initial footage of the Richards shooting. “We thought, Look at what body-worn cameras can show us.” Napolitano, who is married to a retired detective, knew it would be a challenge. As a senior policy manager in the Office of the Inspector General for the New York Police Department, she had seen how the department could simply ignore the recommendations in her reports. Napolitano hoped she would have more direct impact in her new, more senior position at the review board. But what she hadn’t appreciated was how much the police controlled the literal tools of their own oversight. As with most civilian boards across the country, the agency did not have its own access to footage. Like the public, it, too, had to rely on the cooperation of the department. To try to obtain footage, the board had to navigate a baroque multistep process. Written requests were submitted to a department “liaison” unit, which in turn forwarded them to the legal unit for review. Then the department had to locate the footage, which was a significant undertaking because it wasn’t cataloging the footage in any systematic way. Unlike in many other cities, the department’s cameras had no GPS location data. If a civilian making a complaint didn’t know an officer’s name or badge number, investigators and even the department could have a hard time finding footage. Perhaps most problematic for Napolitano, though, was the fact that the review board’s investigators had to agree to a strict set of conditions before watching videos of incidents. If they spotted other, unrelated misconduct, they were not allowed to investigate it. “If you were setting up a system to be shitty,” one agency insider says, “this is the system you’d create.” At times, the department’s animosity toward the board was palpable. Napolitano remembers one meeting in 2017 between board officials and Kerry Sweet, then a top official at the department’s legal bureau who helped oversee the body-camera rollout. As other police brass shuffled in, Sweet said they had missed a chance to “bomb the room” when only board officials were there, which would have “solved everything.” (Sweet, who has since retired, says he doesn’t recall saying that, but added, “On reflection, it should have been an airstrike.”) Napolitano and her colleagues noticed an even more troubling trend: The department would often tell the review board that the footage it requested didn’t exist — only for the civilian agency to later discover that wasn’t true. According to an analysis the agency put out in early 2020, this happened in nearly one of every five cases. Napolitano thought there was a straightforward solution to the department’s stonewalling: The review board should be able to directly log in to the department’s system where footage is stored. That’s how it worked with civilian oversight boards in a few other major American cities, including Chicago, which revamped civilian oversight after Laquan McDonald was killed in 2014 and the city tried to withhold footage that contradicted officers’ accounts. Chicago’s oversight board now not only has direct access to videos but also regularly releases footage publicly, and its investigators have used it to successfully push for officers to be fired for misconduct. Napolitano didn’t see a reason for it to be otherwise in New York. So in her first semiannual report, at the end of 2017, she noted the challenges of getting footage — and called on the city to give the review board direct access. Both the department and City Hall, Napolitano says, “freaked” out. “It was a rough time for de Blasio when it came to public safety,” Napolitano added, referring to the mayor’s tenuous relationship with the police. “In a dispute between C.C.R.B. and N.Y.P.D., City Hall always chose the N.Y.P.D. Always.” “I don’t agree,” de Blasio says. “The tension between the C.C.R.B. and the N.Y.P.D. is natural and built-in. I decided each issue on the merits and according to my values.” He went on: “The blunter truth is when a progressive challenges the police culture and the police unions and the status quo of American policing, the left is not going to have their back. You’re not getting that thank-you card. And the right will viciously attack.” While the department fought Lowenkron and Napolitano on the release of body-camera footage, there was one group that had access to all of it and could use it to check for misconduct: the department’s own investigators. After every police shooting, detectives with the Force Investigation Division review the incident to see whether officers complied with department policy. The Richards case was the first time body-worn-camera footage could let them see what actually happened in a killing by officers. As investigators dug through the video and interviewed officers in the weeks and months after the shooting, they saw a far more complicated picture than the one the police commissioner painted. As the tape began, one officer, Mark Fleming, beamed his flashlight into the far side of Richards’s nearly bare, unlit bedroom. Richards was standing perfectly still in the dark, seemingly catatonic, wearing a blue polo shirt and sunglasses and holding a knife in his left hand. Department guidelines for dealing with people in crisis who do not pose an immediate threat say officers should try to “isolate and contain” the person. “The primary duty of all members of the service is to preserve human life,” department policy states. Officers are also instructed to wait for a supervisor’s permission before trying to subdue someone in crisis. At first, it appeared that the officers who encountered Richards were following their training. “Look, we could shut the door,” Officer Redmond Murphy suggested to his partner. But Fleming, who had served more years in the department, quickly rejected the idea. He kept telling Richards to drop the knife, and he radioed for an officer with a Taser. Two officers from the specially trained Emergency Services Unit, which deals with people experiencing mental-health crises, arrived. Then Murphy said he thought he saw something, perhaps a gun, in Richards’s right hand, which was obscured behind a backpack on the bed. “Hold up,” one of the E.S.U. officers told Fleming and Murphy before heading back downstairs to grab protective gear. “I don’t know if it’s a toy or a gun,” Murphy quickly added. As the specialists went downstairs, the officer with the Taser, Jesus Ramos, went upstairs and joined Fleming and Murphy outside Richards’s room. “Do you want to take him down now?” Ramos asked them. “Yeah,” they both answered. At nearly the same moment, a radio command came from headquarters, emphasizing department guidelines. “Isolate and contain,” the dispatcher told the officers. “Use nonlethal force whenever possible.” As Ramos lifted his Taser and stepped into the room, Fleming — who later said Richards was raising his arm — fired his gun. Murphy fired, too. It’s impossible to see that moment in the grainy, shaky footage. The clearest angle would most likely have been Fleming’s camera, but it was covered by his arm as he held his flashlight. Fleming and Murphy fired 16 times, hitting Richards seven times, including twice in the chest, rupturing his aorta. As gunshots rang out, the supervisor they were supposed to wait for arrived. (None of the officers responded to requests for comment.) The internal investigators asked the officers to explain. “We kind of handle everything on our own,” Murphy offered. An internal investigator pressed Fleming about what had “situationally changed” and prompted the decision to “take him at that point.” Fleming said everything changed once his partner said Richards might have a gun. “I perceived that his intentions were lethal,” Fleming said. But his answers suggested that he hadn’t fully grasped Richards’s mental state. “Why would any sane person hide a fake gun?” Fleming asked. When the investigators asked why the two officers did not broadcast that Richards was an “E.D.P.” — or an emotionally disturbed person — with a knife, as protocol dictates, Murphy told them he and Fleming had handled people in crisis before. Asked why they made the decision to use force, Murphy simply said, “We wanted to, like, end it.” While the Force Investigation Division ultimately concluded that the officers had been “justified” in shooting — because they were facing an “individual armed with a knife and an imitation firearm” — the investigators also said that Fleming and Murphy should still be punished. Richards, their September 2018 internal report noted, “was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.” And the officers violated policy by not asking permission from their supervisor before they acted. The department’s full investigative record was first reported by the independent journalist Michael Hayes in his 2023 book, “The Secret Files.” The review recommended that the officers face disciplinary charges that could ultimately result in their firing. But in New York, as in almost all cities in the United States, the police commissioner has absolute power over punishment. In March 2019, O’Neill, who had extolled the promise of body cameras just two years earlier, overruled his own investigators. He decided that neither Fleming nor Murphy would be punished for killing Richards. Instead, the commissioner docked them three vacation days for something else they did: stopping for pizza before responding to the call for the wellness check. (O’Neill did not respond to questions or requests for comment.) It would be another three months before anyone outside the department would see the full footage. That June, a New York judge ruled that the “public is vested with an inherent right to know” and ordered the department to turn over the recordings to Lowenkron’s organization. She received a package with a DVD a month later from the department. Bracing herself, she sat down to view it on her computer. The footage that the department publicly released cut off when the officers fired. Lowenkron now saw the aftermath: Richards collapsed to the floor, crumpled and bleeding in the same spot where he had been standing rigidly seconds before. “He’s still alive,” Fleming said. “Holy shit,” Murphy replied. “Just fucking cuff him.” The officers then flipped over Richards, severely injured, so roughly that his head could be heard bouncing off the floor. They searched around the room for the firearm they thought Richards had. Eventually, Fleming found a palm-size, silver-colored plastic toy gun. “It’s some fucking little thing,” he said. (The video does not show Richards holding the toy gun.) More than three minutes passed before anyone administered any type of aid to the dying man. It was an Emergency Services Unit specialist who retrieved medical equipment after hearing the shots. Outside the apartment building, more video recorded other officers milling about. One told a colleague, “They were just hurling fucking shots.” The N.Y.P.D. initially withheld the footage of the aftermath of the Miguel Richards shooting. Below are clips from the videos that a state judge later ordered released. They contain graphic content. As the officers move into Miguel Richards’s room moments after shooting him, Fleming observes, “He’s still alive.” Officer Murphy is breathing heavily. “Holy shit,” he says. The officers ask one another if they are all right as they mill around Richards’s injured body. He is handcuffed and flipped over so roughly his head can be heard bouncing heavily on the floor. As more officers arrive outside Richards’s apartment building, one tells a colleague, “They were just hurling fucking shots.” Lowenkron was shocked. Officers had shot a young man and roughly handled him as he bled to death. “The utter disrespect,” Lowenkron says. “It was a horror movie.” New York Lawyers for the Public Interest would go on to share the footage with journalists. It would also use the footage in a webinar for mental-health advocates in November 2020. “The point,” Lowenkron told me, “was to get more people engaged on this issue: transforming New York and this country’s response to people in crisis.” But by then, for another man in distress, it was too late. In April 2019, one month after O’Neill decided against punishing the officers for the Richards shooting, another officer shot and killed a man named Kawaski Trawick. The circumstances were remarkably similar to those in the Richards case. Trawick was also a young Black man who lived in the Bronx and was experiencing a mental-health crisis in his own apartment. He was also holding a knife when the police arrived. And he was also shot soon afterward. At the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Napolitano was immediately struck by the parallels: “I remember reading the headline on Trawick and thinking, Didn’t I read this already?” This time, though, the victim’s family filed a complaint with the review board, providing an opening for civilian investigators to use body-worn-camera footage to make a case that the department and others couldn’t ignore. But despite repeated requests over many months, the department wouldn’t share the footage — or any other records — with the review board, leaving the oversight agency effectively unable to begin its own investigation of the case. The refusal was in line with the department’s longstanding practice to withhold footage from the board until the department’s internal investigation was over, a process that often takes more than a year. Such delays can effectively torpedo the review board’s investigations: Under New York civil-service law, any disciplinary cases against police officers must be brought within 18 months of the incident. In the Trawick case, the review board obtained the full body-camera video in January 2021 — more than a year and a half after the killing — and only after a state judge ordered the department to hand it over to Lowenkron’s organization, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, which had sued for it. The judge determined that the department had been withholding the footage “in bad faith.” What it showed was even more damning than what was captured in the Richards shooting. As the police entered his apartment, Trawick demanded to know, “Why are you in my home?” One officer, Herbert Davis, who was Black and more experienced, then tried to stop his white junior counterpart, Brendan Thompson, from using force. “We ain’t gonna tase him,” Davis said in the video. Thompson didn’t listen. Instead, he fired his Taser at Trawick, sending roughly 50,000 volts pulsing through him. As Trawick started rushing toward the officers, Thompson lifted his gun and prepared to fire. “No, no — don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t,” Davis said, pushing his partner’s arm down. But Thompson fired four shots, hitting Trawick twice and killing him almost instantly, 112 seconds after they arrived at the apartment. (Davis and Thompson did not reply to requests for comment.) There was also troubling footage of the aftermath of the shooting. Officers swarmed outside Trawick’s apartment. “Who’s injured?” a sergeant asked. Two officers replied in near unison: “Nobody. Just a perp.” With all that in hand, the review board completed its investigation in June 2021. The agency, through one of the few powers it had gained over the years, can file and prosecute disciplinary cases against officers — which triggers a Police Department trial, after which a departmental judge sends a provisional decision to the police commissioner, who makes the final call. This September, the police judge overseeing the Trawick case recommended that there should be no discipline. Her reason had nothing to do with the shooting itself; in fact, the judge wrote that she had “serious doubts” about the decisions of the officer who killed Trawick. But the review board, she said, had failed to file charges within the 18-month statute of limitations, as outlined under state law. In the end, the department’s refusal to give the footage to the review board had effectively run out the clock on any chance the officers would be punished. “That should not be tolerated,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “Both C.C.R.B. and N.Y.P.D. are city agencies. This is something the mayor needs to resolve.” In the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, huge demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality rolled across the country and the world. It was a global reckoning brought on by footage — the video, recorded by a teenager on her smartphone for more than eight minutes, showing Derek Chauvin ending Floyd’s life. Napolitano and her team at the review board had collected data showing how footage could make a difference in New York too. Access to body-camera footage roughly doubled the likelihood that agency investigators would be able to decide a case on its merits rather than dismiss it as inconclusive. But the backlog was growing. That May, the board filed 212 requests with the Police Department for body-worn-camera footage — and the department sent only 33 responses. (While the pandemic slowed the work of all city agencies, the backlog predated it.) “The withholding of footage stops investigations and prevents the C.C.R.B. from providing adequate and meaningful oversight of the N.Y.P.D.,” an internal agency memo warned. “The situation for New York City oversight of the police has steadily grown worse during the duration of a B.W.C. program intended primarily to aid oversight.” ‘We just said to police departments: “Here’s this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.” It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re going to use it in a way that most benefits them.’ Napolitano campaigned internally for a law that would take away the department’s absolute control over footage and give the review board its own access. That November, she was let go, along with three other staff members who had sent pointed emails and memos about the department’s withholding of footage. The four filed a lawsuit claiming that their firing violated their First Amendment rights and received an undisclosed settlement. A review-board spokeswoman wrote in an email that the agency has “publicly and repeatedly called on legislators to support the fight for direct access. No employee has ever been fired for supporting direct access to B.W.C. footage.” This spring, the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, and the New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams, sponsored a bill that would give the review board direct access to footage so that it wouldn’t be beholden to the department for cooperation during investigations. “There are difficult split-second decisions that have to happen” in policing, Williams told me. “But if we’re not able to look at the same thing, if we have to take the word of the N.Y.P.D., that doesn’t make this conversation any easier.” The Police Department has opposed the bill. A department official insisted at a City Council hearing in March that the department “does not fear transparency.” But the official argued that it would be an “insurmountable obstacle” to give the review board direct access while following state confidentiality laws. The bill has been stalled for months. The city, meanwhile, paid out at least $121 million in settlements last year for lawsuits alleging misconduct by police officers — the highest total in five years. With footage remaining in the control of the Police Department, body-worn cameras have made little difference to the public. This year, a federal court monitor wrote a scathing report about persistent problems with stop-and-frisk, the unconstitutional policing tactic that prompted Judge Scheindlin to order the department to adopt body cameras a decade ago. The monitor found that contrary to Scheindlin’s expectations, police supervisors weren’t using footage to flag misconduct. In a sample of cases the monitor looked at, supervisors reviewing footage of stop-and-frisk encounters concluded that 100 percent of the cases they looked at were proper stops. The court monitor reviewed the same footage and found that 37 percent of the stops were unconstitutional. “It was an experiment,” Scheindlin says, one that didn’t anticipate issues like control over footage. Scheindlin, who stepped down from the bench in 2016, says she now believes that the Police Department should no longer be the sole custodian of its own video. “That troubles me,” she says. “It should always be somebody independent.” In interviews with a half dozen former commanders and high-level officials, most of whom were involved in the body-camera program itself, they said that despite its public pronouncements, the department hasn’t committed to using footage for accountability. “Body cams are essential, if done right,” says a high-ranking commander who just retired and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in law enforcement. “They are a game changer.” He added: “If there’s a problem, you flag — and potentially there’s discipline. But that’s not happening in most cases.” Instead, he says, body cameras have become “an exercise in just work they have to do. It’s a culture thing.” Rudy Hall has a particularly useful vantage point. He was part of the team that rolled out the body cameras, visiting police departments around the country to see how they were using the technology, and has gone on to work for the federal monitor overseeing the department’s compliance with Scheindlin’s now-decade-old order on stop-and-frisk. “I watch a lot of body-cam videos,” Hall told me. “I have absolutely seen supervisors approve problematic conduct.” “Body-worn cameras have not been exploited the way they should be,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early-warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes. But there weren’t a lot of discussions about it. The N.Y.P.D. needs to do a lot better.” One of the most comprehensive studies of the use of body cameras, a 2019 meta-analysis led by researchers at George Mason University, recommended that police departments consider using footage the way sports teams use game tape, to regularly review and improve performance. That’s essentially what the New Orleans Police Department did after the U.S. Department of Justice put it under federal oversight about a decade ago in response to the police killings of several Black men and persistent police violence. Body cameras were a “critical engine for us to continuously evaluate performance,” says Danny Murphy, who ran a unit at the department overseeing compliance with the federal mandate. Four auditors were hired to join the police force and comb through footage. They looked to make sure that officers were using their cameras and that supervisors were flagging any problematic behavior. “If officers know they’re being viewed, if supervisors know they’re being reviewed, it creates a pressure for accountability,” says Murphy, who left the department four years ago. A 2020 report from the city’s civilian oversight agency — which has direct access to footage — noted a reduction in both the use of force and citizen complaints, which the department attributed to “the use of the body-worn cameras and the increased scrutiny and oversight these cameras provide leadership.” The police in New Orleans also regularly and quickly release video from shootings and other major incidents. But in the end, it’s the police chief who has the final say on discipline. During his tenure at the New York Police Department, Schlanger had, in fact, started a kind of internal oversight system similar to the one in New Orleans. Schlanger and other senior officials would meet with each of the department’s 77 precincts every six months and look at body-camera footage to identify problematic trends and officers. “It was CompStat for constitutional policing,” Schlanger says, referring to the department’s data-heavy program for tracking crime. “If we saw a precinct doing poorly, we’d work to help them. It made a difference.” The department quietly ended the review program last year. A civil suit on behalf of Miguel Richards’s estate was filed against the city in 2018. New York is seeking the dismissal of the case. A judge has been considering the request for two and a half years. “I want answers,” his mother told me, “and haven’t been able to get them.” The three officers involved in the Richards shooting were honored in 2018 by the largest New York police union, the Police Benevolent Association, which gave them its Finest of the Finest award for “extremely brave and tactically sound action” in the Richards shooting, noting that “the officers had no choice but to open fire.” The officers were later deposed in the lawsuit. One of them, Mark Fleming, said in his testimony in September 2020 that he had learned a lesson: that the Emergency Services Unit — whose help he told department investigators he didn’t need — is in fact better equipped and trained to deal with situations that involve people having a mental-health crisis. It’s not clear what, if any, lessons the department itself has taken in. Since Richards’s death in 2017, when cameras were widely rolled out, officers have killed at least 11 people in crisis. There is no evidence that officers have been punished in any of the cases. On a Sunday morning in the Bronx this spring, there was another shooting. Santo de la Cruz called a city emergency line. His son, 42-year-old Raul de la Cruz, was in the middle of a schizophrenic episode and had posted a disturbing video on Facebook that morning. Wearing camouflage clothing and a hat with a patch of an Israeli flag, Raul complained about racist police officers. His father called 311, avoiding 911 because he was afraid of what would happen if the police showed up. “I thought they would send someone capable of dealing with a situation like that,” he says in Spanish. “Because I was calling for a sick person, not to send the police to shoot him up.” But it was the police who arrived, with body cameras rolling. And Raul was holding a knife. The officers shot him 28 seconds after arriving. He was hospitalized for more than a month before being released, having lost a kidney and part of his liver. A department commander cited the body-camera footage when he gave a brief news conference the day of the shooting to describe what happened. “This situation was fast, volatile and dangerous,” he said. The officers’ “quick response saved at least one civilian and protected themselves.” But the department has not released the footage or commented in the eight months since. Lowenkron’s colleagues at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest have once again requested the video, so far to no avail. The department has also withheld the footage from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, per the practice of sharing records with the agency only after its own investigation is done. On Dec. 5, weeks after we sent questions to the department about that practice, the department signed a memorandum of understanding with the board to send footage to it within 90 days of a request. But for now, nobody outside the department knows exactly what happened in the de la Cruz shooting, including the family. They have not heard anything from the department. They want to see the footage. This article is a partnership between ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine. Additional reporting by Umar Farooq.

2023-12-11,"An armed woman who was allegedly threatening to shoot a young child was shot and killed by police during an incident in San Bernardino on Dec. 10, according to the San Bernardino Police Department. The child was not physically harmed during the incident, and no officers were injured. The San Bernardino P.D. gave this account of the incident: At about 8 a.m., officers responded to a call in the 200 block of East 21st Street of a subject armed with a handgun. According to a very distraught caller, there was a woman inside the residence with a gun to the head of her 3-year-old grandson. When officers arrived, the female suspect walked onto a balcony of the apartment and allegedly pointed a gun at one of the officers, who had just met the reporting party outside. The suspect retreated into the apartment where the young child was still located and locked the door. The reporting party was hysterical as she explained that the female suspect had already shot off the gun inside the residence and stated the baby was not safe with the suspect inside. Due to the suspect barricading herself with the child inside, the officers had to kick open the door. When the first officer kicked the door open, he saw the suspect standing on a bed inside the living room with a gun pointed directly at the young child, who was seated on the bed right below her. The child was crying and was in immediate danger of being shot at that moment. The officer fired several rounds at the suspect. The suspect was wounded, but she kept the gun in her hand. The officer ordered her to drop the firearm; however, she pointed her gun back at the child once more. The officer fired his weapon again to stop the suspect and attempt to save the childâs life. Officers immediately ran and grabbed the baby to get it away from harm. The child was not injured and was returned to family members outside the apartment. Medical aid was rendered to the suspect, but she succumbed to her injuries at the residence. The suspect was identified as Darvet Brown, a 35-year-old resident of San Bernardino. She was not related to the child, and the motive for her behavior is not fully understood at this time. This investigation is still ongoing. Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact Detective Chavez at Chavez_ed@sbcity.org.",Armed woman who was allegedly threatening to shoot young child is shot to death by police,Y
2023-12-10,"INDIANAPOLIS — For the 18th time this year, an IMPD officer has fired a weapon in self-defense or to protect someone else. This time, no one was wounded by gunfire. It was around midnight when several IMPD officers tried to clear a parking lot in the 2800 block of Lafayette Road, where several vehicles were driving recklessly and performing burn outs. ”While formulating a plan, at least one officer verbally informed dispatch that multiple shots were being fired in the area,” said Patrolman William Young. “They had already identified one vehicle for reckless driving, criminal recklessness. They engaged that vehicle, and it refused to stop for those officers and a short pursuit ensued that brought us here, where they rammed an occupied patrol vehicle, which in turn, the suspect took off and struck another vehicle.” Police said that, when the driver drove into a dead end parking lot near Cardinal Ritter High School, he pulled a U turn, and that’s where the police vehicle was rammed head-on with an officer inside and then took aim at two more officers. “A second officer engaged the vehicle leading to an officer involved shooting” said Young. “The vehicle continued to travel back southbound at a high rate of speed refusing to stop leading officers to West 30th street at Tibbs Avenue, striking another uninvolved vehicle at the intersection coming to a stop.” Officers took the 23-year-old driver into custody and called an ambulance for his female passenger. In an email sent Sunday evening, IMPD announced that Sebastian Jiminez was arrested for his alleged role in the incident. Jiminez has been preliminarily charged with battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness and reckless driving. ”Neither the suspect driver nor the passenger was shot by the officers,” said Young. Two officers were treated for minor crash injuries. At least twice in the past month, police say they have been targeted by drivers.

Out on bond and awaiting trial, Leachman was involved in another IMPD ramming incident on Indy’s south side in early November. Just before Thanksgiving, Antonio Berry was arrested after police say he smashed three of their vehicles at 75th and Shadeland one night as officers tried to arrest him for brandishing a gun outside of a bar and threatening to kill a bartender. This morning’s driver faces charges of Recklessness with a Deadly Weapon and Resisting with a Motor Vehicle. ”Absolutely, a truck can be considered a deadly force situation,” IMPD Lt. Shane Foley said after a previous incident. “We’ve seen earlier this year people have been killed with people using vehicles as weapons. We’ve seen earlier this year where people have used these weapons against our officers and it’s resulted in injury.” The driver from the Sunday morning incident is at the Adult Detention Center awaiting an initial hearing.",Fleeing driver and crashes result in police gunfire in Indianapolis,N
2023-12-09,"Three officers have been fired and one suspended without pay after a Black man was shot by police while his vehicle was being repossessed outside his home is Alabama, CNN reports. Stephen Perkins, 39, was fatally shot on September 29 after officials said he “brandished a handgun” with a light “towards an officer with the Decatur Police Department,” according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. On Thursday (December 7), Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion announced that the city’s major decided to fire three officers and suspend one following a hearing that determined the officers violated policy. Decatur police were initially called to Perkins’ home after he allegedly pulled a handgun on a tow truck driver as he was attempting to repossess a vehicle at the 39-year-old’s home. Officers arrived at the scene with the tow truck driver, which is when Perkins “exited the residence armed with a handgun and began to threaten the tow truck driver,” according to police. “Officers on scene ordered the homeowner to drop his weapon, which he refused to do. It was at this time the homeowner turned the gun towards one of the Officers on scene. The Officer discharged his duty weapon, striking the subject,” Decatur police claimed. The police chief later said the officer didn’t order Perkins to drop a weapon. “We now know the officer identified themselves as ‘police’ and ordered Mr. Perkins to ‘get on the ground’ prior to the officer firing rather than ordering him to drop the weapon at that time as we initially reported the morning of the shooting,” Pinion said in a statement. “That means that we also erred in stating Mr. Perkins ‘refused’ to drop his firearm prior to the shooting. I apologize for the inaccurate description of the encounter in our initial statement.” Perkins’ family argued that the 39-year-old didn’t owe money on his car, citing that they had “found financial receipts proving” he wasn’t at risk of “being in an active status of repossession” and that “monthly payments were processed through his financing company.” “The Towing Company and City of Decatur Police Department wrongfully appeared at (his) home,” the family said in a statement. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is still investigating the incident independent of the probe completed by Decatur police. The Black Information Network is your source for Black News!

2023-12-14,"A 33-year-old man died Wednesday night in a police-involved shooting, according to Oakland County Sheriff’s officials. Deputies from the sheriff’s Pontiac substation were patrolling the neighborhood at North Astor Street and North Pike Street at 9 p.m. Wednesday when they spotted a silver 4-door sedan suspected of being involved in a shots-fired incident at the Carriage Circle Apartment Complex over the weekend. Deputies made a traffic stop on the vehicle and approached the male motorist for questioning. He sped off, according to police. Deputies pursued the sedan while alerting other officers they were chasing a fleeing suspect. Police were able to stop the vehicle near Westway and Benson streets, a neighborhood on the city’s east side, just south of M-59. When the driver got out of the sedan, according to police, he abruptly turned toward deputies in what was described as a “two-handed posture.” Deputies fired on the suspect and then called EMS to the scene to treat the man, whose name has not been released. The man was declared dead at McLaren Oakland Hospital.’ The shooting happened in City Council President Mike McGuinness’ district. He said he expected residents to talk about this incident at next week’s council meeting. He said he was alerted to the shooting late Wednesday and spent much of Thursday morning talking to police about it. “Any loss of life is tragic and unnecessary and first I want to express my remorse for the breaking news that a man has died,” he said. “Because this is a shooting involving sheriff’s deputies, the city council will be eager to learn more about the particulars of the incident and make sure as much as possible is shared with the public.” The incident is currently being investigated by the Oakland County Sheriff’s special-investigations unit.

2023-12-07,"By Trice Edney Wire (TriceEdneyWire.com) – Cops who killed an unarmed 25-year-old Black man, Jayland Walker, by shooting him 43 times last June in Akron, Ohio, did not violate the law, even after the medical examiner’s office ruled the murder was a homicide. Steve Mylett, the Akron chief of police, found that the officerâs actions during the fatal encounter were âobjectively reasonable.â His ruling came on November 29, more than a year after Jaylan Walker was gunned down by police during a traffic stop on June 27, 2002. The decision to clear the cops was already signed, sealed, and delivered to the anger of some. On April 17, 2023, a special grand jury in Ohio declined to indict the Akron police officers after a car chase and foot chase last year. The grand jury concluded the officers were legally justified in their use of force against Jayland Walker, according to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. Following the shooting, Walker was put in handcuffs by police and was found with his hands cuffed behind his back when EMTs arrived on the scene. According to police, officers attempted to administer first aid to Walker after he was shot many times. Walker was pronounced dead at the scene. Police shot Walker 17 times in his pelvis. One bullet struck his face and fractured his jaw. Eight gunshot wounds injured his arms and his right hand. Five gunshot wounds injured his knees, right lower leg, and right foot, according to Lisa Kohler, MD, the Summit County Medical Examiner. No firearm was found on or near Walker’s body, though the cops on the scene all claimed that they saw him reach for a weapon or for what they assumed was a weapon. No illegal drugs were found in his body. The Summit County Medical Examinerâs Office ruled his death a homicide seven months after the deadly shooting. Eight cops, including a Black officer, fired 94 shots within 6.7 seconds at Jayland Walker. Three cops fired 18 shots each. But the deadly shootings complied with the departmentâs rules, said Police Chief Mylott. Walker worked as a delivery driver when police stopped him for a traffic violation because his license plate was broken. Gun residue shows he did not have a gun in his hands. A gun was found in his car near his wedding ring. The Summit County Medical Examinerâs Office ruled his death a homicide. Police killings over minor traffic violations has become routine by cops. Police often argue that low-level stops and the searches they conduct during those stops allow them to root out dangerous crimes by identifying guns and drugs. However, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, data shows that searches that begin with traffic stops seldom yield contraband. Encounters with police during traffic stops, including minor infractions, disproportionately harm people of color, according to data collected by Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research group, which argues that armed police should not be involved in the majority of these cases. Community organizations want the U.S. Justice Department to investigate Walker’s murder. Walkerâs family has filed a $45 million lawsuit against the city of Akron and the police department.

2023-12-01,"INDIANAPOLIS — Thursday night saw the 17th time an IMPD officer shot a citizen in 2023. It’s the most such incidents since 2015 when there were 20 officer-involved shootings and 10 fatalities. Since Aug. 1, there have been 13 officer-involved shootings, with nine of the shootings resulting in fatalities. Each officer-involved shooting opens up multiple investigations and processes that go through different IMPD leadership, boards and community groups. ”This investigation is being led by the Critical Incident Response Team,” said IMPD Asst. Chief Chris Bailey, at the scene of the shooting Thursday night. “A parallel administrative investigation will be conducted by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Dept. Internal Affairs Unit.” Once the criminal investigation finishes, the Civilian Majority Use of Force Board will review both investigations. FOX59/CBS4 spoke with IMPD Dep. Chief Catherine Cummings about how the board operates in October. “The board takes whatever particular use of force incident we are presenting to them,” Cummings said. “They go through the hours or day-long hearing. They hear from the people involved, they hear from the experts.” Once the hearing is complete, the board provides its recommendation to Chief Taylor. “The board provides their recommendation to the Chief,” Cummings said. “Whether they feel that the actions were in policy or out of policy and then the Chief takes that into consideration when he’s making his final determination.” The board is made up of four members from IMPD and five civilian members. Two are appointed by Chief Taylor and three are appointed by the City-County Council. In the days after the shooting, IMPD pays the company Critical Incident Videos $6,000 to create a critical incident video of the incident. IMPD passes along body camera video, 911 calls, security camera video and more resources from the scene. FOX59/CBS4 spoke with IMPD Lt. Shane Foley about the process that goes into every critical incident video. ”We do that because we find it’s important that we have that third-party vendor that’s producing the video and doing it independently from the work that were doing,” Foley said. Once IMPD gets the video back, it’s watched by leadership that does have the ability to make changes if they feel there are inaccuracies. Before the video is released, it’s shown to the officer or officers involved and the person shot or family of the person shot. The video is also watched by a community group. Foley said it is made up of more than 50 members of the community, some from each IMPD district. “They let us know what type of content they want to see, if it meets their expectations for what they want shared and it helps them process and gain a better understanding of what’s taking place during these incidents,” Foley said. Of the 17 officer-involved shootings, nine videos have been released, two have been court-ordered to not be released and another is an ISP investigation. IMPD will not release that video until ISP concludes its investigation. That leaves five videos that have not been released yet, including the most recent. According to IMPD data, the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office has only made charging decisions for officers involved in two of the shootings. Charges in the 15 other incidents are still pending.",Another investigation underway following latest IMPD police shooting,N*

2023-12-07,"A teen driver on a suicide run was shot and wounded by police after crashing his car and flashing a gun at officers in Upper Manhattan early Thursday, NYPD officials said. The 19-year-old man, who had a young woman as a passenger, got into an accident on the service road of the Henry Hudson Parkway just before 3 a.m., NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell told reporters.Â Police responded, with one officer approaching the front passenger side of the car and the other walking up to the driver’s side. That’s when the driver “jumps out of the car in possession of a firearm,â Chell said. âOur officers defend themselves [and] have to discharge their firearms, strike the perp two times in the chest area.â The man was taken to a local hospital, where he was admitted for surgery and was expected to survive, Chell said.Â Inside the car — which may have been stolen — authorities found a handwritten suicide note that included an apology to the cops whom the disturbed driver expected to confront him, the police official said.Â âRight now, inside that vehicle, we do have a note indicating that the individual wanted to commit suicide — various things were going on [in] his life,â Chell said. âBut he also apologized to our cops for what was about to happen.â Two uniformed officers opened fire during the ordeal, and about eight rounds were fired, cops said.Â The woman who was inside the car with the teen was taken to a local precinct stationhouse, and has âgiven us some insight as to what happened here,â Chell said.Â âThe second time in four days, our cops respond to help people from their community, and are met with an immediate attack and they have to defend themselves,â the police official said, referring to another police shooting early Sunday in Queens. In that incident, an unhinged man, Courtney Gordon, 38, used a steak knife to butcher four of his relatives â including an 11-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy â and set their home ablaze before he injured two police officers and was shot dead by responding cops.

2023-12-04,"ST. CHARLES COUNTY â O'Fallon police on Sunday shot and killed a man they say fired shots at a clock tower outside the O'Fallon, Missouri, City Hall, led officers on a chase, then pointed a shotgun at them and exchanged gunfire.Â Douglas Alan Phipps, 34, was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting in the Royal Oaks subdivision of St. Charles County. The neighborhood is about 3 miles north of city hall.Â Phipps pointed a shotgun at officers after stepping out of his vehicle after stopping at a cul-de-sac on Spring Court, O'Fallon Sgt. Bryan Harr said in a news release. Officers then shot at Phipps, who returned fire before he was killed by officers.Â Harr said the two officers are a 47-year-old officer with 24 years of experience and a 28-year-old officer with five years of experience. Neither officer was injured.Â People are also reading… The incident began at about 4:15 p.m. Sunday when police received reports that someone was firing shots at the clock tower near City Hall on North Main Street, Harr said. The suspect was described as a white man driving a maroon car.Â Police tried to stop the car at the intersection of Main Street and Highway P, about a mile north of City Hall. The vehicle did not stop, and police pursued it west down Highway P and into the Royal Oaks subdivision.Â Surveillance video from a homeowner captured the pursuit when it turned off Highway P and into the subdivision. In the video, sirens can be heard before a red sedan enters the subdivision at a slow speed, followed closely by four police vehicles with lights and sirens activated.Â Ten more O'Fallon and St. Charles County police vehicles drove into the subdivision as the suspect led police on a slow drive looping through the neighborhood, said Keith Barker, who took the video from his home near Royal Oaks and Fawn Ridge drives. The video was taken at about 4:26 p.m., but a time stamp on the video is an hour ahead, Barker said.Â Police placed spike strips at Highway P and Royal Oaks, one of the entrances to the neighborhood, but Phipps instead turned the opposite direction on Royal Oaks and accelerated farther into the neighborhood and out of sight, Barker said. Barker, who has lived in the neighborhood for 24 years, said he didn't recognize Phipps. He often hears sirens on Highway P, but they're usually ambulances or firetrucks, he said. ""To hear sirens and then see this unusually slow pursuit was very unusual,"" Barker said. ""It was nothing like you would see on TV. ""This is going to be talked about in our subdivision for quite a long time."" The clock tower had visible damage on Monday.Â Sunday's shooting was the thirdÂ fatal police shooting in O'Fallon since January 2019, when an officer shot and killed an armed 64-year-old man during a mental health checkÂ at the man's home. OâFallon police said at the time that the officer feared for his and a mental health worker's life. The man's family sued the police department in August of this year claiming wrongful death. And in January 2022, police officers shot and killed a teen in a car on a cul-de-sac while responding to a call for a ""suspicious vehicle."" Police said they loudly knocked on the car window and spotted a handgun in the front seat before the driver reversed the car into a police vehicle and tried to drive off. The teen's family said he and a friend were sleeping in the car after visiting another friend in the area. The St. Charles County Prosecutor's office later declined to press charges against the officers, releasing video of the incident and saying the officers believed their lives were at risk.Â The incident Sunday is being investigated by the county'sÂ Critical Incident Response team, a group formed in 2022 that includes lieutenant commanders and detectives from the St. Charles County, Cottleville, Lake St. Louis, OâFallon, St. Charles, St. Peters and Wentzville police departments. The investigators eventually turn over their findings to the St. Charles County prosecutor. Phipps' family could not be reached Monday. O'Fallon police released a mugshot of Phipps but did not provide information about whether he was previously known to the department. Court records show Phipps had a lengthy criminal history in St. Charles, Lincoln and Warren counties including domestic assault, burglary, theft, trespassing and driving while intoxicated. Phipps also had several restraining orders filed against him, including two in 2022.Â The shooting in O'Fallon happened hours before a man wasÂ killed by a police officer in Lake St. LouisÂ after a struggle over a gun. In that case, police said they were investigating a report of a shooting when a man walked toward them with two handguns and fought with police when they tried to disarm him.Â Kim Bell of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.Â","Police kill gunman in shootout after pursuit from O'Fallon, Mo., City Hall",Y

2023-12-04,"INDIAN RIVER COUNTY, Fla. â The injury of a deputy from an unintended discharge of a firearm prompted the Indian River County Sheriff's Office to switch the type of weapon they issue to members of their agency. Indian River County Sheriff Eric Flowers held a news conference Monday afternoon to discuss the incident, which occurred July 14. Region Indian River County Indian River County Sheriff's Office deputy shot himself after gun not fixed The sheriff said Deputy Zachary Seldes was coming in for a training class and took off his vest. As he did, Flowers said the deputy's Sig P320 discharged inside of the holster, striking Seldes in the calf. The bullet traveled down the deputy's leg and became lodged just before his ankle. Other deputies at the scene began rendering aid and took him to the hospital, which eventually required ""a couple of surgeries,"" the sheriff said. Flowers said a similar incident occurred shortly afterward in Connecticut, and he became aware that other law enforcement agencies had stopped using the weapon because of similar fears, including Pasco County, Florida. ""From Connecticut, you'll see in the video, the officer is inside the police department. He leans forward. The gun goes off in the holster,"" Flowers said. ""There's no hands anywhere near it. There's nobody touching it. That's a grave concern to me."" After the unintended discharge of the firearm, the sheriff said they looked at multiple vendors to replace the use of the SIG Sauer P320. Flowers said they settled on using the FN 509, which is also used by the Los Angeles Police Department. All deputies who serve the Indian River County Sheriff's Office are now carrying the firearm, and Flowers said they are ""very happy"" using the new gun. ""We hope that being here today that other law enforcement leaders will think about this,"" Flowers said. ""I've gone to the Florida Sheriff's Association. I've told my fellow sheriffs if you're carrying this Sig weapon, it's a huge liability for your agency.""

Chief of Patrol John Chell noted this was the second time in four days officers responding to a 911 call for assistance found themselves “under some sort of attack, and had to defend themselves.”Â However, in this instance, Chell revealed the suspect may have been on a mission to end his own life. âInside that vehicle, we do have a note indicating that the individual wanted to commit suicide for various things going on his life, but he also apologized to our cops for what was about to happen,â Chief Chell said. According to Chief Chell, two cops rushed to West 177th Street and Haven Avenue at around 2:55 a.m. on Dec. 7 after police received multiple 911 calls of an apparent vehicle collision. As the two responding officers got closer to an involved vehicle, they saw two people inside. âOne officer approaches the passenger side where there is a female, a second officer approaches the driver’s side, where immediately upon approaching that car, the door opens up,â Chell said. At that moment, Chell noted, a 19-year-old man wearing a ski mask and brandishing a gun leapt out of the vehicle and ran at the cops. That led the officers to pull out their service weapons and fire about eight shots â two of which struck the man in the chest.

2023-12-06,"Our communities are shaken by the death of Cortez Police Sgt. Michael Moran on Nov. 29, after being shot during a traffic stop on South Broadway across from Handy Mart in southwest Cortez. Moran isn’t from Cortez but he adopted the Southwest as his home, showing his love for it and its communities in how he did his job, how he was with people. Moran left behind two daughters, many friends and family members. A lot of memories have been shared in recent days of his dedication, passion for what he believed in and his sense of humor, especially in unexpected moments. Known for being calm in tense situations that could quickly accelerate, Moran would sometimes give fellow police officers a goofy grin during serious moments. A light reminder that the officers could manage whatever was at hand. They could keep themselves – and everyone else – safe. As reported in The Journal and The Durango Herald, Moran, 46, served as a Marine for nine years, including two tours in Iraq, before joining the Cortez Police Department in 2012. He rose through the ranks to become a canine handler in 2016. Otto became Moran’s beloved companion, serving by his side until the dog retired in 2020. Otto has since died, but while on duty with Moran, the team grew a sizable fan base after visiting schools and giving presentations about how they worked together. Moran and Otto were always a hit. We have much reverence for this man who served his community and country in uniform. And we’re made aware, once again, how dangerous jobs in law enforcement are during routine traffic stops. Moran’s death is the first of a Cortez police officer in the line of duty since Dale Claxton, who was killed in 1998, when he stopped a stolen water truck. On Saturday, Cortez’s holiday Parade of Lights ended with a tribute to Moran, with messages on cars, trucks and police vehicles to “Rest in Peace.” The procession of nearly six blocks ended with Moran’s car, draped in a black shroud, a somber contrast to the Christmas festivities and merry-making. The police department then fell into line, followed by a Fallen Heroes trailer. If you happen to believe in an afterlife with loved ones waiting, we imagine Otto there, greeting Moran with much tail wagging. Private funeral services for Moran will be held today at the Cortez Recreation Center, which is closed all day. The city is asking the public to stay away from the area. For information about viewing the services remotely, visit Colorado Fallen Hero Foundation at https://tinyurl.com/5yw9rwc8. We can’t, though, end our condolences just yet. It’s heartbreaking to learn about – and have seen – a video shot from across the road, immediately after the traffic stop, with Moran down on the street, dying of his injuries. The suspect is seen either picking up a magazine or expended shells, running off, then driving away with Moran left behind. Many in Cortez’s community have seen this video on social media. More shared it widely. What’s the value in this? None. If you have the video, please, delete it. If you see the video, insist it be taken down. It feels terribly disrespectful and it’s too painful for loved ones. If the video were sent directly to law enforcement to help track down the suspect, who died minutes later in a shootout with police, that’s one thing. A reason to film. But it remained online after the shooter was killed by police. This is what is most difficult and hurtful for loved ones of Moran. The video brings back sad memories for those close to Claxton, too. It’s intolerable, especially knowing that video made the rounds. An awful response after this tragedy. We in the Southwest share minimal degrees of separations among each other. Our communities are fairly small. Posting and sharing that video has unintended consequences. It’s also a sign of the times. Social media has desensitized us, taking away some social graces, some foresight into how it might feel for a family member to view that. If you have the video, stop and think what’s befitting to honor a slain police officer. Sharing that video is definitely not it.",Our View: Coming together in reverence for Sgt. Moran,N

However, during the encounter, a man in the car’s passenger seat fired a gun at one of the officers. The officer then responded with gunfire and hit the suspect. According to Richmond Police, the suspect managed to get away despite having been shot. Meanwhile, the three remaining suspects were taken into custody and four firearms were found at the scene. On the morning of Thursday, Dec. 7, an 18-year-old with a gunshot wound arrived at a local hospital and was identified as the fourth remaining suspect. He was treated and then arrested. The four suspects arrested and charged in connection to the Dec. 6 shooting are: - Devone Brown, 18, of Richmond: Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon - Corey Hewitt, 21, of Chesterfield County: Possession of a concealed weapon and possession of a firearm with an extended magazine - Kemonte Mayo, 18, of Henrico County: Outstanding Henrico County arrest warrants for strangulation, simple assault, and destruction of property - Calique Harris, 18, of Richmond: Attempted murder and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony in connection to the shooting Dana Schrad, the executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, said there has been an uptick in attacks on law enforcement officers. “We’ve had several [officers shot] in the Richmond central area,” Schrad said. “We’ve had an additional officer severely injured out in Roanoke recently.” Even though in this case, the suspect’s gunfire missed the officer, Schrad said first responders can’t dodge every bullet — and the effects of a violent shooting on one’s mental state can last longer than a gunshot wound. “One of the things that often happens is we hear a report that the officer is in stable condition and people go, ‘Oh, good, he’s fine,’ or ‘she’s fine!’ Schrad said. “When, in fact, there is a lot of trauma associated with any kind of officer injury, whether it’s trauma to the officer, to the family, to the officer’s fellow officers and to the agency as a whole.” In accordance with the Richmond Police Department’s policy, the officer involved in the shooting has been placed on paid administrative leave. This incident is still under investigation and anyone with information is asked to call Major Crimes Detective M.

2023-12-04,"The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) is currently investigating an officer-involved shooting that took place on Dec. 3 at a residence on Thorn Brook Circle in Bethlehem. A lieutenant and three deputies from the Barrow County Sheriffâs Office responded to a 911 call reporting a domestic disturbance. The caller, identified as the wife of the deceased, reported a verbal argument that had escalated into violence. The wife told dispatch that her husband, later identified as Robert Reynolds, Sr., 60, had a firearm. Upon arriving at the scene, officers knocked on the door and identified themselves. Simultaneously, the garage door began to open, and the deputies found themselves face-to-face with Reynolds, who was seated in a chair, holding a firearm in his lap. Reynolds grabbed the gun and pointed it at the officers while yelling at them. In response, three deputies discharged their weapons, resulting in Reynolds sustaining fatal injuries. Immediate aid was administered, but Reynolds succumbed to his injuries after being transported to a local hospital. Barrow County Sheriffâs Office has placed the three deputies involved in the shooting on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of the investigation. A stress management team has also been deployed to assist the deputies in coping with the aftermath of the incident. The GBI is actively investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and the case will be forwarded to the Piedmont Judicial Circuit for review upon completion. An autopsy on Reynolds will be conducted at the GBI crime lab as part of the ongoing investigation.

2023-12-04,"A man was shot and killed by deputies after pointing a gun at them at a home just outside of Decatur Sunday evening, according to the Wise County Sheriff’s Office. The incident began around 5:10 p.m. when the sheriff’s office received a call from a man requesting deputies be sent to his home on Single Tree Road southeast of Decatur, Wise County Sheriff Lane Akin said. Deputies have been called to the residence multiple times for domestic disturbance and assault reports, the sheriff added. “The caller refused to say why he wanted deputies to come to his house. He hung up, but called back and said, ‘Send the f***ing deputies,’” Akin said in a press release. When deputies arrived, they walked toward the front door, identified themselves as WCSO deputies and spoke to a man on his porch. After speaking to him briefly, the man reached toward his back waistband, and deputies backed away from the porch. The man was then seen holding a firearm in his right hand, and he went back inside the house before later coming back out to the porch. “He threatened to kill the deputies, and he pointed his weapon in the direction of the deputies,” Akin said in the press release. “Upon seeing the firearm pointed in the officers’ direction, deputies fired their weapons striking the man.” Officers administered first aid, and Wise County EMS — which had been staged nearby — also attended to the man, but they were unable to revive him. No officers were injured, Akin said. The deceased man’s identity is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. The Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting.

2023-12-08,"CHARLOTTE (QUEEN CITY NEWS) — Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police released body camera video Thursday from an August incident where an officer shot and killed a suspect in South End. The deadly encounter happened during a domestic call at a South End apartment complex. CMPD officials released more than 60 clips of body camera footage from all officers who responded to the scene that day on August 20, 2023, to an apartment on the third floor. Officers had received a frantic 911 call from a woman asking for Medic and police around 8 a.m. When CMPD officers arrived at the home with Medic, they knocked on the door, but there was no answer from inside. There were gunshots and officers then kicked down the door to get in. The first CMPD officer entered the bedroom where in the body cam video you can hear a woman screaming ‘help me.’ The suspect appears from behind a bookshelf with a gun. The CMPD officer is observed telling the suspect to put the gun down. The gun falls on the floor but the man then appears to be reaching toward it in the newly released video. The suspect is then seen physically lunging at the CMPD officer, knocking him to the floor. Another officer enters the room. He tries to push the suspect off the other officer. The suspect is observed with a knife in his hand and then proceeds to stab the second officer in the head. The CMPD officer who was under the suspect fired a single shot and struck the suspect. CMPD said two knives and two guns were recovered from the room. The suspect died from his injuries. CMPD Chief Johnny Jennings commended the quick actions of the CMPD officers saying in part, “They rose to their training, putting their lives in extreme danger for the sake of the protection of innocent life.” He went on to say, “Police officers are never able to predict the circumstances that they are about to encounter. This case highlights the dangers they face and how quickly a threat can present itself.” The CMPD officer who was stabbed in the head was able to make a full recovery.",Body cam video released of South End man who stabbed CMPD officer before fatally shot by police,N

2023-12-14,"In a recent verdict, 47-year-old Michael Dunn, a Farmers Branch police officer, has been found not guilty of murder in connection with the on-duty shooting death of 35-year-old Juan Moreno Jr. The incident occurred in 2019 when Dunn opened fire at a stolen pickup truck, killing Moreno in Northwest Dallas. The officer had reportedly followed a white pickup truck reported stolen from Irving. Dunn was exiting his cruiser as Moreno was pulling out of a parking lot. Farmers Branch police had been monitoring Moreno, suspected of stealing the pickup truck from Irving. During the trial, Dunn testified that he felt his life was in danger as Moreno was driving toward him while he exited his police vehicle. Police stated that officers were attempting to arrest Moreno for auto theft, but he ignored commands and tried to escape. Dunn opted for a judge to hear the trial, and on Wednesday, Judge Mike Snipes acquitted him after deliberating for less than half an hour. Dunn, who had been on administrative leave since the shooting, could have faced a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted. Farmers Branch Police Chief Kevin McCoy released the following statement on today's verdict in the Michael Dunn case: ""An officer-involved shooting is one of the most difficult situations faced by a police department, and any incident involving deadly force and the loss of life is tragic regardless of the circumstances. Our Department values every human life and works diligently to avoid using deadly force at all times. On behalf of the entire Farmers Branch Police Department, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Moreno family for the loss of their loved one on the evening of June 12, 2019. Now that Officer Dunn’s criminal trial has concluded, the Department’s Internal Affairs Division will move forward with a separate investigation regarding the same incident. Officer Dunn has been on administrative leave since the incident in 2019, and will remain on leave pending the outcome of the internal review process. The purpose in this and every investigation conducted by the Farmers Branch Police Department is to act with integrity and transparency in our constant effort to maintain the trust of the public we serve.""
