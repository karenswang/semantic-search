About Puerto Rico (from the CIA World Factbook) Area: 9,104 sq km Population: 3,057,311 (2023 est.) Capital: San Juan Other Facts The people of Puerto Rico are US citizens. They vote in US presidential primaries, but not in presidential elections. First named San Juan Bautista by Christopher Columbus. The governor is elected by popular vote with no term limits. Jenniffer GonzÃ¡lez has been the resident commissioner since January 3, 2017. The commissioner serves in the US House of Representatives, but has no vote, except in committees. Gonzalez is the first woman to hold this position. It is made up of 78 municipalities. Over 40% of the population lives in poverty, according to the Census Bureau. Puerto Ricans have voted in six referendums on the issue of statehood, in 1967, 1993, 1998, 2012, 2017 and 2020. The 2012 referendum was the first time the popular vote swung in statehoodâs favor. Since these votes were nonbinding, no action had to be taken, and none was. Ultimately, however, Congress must pass a law admitting them to the union. In addition to becoming a state, options for Puerto Ricoâs future status include remaining a commonwealth, entering âfree associationâ or becoming an independent nation. âFree associationâ is an official affiliation with the United States where Puerto Rico would still receive military assistance and funding.

October 3, 2017 – President Donald Trump visits. The trip comes after mounting frustration with the federal response to the storm. Many residents remain without power and continue to struggle to get access to food and fuel nearly two weeks after the storm hit. December 18, 2017 – Gov. Ricardo RossellÃ³ orders a review of deaths related to Hurricane Maria as the number could be much higher than the officially reported number. The announcement from the islandâs governor follows investigations from CNN and other news outlets that called into question the official death toll of 64. January 22, 2018 – RossellÃ³ announces that the commonwealth will begin privatizing the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. January 30, 2018 – More than four months after Maria battered Puerto Rico, the Federal Emergency Management Agency tells CNN it is halting new shipments of food and water to the island.

In a report to Congress, the commonwealthâs government says documents show that 1,427 more deaths occurred in the four months after Hurricane Maria than ânormal,â compared with deaths that occurred the previous four years. The 1,427 figure also appears in a report published July 9.

August 29, 2018 – Trump says the federal governmentâs response to the disaster was âfantastic.â He says problems with the islandâs aging infrastructure created challenges for rescue workers. September 4, 2018 – The US Government Accountability Office releases a report revealing that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was so overwhelmed with other storms by the time Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico that more than half of the workers it was deploying to disasters were known to be unqualified for the jobs they were doing in the field. September 13, 2018 – In a tweet, Trump denies that nearly 3,000 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. He expresses skepticism about the death toll, suggesting that individuals who died of other causes were included in the hurricane count. July 9, 2019 – Excerpts of profanity-laden, homophobic and misogynistic messages between RossellÃ³ and members of his inner circle are published by local media. July 10, 2019 – Six people, including Puerto Ricoâs former education secretary and a former health insurance official, are indicted on corruption charges.

August 7, 2019 – Puerto Ricoâs Justice Secretary Wanda VÃ¡zquez Garced is sworn in as the third governor Puerto Rico has had in less than a week. Earlier in the day, the August 2nd swearing-in of RossellÃ³âs handpicked successor, attorney Pedro Pierluisi, is thrown out by the Supreme Court, on grounds he has not been confirmed by both chambers of the legislature. September 27, 2019 – The federal control board that oversees Puerto Ricoâs finances releases a plan that would cut the islandâs debt by more than 60% and rescue it from bankruptcy. The plan targets bonds and other debt held by the government and will now go before a federal judge. The percentage of Puerto Ricoâs taxpayer funds spent on debt payments will fall to less than 9%, compared to almost 30% before the restructuring. December 28, 2019 – A sequence of earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or higher begin hitting Puerto Rico, including a 6.4 magnitude quake on January 7 that killed at least one man, destroyed homes and left most of the island without power.

According to Sterling Heights Lt. Mario Bastianelli, officers attempted to make a traffic stop Thursday at 11:15 p.m. on Carbon Drive south of 15 Mile Road on a Chrysler 300 with tinted windows driving without its headlights on. When officers approached the vehicle, the driver sped away, leading them on a pursuit though a nearby subdivision at speeds of 60 mph. The vehicle turned onto Forrer Court west of Amsterdam Drive, which is a dead-end street. “Officers attempted to approach the vehicle on foot as it was stopped in the court, and the vehicle attempted to flee, putting the officers in danger of being struck,” said Bastianelli. “One officer shot multiple rounds into the vehicle, striking the suspect.” The suspect sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was provided immediate aid by Sterling Heights officers before being transported by the Sterling Heights Fire Department to a local hospital where he is listed in stable condition. The suspect remains in police custody at the hospital. One officer sustained minor injuries and was treated at a local hospital before being released. Per Sterling Heights Police department protocol regarding officer-involved shootings, the Michigan State Police are now investigating this incident. Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw said once his department completes its investigation, a report will be sent to the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office for review."

She won a city council seat in 2003, and served in that role until securing the city clerk position in 2009. In 2015, Tyer unseated incumbent Dan Bianchi to become the first mayor in Pittsfield history to serve a four-year term. In a hard-fought 2019 campaign against city councilor Melissa Mazzeo, Tyer successfully defended her seat – after unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud from her rival led to a recount that reaffirmed her win. The next year, Tyer was faced with navigating Pittsfield through the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, subsequent economic downturn, and the rebuilding process. After choosing to not seek a third term this year, Tyer is preparing to turn over the corner office to City Council President Peter Marchetti, who defeated John Krol in November. Marchetti will be sworn in on January 2nd. WAMC visited city hall this week for an interview with the outgoing mayor. TYER: I've been thinking a lot about it because I am starting to wind down my time here in city hall, and I'm really proud of some of the things that we've accomplished in the last eight years. We got the Berkshire Innovation Center built, we got the Morningstar St. Mary's campus saved and restored, we launched the At Home in Pittsfield program, we lead the community through a global pandemic, we managed $40 million [in] federal ARPA funds. And there's so many other things big and small that I think about over the, that occurred over the last eight years. And it's really been a privilege. We've faltered in some ways too, but most of the time we've had some great successes. WAMC: Now your successor is Peter Marchetti, someone you've known for many years, he's been a close political ally, and certainly, you guys have been in close communication through this transition. If you had to communicate to him what should be on the top of his docket heading into this new year and his first term, what issues come to mind? The first thing I would encourage him to do, and we've already started putting some of this in place, is to begin the search for the next chief of police. The second thing would be to make sure that we keep the momentum going around the housing initiatives that are underway. I would say the third thing is making sure that we keep Wahconah Park on the agenda, because that is a community asset and a community amenity that I think everyone is excited about. You alluded to this earlier, but I think in a lot of ways, it'll be impossible to separate out the COVID-19 pandemic from the broader to Linda Tyer mayoral experience. When you look back on that unprecedented challenge – and there's a word that certainly in 2020, we heard almost ceaselessly – what stands out to you from that experience? I think the thing that stands out to me is just the remarkable collaboration that occurred right here inside of city hall and with our community partners to keep the community safe. It was- At the beginning, it was terrifying, and nobody really knew what to do, or how to organize or what to plan for. And so, in the beginning, the task force was meeting daily and trying to put together the best response and have the most careful advice to give to the community. And as the year, the first year went on, it became obvious that we were really in this for the long haul and the information about how it was transmitted changed, and then the information about how to keep people safe changed, and there were some really difficult decisions that had to be made during that time. But we also put out nearly a million dollars into the hands of our small businesses during the pandemic to keep them afloat during this difficult time. And then once the vaccine came online, and we put together the vaccine clinics- When I look back on it, it's going to really reflect how Pittsfield and the Berkshires, when it gets hard, we all come together. And in that particular case, there were no egos, everybody went above and beyond their job title. And I will be forever grateful for the team of people that I had the privilege of being with during that really difficult time. Partially due to historical trends and certainly exacerbated by the pandemic, Pittsfield’s budget and spending has been a big topic of conversation this year. Certainly, your final budget was considerably higher than the year before, taxes are going to be considerably higher next year than they were in 2023. When critics talk about Pittsfield having a spending problem or how to best allocate our free cash reserves towards lowering the tax rate- When you look ahead and look forward into the challenges that your successor, Peter Marchetti, will face, what's your response to those accusations about Pittsfield’s “spending problem”? Yeah, so I'm going to tackle this two ways. First, what I would like the community to know and your listeners and readers to know is that we have positioned the incoming mayor to have the best financial stability that he could possibly have. We've got more money in reserves than ever before, we've got $8 million coming in from [General Electric] to refund the city's economic development fund, we've got $500,000 available for from the opioid settlement. So, from that standpoint, there is a lot of opportunities for there to be some really creative investments in the city of Pittsfield. When it comes to the discussion about the municipal budget, I struggle a little bit to understand the criticism, quite frankly, because there were a number of things that we heard in the last year's budget and then this one that we're in now around wages, around raising wages. Pay the teachers more, we’ve got to do something for the school community, the paraprofessionals, custodians, bus drivers, we've got to raise their wages. I agreed with that. So, when you have those conversations, and you're hearing that the legislative body wants to support our schools, for example, by paying teachers more and paying the staff more, there is a consequence to that to the budget. I understand that. For the community, it is really difficult to swallow a tax rate increase whether it's a little bit or a lot or just right. The challenge is, though, that we are providing extraordinary services. People get public education and 24-hour fire protection and police protection. People get the roads plowed, people get clean drinking water, and when you flush the toilet, it goes away. All of that costs money. I would like to hear, and I hope at some point, somebody comes up with some ideas for how to cut the budget in a way that has an impact on the tax rate. So, what is it that we're willing to live without? Are we willing to live without trash collection? Are we willing to live without the other things, like a public health department? So, I think, it can't just be nibbling around the edges. If you want to impact the tax rate, it's got to be big money. During the last city council meeting of the year, Ward 1 city councilor Kenny Warren floated the idea of a residential exemption for Pittsfield moving forward, that would more equitably distribute the tax burden more so on to homeowners of high-cost properties and less so on owners of low-cost properties. This was introduced in Williamstown this year and was aggressively denied by the community. What are your thoughts on that tool? Would that be something that would help more equitably distribute the tax burden here in Pittsfield? I would have to- If I were still here, I would be interested in exploring it. It's hard to say what the impact would be, except that we know that some people would pay less and other people would pay more. I don't know from a from a public policy standpoint without having details whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for Pittsfield. But I think that the other the other piece to this is that the property values in Pittsfield have also increased, which means for the individual homeowner, you have more value in the thing that's probably your biggest asset, your home. And people forget that that's an important part of your of your calculation of your wealth. It means that you can borrow money, it means that when you go to sell your home, you can have a return on that investment. If you are keeping your home in your family, it means that your family is having an opportunity to grow their wealth. So, I'm not too sure about a residential tax exemption. I think it would be a hotly debated issue, if it ever came to the table. One of the most controversial moments of your tenure involved the police shooting of Miguel Estrella, a topic we've talked about at great length. In the fallout of that incident, many activists in the community were very critical of the City of Pittsfield for not acting quickly enough to carry out aspects of police reform or altering emergency services. From your perspective, at the end of the day, how do you think your administration reacted to that incident? And do you feel there's any credence to those criticisms? First of all, I just- It was a traumatic event for the entire community, and especially for Miguel's family and friends. And that has never left me. I will say that that was, when I think about some of the most difficult days, that's right up there. It was an awful, awful thing for the community to go through. I think though, that- And I think the questions about how do we police better are fair. I also think that we do many things well, and there's always opportunities for improvements. I know that there was momentum around this alternative emergency service model, which is interesting, but also difficult to implement. So, maybe if I was doing a third term, I would put much more, greater thought into, how do we bring that to the city of Pittsfield? In the meantime, we've expanded the co-responder program, we've created the hub, which gives us an opportunity to pull together our community partners to focus on an individual who might be in crisis and bring resources to that person. So, we've tried to create a variety of ways of responding to people who are experiencing a mental health crisis or struggling with substance use disorders. And I think, sometimes it's not an easy, one size fits all solution- Not for the city and the way that it operates or even for the individual who's in need. So, I think having a variety of ways to approach it is actually a good solution. And clearly, there's always room for improvement. During this most recently mayoral election, you largely were on the sidelines, you didn't make a lot of public appearances, though you did support Mr. Marchetti. From your perspective, when you listened to that campaign – for the first time in many years as an outsider – what were your thoughts on the discourse around Pittsfield that was being expressed on the campaign trail? Well, I think that it's always- Campaigns are always a debate or a competition for ideas. And so, you have to, sadly, you have to come up with things that are wrong, you have to state things that you think are broken and then offer a solution. So, it's all- From my perspective, it was hard to hear some of the things that were being said, but I understand how campaigns work, and I understand how the political process works. There were things that were said during the campaign that were just not true, which, also, that's the way that it goes in a campaign. But for me, personally and professionally, I know exactly who I am and I know exactly who we are. I know what we did well, I know where we struggled. And I'm really proud of my team, and I'm proud of our community. I think that there's a lot of talk about downtown, and I think it's a pretty nice place. And so that was sort of a surprise to hear. I am mystified by the idea that you would be so highly critical of your downtown, whether you're a candidate or a business owner or anyone who cares about downtown, because it is the place where we're trying to run a business or encourage people to live. And so, if you're highly critical of this place, you're- The marketing strategy has always been a little bit of a mystery to me. I want to talk about the framing of crime statistics and Pittsfield, because it's usually a hot topic in any campaign. You campaigned on crime in 2015, in 2019, your challenger Melissa Mazzeo campaigned on crime, and this year, it seems like everybody campaigned on crime. Looking over the data that's available from the Pittsfield police, we have seen a broad decrease in crime across many sectors over your tenure in office. With that in mind, what does this tell us about perceptions versus reality when it comes to crime in Pittsfield? Well, I think that Pittsfield, unfortunately, has always had a stigma around crime. And because we're in Berkshire County, and we're the largest city in the county, and our neighbors are smaller and more rural, we are certainly going to have more instances of crime and different types of crime. And so, it's easy for people to stigmatize the city of Pittsfield around crime. Obviously, crime is a campaign topic no matter what the year is, because it matters to people. People want to live in a place that safe. But, you know, again, we go back to- We have put in a variety of measures, tried implementing different things to address issues of crime. And again, it's not one silver bullet that's going to solve all of our issues around crime. But it's really smart policing, smart law enforcement, smart neighborhoods who are willing to engage in conversations around crime. Those are the things that keep our city safe. As the city prepares to hire a new police chief, what kind of things are you communicating to Marchetti about that search and about what you think – and from your experience working with the police chief – the city could most use in the next person to hold the seat? Well, I think that we have to continue to emphasize our work around equity. I think making sure that the next chief of police understands or is willing to focus on best practices around equity within the department, but also out into the community. I think the next chief inherits at a time when policing has gotten more difficult and where the expectations of what a police officer does has expanded beyond what our grandparents knew of policing. So, someone who is able to navigate the complexities of the policing, of law enforcement, and the expectations that communities have. Someone who is able to lead with a calm confidence, who inspires respect among the rank and file, the men and women in the police department, a person who can engage thoughtfully with the community. Somebody who can build a budget or be creative around, what are some of the best future strategies for law enforcement? So those would be some of the things that I would encourage the mayor elect to think about as he undertakes this this selection process. Earlier, you alluded to moments along the way where you feel like you faltered while leading Pittsfield. We mentioned the tragedy around the Miguel Estrella shooting- Are there any other examples that you feel like epitomized moments that you wished you could take a second crack at? Yes, yes, there are. And one of the- As you mentioned, we've talked about Miguel. The other one that continues to haunt me, and lots of lessons learned, was when the St. Joseph shelter- When ServiceNet closed St. Joe's shelter, and we had people who are vulnerable living in our parks. And that was so difficult for the people who were living outside, and it was an awful time for them. And they were upset and angry and hurt and struggling- And understandably so. And I wish that I had been more aggressive around engaging with ServiceNet and insisting that they reopen the shelter. At the time, I was feeling like I didn't have the authority to make a demand on a nonprofit organization. I attempted to encourage them, cajole them. But I never said to them, I am demanding and insisting that you reopen the shelter. That's something that has haunted me, and the fact that the encampment extended for such a long period of time- I learned a lot from that experience. I learned a lot about the struggles that that people who are unsheltered have. If I were ever in that situation again, I would have a completely different approach. So, that was one that was one of the one of the most difficult times in my tenure as mayor. At this point, what's next for you? Is this your retirement from public life? Do you have a new job lined up? What's the future hold for Linda Tyer? I am going to for sure step away from public life. I don't anticipate running for office of any of any type again in my future, and I'm excited about my next opportunity. I've just been selected to be the new Executive Director of Workforce Training and Community Education at Berkshire Community College. So, my next chapter will be at BCC, and I'm really looking forward to joining that academic institution and working with the whole county around, how do we help people achieve their best potential for job opportunities and for higher wages, and how do we think about that? And what's the future economy for the workforce? I’m really looking forward to it. Only years into covering you did I find out that you were a fan of the band Tool. Tell me about that- You're in the Tool Army? Is that fair to say? Yeah, I'm in the Tool Army, and people are always surprised by it. But Tool is just a magnificent group of three musicians and one singer-songwriter, and they have the most mystical, poetic sort of irreverent lyrics in their music. They're very artistic, and their music is layered in really creative ways. It's a little- I find it a little almost creepy that they released “Fear Inoculum” like two years after the pandemic, and they were writing all this music prior to the pandemic- Takes them forever to release an album. But I love their shows, I love the musicians. I think that Maynard James Keenan, who is their singer-songwriter, just has this amazing lens on the world and has crazy, crazy lyrics. But it is sort of one of those guilty pleasures that I have. Yeah. It's great. And lastly, Linda, any final message to our listeners after eight years of serving as Pittsfield mayor? So, I think about this a lot because I feel deeply, deeply honored to have been entrusted to do this work, whether it was my time on the city council or the city clerk, but especially as mayor. And when people ask me about this, I often tell the story of how I always I feel so honored to know that someone walked into a ballot booth took a ballot and filled in the oval next to my name, and I don't- I didn't ever lose sight of that. Even when people maybe disagreed with my decisions, I felt honored to be in this position for the last eight years. I want to say thank you to everyone who supported me. Even people who were critics of me taught me something, they sharpened my thinking. And as we go forward as a community, I just want us to continue thriving together, growing together, being proud of our city, being excited about the place where we live and work, welcome visitors, think about, how do we grow our economy? How do we, what's next for our public schools? Our city is so ripe with opportunities, and always keeping an eye on the future is something that, you know, hopefully, I can be engaged in other ways besides elected office to help be part of our community."

Harding will serve in the role on an interim basis while the city searches for a replacement for Police Chief Steve Mylett, who retires Dec. 31. Though Mylett is retiring after 35 years in law enforcement, his time with the city of Akron has been relatively brief; he started in the role in August 2021. His tenure was marred by the police shooting of Jayland Walker, an unarmed 25-year-old who was killed during a traffic stop when eight police officers opened fire on him on June 27, 2022. The shooting sent shockwaves through the city and spurred days of protests. Last month, an internal investigation found that the officersâ actions during the fatal encounter were âobjectively reasonableâ and that they would not be disciplined. The internal investigation came after a grand jury in April rejected criminal charges against the officers. Harding has served as deputy chief since November 2021. He holds a bachelorâs degree in technical education and an associateâs degree in criminal justice from the University of Akron. He has worked at the Akron Police Department since 1995, according to the city. He is a Leadership Akron Class 39 graduate and he has attended the Police Executive Leadership College. The city will conduct a nationwide search for Mylettâs replacement, according to the city. The search will include public engagement and community input and will take approximately 3-5 months. A search firm, Ralph Anderson & Associates, will begin the process of finding candidates in January and both internal and external candidates will be considered, according to Mayor-Elect Shammas Malik. Ralph Anderson & Associates previously led the search that found Mylett for the role. Akron residents can share their feedback about what they want to see in the cityâs next police chief via an online survey. The survey will also be translated into Spanish and Hmong and that will be available at the same link in the next week, according to the city. Hard copies of the survey will be distributed to local community centers in the coming days. The city will also have an internal survey to ask police department members to share what they would like to see in their next chief. âAs we conduct the search for Chief Mylettâs replacement, we recognize the importance of community involvement and the role of the process itself,â said Mayor-Elect Malik in a news release. âHaving a transparent process will be crucial as we continue to build trust with our community. Through these surveys and a community town hall weâll be able to provide critical input to the search team. Public safety is the top priority of my new administration, and together, we will work towards a common goal of effective and community-focused policing for Akron.â Akron residents can also attend a community town hall meeting on Thursday, Jan. 11 from 6-7:30 p.m. at Garfield CLC, located at 1326 Brown St. Community members can share their thoughts, concerns and ideas about the police chief search at that time. The event will also be live streamed to the cityâs YouTube page and input will be recorded and provided to the search firm to help them with their efforts. Want more Akron news?

In the video, Taylor spoke about his faith and gratefulness to serve in the role since December 2019. By the beginning of the new year, he would’ve served as the department chief for four years. Before being appointed chief of police, Taylor also served as assistant chief since 2017. During his 2019 swearing-in ceremony, Taylor promised to continue implementing some of the ideas championed by retiring chief Bryan Roach, like “beat policing.” In Friday’s video, Taylor said he spoke with Mayor Hogsett about a possible transition in the next few years and the mayor decided to move in a “different direction.” Taylor added that sometime in the beginning of 2024, he would be transitioning out of the role as chief and hopefully move into a position where he can “help out victim families.” In a release, Taylor said: “I have prayed about this and truly believe now is the right time for me to pass the reins to someone else.” “Our collective efforts are going in the right direction. Criminal homicides are down by 18%, non-fatal shootings down by 7%, and robberies continue to decline. These statistics are not just numbers; they represent the lives saved and neighborhoods made safer,” the release added. The chief offered his deepest thanks and gratitude for his time leading the department. Previous reports showed certain members of the community had called for the chief to step down from his role after multiple officer-involved shooting incidents in 2023. One group in particular included the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, with Reverend David Greene supporting the decision when he sat down to speak with FOX59/CBS4 Friday night. “It was really a step in the right direction,” Greene said. “I think that Chief Taylor did about as much as he could do and weâre at a place where we need different leadership to address these concerns to go farther, to do more, and to do better.”Â Rev. Charles Harrison with Indy Ten Point Coalition also shared his thoughts on Chief Taylor’s announcement. I want to thank IMPD Chief Randal Taylor for your many years of service to the city of Indianapolis.Â CongratulationsÂ on your retirement and I am thankful for many years of friendship. You are a very good man and I wish you well and may God’s blessings be upon you and your family. Mayor Joe Hogsett’s office released a statement after the announcement: Chief Randal Taylor is a trailblazer, and his nearly thirty years of service to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is a testament to his character, commitment to public service, and drive to make Indianapolis a safer city. In his time as Chief, IMPD has seen the largest reduction in homicides in department history and has placed community relations and transparency at the forefront. I thank Randy for his service to the people of this great city, and I wish him the best in this next chapter.Mayor Joe Hogsett (D) Indianapolis Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President Rick Snyder also released a statement just after 5:45 p.m. Friday: âWe learned today of the transition of the Chief of Police for IMPD. We are grateful to Chief Randy Taylor for his many years of service to the Indianapolis and Marion County community. Chief Taylor truly cares for the well-being of our officers and their families. His years as Chief were during some of the toughest challenges our capital city has faced. We thank him for his leadership and for the sacrifices made by his family. As the page is turned by Mayor Joe Hogsett, we look forward to learning of his next steps as Indianapolis completes the fourth consecutive year of record levels of violence with officer retention being critical as we enter 2024. Morale mattersâ¦”Rick Snyder, Indianapolis FOP President Around 7:45 p.m. Friday, FOX59/CBS4 received the following statement from Indianapolis City-County Council President Vop Osili: I have tremendous respect for Chief Randal Taylor and his almost 30 years of dedicated service to our city. He guided IMPD through some of the most difficult times our city has ever seen. His desire to continue serving this community is a great reflection of the committed public servant Chief Taylor has always been.” FOX59/CBS4 has reached out for statements from several groups on the IMPD announcement and will update as we learn more. This is a developing story."

The St. Clair Police Department reports an officer conducted a traffic stop after receiving a tip that the driver was unable to stay on the road and maintain a lane. “As the officer was conducting an investigation, the suspect tried to flee, dragging the officer. The officer fired striking the suspect,” stated the St. Clair Police Department via a news release. The suspect took off from the scene, prompting a brief pursuit. It ended after nearly half a mile when the suspect reportedly drove into the back of the business. Police say one man was arrested, but did not disclose his name or age. St. Clair police say the suspect and officer are both being treated for what they believe to be non-life-threatening injuries. The Missouri State Highway Patrol has been called to investigate circumstances around the officer’s gunfire. MSHP was not involved in this incident. This is a developing story. FOX 2 will update as more information becomes available."

Watch the breaking news report from Downtown Pittsburgh in the video above Police Chief Larry Scirotto said the shots were fired inside Arby's in the 800 block of Liberty Avenue, near Wood Street. A man in his mid-20s suffered a gunshot wound to the leg and has been detained by police. That man was found in Market Square and was taken to the hospital. He is reported to be in stable condition. ""There was, like, seven or eight policemen surrounding this gentleman, and at that point, they had him handcuffed, and then a few minutes later, an ambulance showed up, and they put him in an ambulance and took him away,"" said Ken Thompson, a witness who described the scene in Market Square. Scirotto said a second person involved in the shooting fled the scene and remains at large. A manager who was in the back of the restaurant when the shooting happened called 911, police said. ""They took refuge in the freezer for their own safety until we arrived, and we were on scene within less than one minute,"" Scirotto said. He said approximately 15 rounds were fired between the two people involved, who apparently knew each other and had gotten into a confrontation inside the restaurant. A firearm was recovered near the scene, police said. Thompson said the shooting did not change his perspective of downtown. ""I generally feel pretty safe round here,"" Thompson said. ""I’ve never really had any issue myself, but I hear of the incidents that happen now and then. For a larger city, I still feel pretty safe down here."" Pittsburgh's Action News 4's Bob Mayo asked Scirotto what he would tell people who may draw negative conclusions about downtown Pittsburgh after hearing about the shooting. ""These incidents are isolated,"" Scirotto said. ""We continue to remain vigilant in keeping downtown safe."" Scirotto added that access to illegal firearms is still an issue police are trying to tackle. Download the WTAE mobile app to stay connected with breaking news."

(WKRG) — The City of Mobile will host a Scrap Tire Amnesty Day on Feb. 24 to give Mobilians an easy way to dispose of old tires. Tires that are not disposed of properly can cause environmental degradation and possibly create breeding habitats for mosquitos and other pests, according to a news release from the city. An average of one scrap tire is created annually for each U.S. motorist on the roadways, according to the Scrap Tire Management Council. That means that thousands of scrap tires are created annually in Mobile. “We want to make it easy for Mobilians to do the right thing,” Mayor Sandy Stimpson said. “This event allows residents to dispose of unwanted scrap tires responsibly. I want to thank our staff and the volunteers from Osprey Initiative and the Student Conservation Association, who are making this upcoming event possible.” City of Mobile employees along with volunteers from Osprey Initiative and The Student Conservation Association, Inc. will collect scrap tires at three locations from 8 to 11 a.m. on that Saturday. Those locations include: - Baumhauer-Randle Park - Medal of Honor Park - City of Mobile Recycling Center The event was initially scheduled for December, but weather conditions led the city to reschedule it.

Andrew Reineke, 30, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and second-degree attempted murder on Sept. 20. He initially faced charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault and menacing. “This was a horrific crime with devastating consequences,” 17th Judicial District Attorney Brian Mason said in a release. “The defendant murdered a neighbor, shot at multiple police officers and put countless lives in danger. I commend the heroic actions of the law enforcement officers who responded to this dangerous scene. The defendant will now have 50 years in prison to consider his egregious actions.” Affidavit details neighbor, police shooting The charges stem from an Aug. 3, 2021, confrontation between Reineke and his neighbor, Andrew Ervin, 65. Reineke initiated the confrontation near their Commerce City homes on Grape Street and shot Ervin 11 times in the back. This is when Commerce City police arrived on scene and found Ervin on the ground with apparent gunshot wounds, and began to search for Reineke. According to the DA’s office, Reineke fled the scene — hiding behind a truck and ducking into an alley, as well as menacing a family with his firearm so they would stay quiet. As officers spoke to a person not involved in the homicide, Reineke opened fire. Six officers ended up returning fire, hitting Reineke. A gunshot went through an officer’s sleeve, but no officers were injured. Reineke also hit a deputy’s vehicle and was struck by an officer’s gunfire, leading to his eventual apprehension. Mason issued a decision letter in June 2022 for the officer-involved shooting, finding their actions justified and appropriate. “The facts of the investigation support a conclusion that, at the time the officers used force upon Mr. Reineke, the officers reasonably believed that Mr. Reineke presented a threat to themselves as well as the other civilians in the area,” Mason wrote. “These facts further support a conclusion that the officers reasonably believed that the degree of force they employed was necessary to prevent the risk of harm presented by Mr. Reineke. Under the circumstances, the use of a less lethal force was not a reasonable alternative.” Involved officers issue sentencing statements Two involved officers provided statements to the judge during Reineke’s sentencing hearing. “Andrew Reineke heard me talking on the radio, he saw me in full police uniform, and he waited to ambush,” one officer said, according to the DA’s office. “He opened fire with every round he had in his gun. As I retreated having no idea where this gunfire was coming from, I took a bullet through my right sleeve. He continued to shoot as I retreated to a place of cover. “Thank god my training and luck trumped yours,” the officer continued. “I gave my tourniquet to help save his life. We did this because we are professionals, not cold-blooded murderers. Evil of this level has no place amongst us, our children, or our children’s children.” A second officer called Reineke a coward and said the shooter’s “complete disregard for human life is disgusting.” “I remember telling myself, this guy isn’t going to win, and I am going to go home to my family. I feel like I can’t breathe at times when waking up from those nightmares,” the second officer said. “I am thankful, along with my partners, that we are alive today to be with our families, our brothers, and sisters in blue, and that I am able to continue this profession that I have been called to do. Andrew Reineke, you tried to take our lives away, but you failed,” the officer said. “You are nothing but a monster in my eyes. You have nothing good to contribute to society.”"

(WLNS) — East Lansing’s police accountability body has made recommendations to the policies on use of force in the local police department, the city announced in a news release Friday. The East Lansing Independent Police Oversight Commission formed in 2021 after City Council approved a resolution to establish the commission. At the Dec. 6 meeting, ELIPOC issued recommendations to the East Lansing Police Department’s use of force/response to resistance policy. “The commission encourages the department to manage its operations and train its officers to use the minimum degree of force necessary to enforce the law and to avoid the use of force altogether when possible,” said ELIPOC Commission Vice Chair Chris Root. ELPD Chief Kim Johnson will now make the decision on whether to adopt the recommendations into policy, according to ELIPOC Chair Erick Williams. According to the news release from the city, ELIPOC drew its recommendations from the American Law Institute’s Principles on the Use of Force; the policies of the Berkeley, California police department; and model policies from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. ELIPOC’S policy recommendations to ELPD included: - Chokeholds should be prohibited. - Officers should be required to intervene if they see fellow officers using force improperly. - Officers should document each incident when they use force, on the same day as the incident. The department should review past incidents with a view to preventing the need for force in future incidents. ELIPOC began developing the recommendations for changes to the department’s policies after East Lansing police shot a man in the parking lot of an East Lansing Meijer store in April 2022, according to Commission Chair Williams. “The community was disturbed, and there were people who petitioned us to [make these recommendations],” Williams said. A fatal shooting involving Lansing Police Department officers happened this month on Dec. 1."

During a disciplinary trial in 2014, the medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Garner’s body said that the chokehold led to “a lethal sequence of events,” the Associated Press reported. If Garner had received the proper medical attention he begged for, he’d still be alive today, Gwen Carr, Garner’s mother said during a legislative briefing Thursday afternoon. Carr was one of several family members who came from across the country to speak on behalf of a bill that would guarantee emergency medical care to people during law enforcement contact. “This has to stop,” Carr cried. “We are all human beings no matter what. We all deserve medical attention. If it was your child lying on the ground, if it was your child being choked out, if it was your child being beaten or being shot lying on the ground, you would want him to have medical attention or even yourself.” The bill “An Act Establishing Medical Civil Rights,” would require Massachusetts law enforcement officers to immediately request emergency medical services for anyone who appears to require emergency medical attention or says so during law enforcement interactions. If it’s approved, and eventually signed into law, the bill would make Massachusetts the second state in the country to guarantee the right to receive emergency medical services during a law enforcement contact. Connecticut was the first state to do so in 2023. The legislation is the product of years of research by the Medical Civil Rights Initiative, a group that drafted and is advocating for the passage of this bill. The group’s director, Leonore Dluhy, began drafting the bill with her father, the late Dr. Robert G. Dluhy, in 2015 after the police killing of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, who died of a fatal spinal cord injury after being detained by Baltimore police officers. Although the legislation was first introduced in February 2021, it never made it out of committee. Now, grieving mothers, fathers and siblings who’ve all lost someone in law enforcement interactions are demanding that lawmakers act on the bill. “The legislators keep saying, ‘well, we don’t need that bill’,” Fredrick L. Brown, a retired Massachusetts appellate judge who serves as a member of the Medical Civil Rights Initiative, said. “Well, that’s why these people are here today, to tell you they wouldn’t be here if we had that bill. That’s simple as that.” Vicki Willis, the mother of Alteriq Pleasant, a 27-year-old Black man from Chicago, said she hasn’t slept in a year since her child died after experiencing a medical emergency while detained in Cook County jail. Willis, whose son’s name means “the pathway to God”, said that her son died asking for help while someone was attacking him. “I want you to understand that this bill, it’s for children with autism who can’t say something and they might need help,” Willis said as tears streamed down her cheeks. “It’s for my mother who’s diabetic and her sugar might be dropping. Someone you know might have diabetes and they can’t tell them that their sugar is dropping! They might seem like they’re drunk and they’re not drunk because they’ve had a head contusion – that’s what this bill is for, so they can get help!” Valerie Copeland shared the story of her husband Al, who was arrested in April 2019 after police found him sitting unconscious in his car one night. Police assumed he was intoxicated, but he actually had been suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke. Al Copeland was driving down Massachusetts Avenue in Boston to help a friend check her nephew into rehab when he started feeling sick. He quickly pulled his car to the side of the road and put his hazard lights on. It was two hours before anyone came to help Al Copeland. But when help did come, it was three police officers who took him down to a police station for five hours while he was having a stroke, instead of calling an ambulance. “Nobody assumed that he might have needed medical care,” Valerie Copeland said. “The police made the call that he was intoxicated because they did not think that he might have been sick. I don’t know of any intoxicated person that parks their car and puts on their hazards. If you know of someone, please let me know. It was a call for help and when help came help was denied.” Her husband survived the stroke, “by the grace of God,” Valerie Copeland said. But the 62-year-old now walks with a cane and has short-term memory issues. His recollection of that fateful day in April 2019 has been wiped clean from his mind. “He cannot tell this story, so I’m here to tell this story,” Valerie Copeland said. “People contact the police for help. They are considered first responders and if someone is in need of medical care, people who are trained to use a gun should not be relied upon to make a medical judgment in the field.” Understanding disability and police encounters Brown said police officers are in favor of the bill because it shifts the responsibility from them to their detainees on whether to request medical attention. “It takes him off the hook,” he said. “If some guy’s in pain, if he says ‘bring in the meds’, that’s it. [The police] can’t be held liable because he did what he’s supposed to do. The guys that are getting jammed up don’t do that.” When police are apprehending someone, they usually view the individual as someone who needs to be controlled rather than someone who might need medical attention, Christopher Robertson, a professor of health law, disability and management at Boston University, told MassLive. Nearly 60 percent of people fatally shot by police officers in Massachusetts since 2016 had either been experiencing a mental health crisis or had a mental illness, according to a report from the Boston Globe. Jennifer Root Bannon’s brother Juston, who lives with schizoid affective disorder, said he was fatally shot in 2020 after police officers thought he brandished a firearm outside Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “My brother never threatened anyone. My brother never took out a weapon. He showed clear signs of mental distress,” Bannon said. “Had hospital campus police had a specific duty to immediately summon care as under the Medical Civil Rights Act, my brother would be alive today. My brother was at a hospital, he needed to be hospitalized.” Although police officers have to adhere to standards of reasonable care under negligence law, there isn’t a clear black-and-white rule as to when to request medical attention, leaving it up to the individual officer to decide, Robertson told MassLive. “It’s kind of like the difference between having a rule that says drive reasonably on the interstate versus a rule that says drive no faster than 70 miles an hour,” he said. “When someone violates that speed they knew what the rule was and then we can hold them accountable for it.” A law such as the Medical Civil Rights Act would change the outcome of so many law enforcement interactions that’ve gone wrong, Bannon said. Despite its provisions, she’s “shocked and dismayed” that the bill has been held up in the Legislature for so long. “If Massachusetts passed Nero’s Law, which is emergency medical care for police dogs, they can pass the Medical Civil Rights Act for the people here in Massachusetts,” Bannon said. “This should be our civil right, a right to emergency medical care.”"

One key target: Representative Ilhan Omar. Jonathan Weisman and Jonathan Weisman reported from Minneapolis and St. Louis Park, Minn. Kate Kelly reported from Washington. Tim Peterson, a bald and burly Air Force veteran running for Congress in Minnesota’s Fifth District, wants to discuss the “existential” problem that Minneapolis faces with mass retirements of police officers looming on the horizon. But he has to state something else first: Hamas is fascist. Sarah Gad, a youthful criminal defense lawyer running for the same seat, is passionate about criminal justice reform, but, she acknowledged, everyone wants to know her feelings about the conflict in Gaza. Don Samuels, another candidate, has a lifetime of public service to promote as a retired city councilman from North Minneapolis. But, he noted, “there is, of course, the international issue” hanging over the race: Israel and Palestine. All three are challenging Representative Ilhan Omar, one of Israel’s fiercest critics in Congress, in next August’s Democratic primary. But only one of them is likely to be the beneficiary of a tidal wave of campaign cash from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, its super PAC and other pro-Israel allies incensed by the Democratic left’s criticism of the Jewish state after Hamas’s attacks on Oct. 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza. Eight months before Democratic voters decide, a pre-primary primary has begun. Call it the AIPAC primary, with each of Ms. Omar’s opponents making a case for why they deserve a boost. “Four million would be more than enough for us to do what we need to do,” Joe Radinovich, the Democratic operative running Mr. Samuels’s campaign, suggested. It’s unclear just how much AIPAC, its super PAC the United Democracy Project, or another pro-Israel group, the Democratic Majority for Israel, will spend in this race or nationally. The United Democracy Project spent nearly $36 million in 2022, with D.M.F.I. raising $9 million. Liberal groups like Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party have bandied about the figure $100 million in their counter-fund-raising campaigns. AIPAC and its allies refuse to put out a number but say the total will most likely dwarf previous cycles. Haim Saban, one of the Democrats’ largest donors, said Thursday that the band of Israel critics in his party were “small and loud” but it would be “a dangerous development, and against the U.S. security interest, for the Democratic Party to allow more members” of that group in. “God bless AIPAC for taking this initiative,” he said. Ms. Omar responded, “We know that organized people beat organized money. And I am confident that I will once again earn the confidence my constituents have bestowed upon me.” AIPAC’s other likely targets in Congress are not a secret. At the top are Representative Cori Bush, an activist voice from St. Louis, whose Democratic challenger, Wesley Bell, investigated the Ferguson, Mo., police shooting of Michael Brown and has already garnered Jewish support in the city. Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York will face the Westchester County executive George Latimer, who was recruited by the pro-Israel groups. Representative Summer Lee in Pittsburgh, a freshman, is also high on the target list. Two candidates have emerged in Detroit to say they were offered $20 million to challenge Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress and one of two Muslim women. Ms. Omar, the other Muslim woman in the House, will be difficult to unseat, but she is too tempting a target to be left off the list. Donors have requested her by name, and her challengers have been open about their quest for that cash. Ms. Gad, an Egyptian American Muslim, said she had two interlocutors, including an Israeli filmmaker, Jonathan Baruch, pressing her case with AIPAC. Mr. Samuels, who came within two percentage points of beating Ms. Omar in the 2022 primary, was in New York on Thursday for a fund-raiser organized by the hedge fund manager Brian Eizenstat, son of Stuart E. Eizenstat, a former diplomat and deputy Treasury secretary. Mr. Peterson, a gym owner and former deep-sea captain, made the case that he has the stamina to knock on doors in every quadrant of the district. Pro-Israel groups “should be very careful to give that money to someone who is going to be here and get the work done,” he said in a dingy campaign office in an emptying apartment block in Minneapolis’s Uptown neighborhood. The group’s push into Democratic primaries has not gone unnoticed. “Wherever AIPAC’s Republican billionaires can find a warm body to regurgitate their right-wing talking points and primary progressive Democrats, they will,” said Usamah Andrabi, a spokesman for the Justice Democrats, which was formed to encourage Democratic primary challenges from the left. AIPAC critics argue that its unconditional support of the Israeli government and its willingness to spend against detractors in Congress can take the focus off critical domestic issues. “It is not what most American voters are showing up to the polls voting on,” said Tali deGroot, who runs the political action committee for J Street, a pro-Israeli group that is critical of Israel’s government. J Street has endorsed some of AIPAC’s targets, including Ms. Lee. AIPAC and its affiliate organizations support many Democrats, including centrists like Representative Abigail Spanberger, who is now running for governor in Virginia, and Representative Jared Golden of Maine, who recently called for gun restrictions after a mass shooting in his district. But AIPAC’s skeptics note that the organization’s single-minded focus has led it to back more than 100 members of Congress who objected to certifying the 2020 election results. Even more galling to critics is that much of AIPAC’s own funding comes from Republicans. So far this cycle, the United Democracy Project has received $1 million from Bernard Marcus, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot who primarily supports Republican candidates and groups. It received $500,000 from Michael Leffell, an investor who also supports Republicans. Past donors have included the WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum, who gave the group $2 million in 2022, and the hedge-fund manager Paul Singer, who gave $1 million that year. Jews in Greater Minneapolis are sensitive to the charge that outside money will influence a race with particular local dynamics. Avi Olitzky, a former rabbi at one of the largest synagogues in the region, rejected the “AIPAC primary” label as a “red herring.” “This race should not be about money or financing or backing,” he said, adding, “We need a member of Congress in this district who represents the pro-Israel mainstream as represented by President Biden.” But Jewish leaders say the divide over Ms. Omar has supercharged interest in the primary. After the Oct. 7 massacre, Rabbi Alexander Davis, of Beth El Synagogue in the heavily Jewish suburb of St. Louis Park, said Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, and Nadia Mohamed, a Muslim just elected to be St. Louis Park’s next mayor, reached out in sympathy. Ms. Omar has not. A solidarity service on Oct. 10 drew more than 2,000 people, including Mr. Walz and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Ms. Omar was not one of them. (An aide said she had votes in Washington that night.) “She is an extreme figure, far outside the mainstream of the Jewish community,” Rabbi Davis said. Ms. Omar pushed back on the suggestion that she has been disengaged. “Amid the horrifying carnage in Israel and Gaza, we have worked day and night to secure the evacuation of multiple constituents out of Israel and the Gaza Strip,” she said in a statement. “We have worked with regional partners to press for the release of all hostages and are leading an international parliamentary push for a cease-fire.” She has her Jewish supporters, especially in the extremely liberal city of Minneapolis, which last month voted into power a left-wing majority on the City Council, led by a slate from the Democratic Socialists of America. David Brauer, a journalist in Minneapolis for 30 years and a Jewish member of Ms. Omar’s informal “kitchen cabinet,” said the congresswoman is taking the primary fight seriously. Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg, who leads a flock of what she calls “anti-Zionist and non-Zionist” Jews in the city, has had plenty of personal contact with Ms. Omar since Oct. 7. “Her leadership for a cease-fire has made me so proud that she represents me,” she said over an oat-milk latte at a vegan cafe. The coming primary season will be intense, not only for the district’s Jews but for its Palestinian, Somali and broader Muslim population, said Steve Hunegs, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas. Ms. Omar, who came to the country as a Somali refugee, is probably the most popular and most reviled Democrat in the state, he said, adored by many, deeply opposed by many, with few Minnesotans indifferent. “We’re going to see activism at all levels,” Mr. Hunegs said.

Police identified the suspect as 43-year-old Kent Edwards, who they said was wanted in connection to an unsolved shooting from October. The New York Police Department shared photos of the officers' shields and vests, which showed damage from the bullets, and saved their lives. These are the items used to save the lives of our officers at today’s officer-involved shooting,"" police wrote on X, which is the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, who heads the department, said officers responded to a public housing development in Manhattan around 11:45 a.m. He said two women came to the door, with officers learning a man, later identified as Edwards, was barricaded in the bathroom and armed with a gun. Maddrey said the officers spoke to Edwards and tried to get him to ""surrender peacefully"" before they deployed a small rolling camera, which the suspect ""was able to render useless."" He said they sent in a drone, which Edwards swatted out of the air with a broom and ""basically destroyed."" Maddrey said officers then used a rolling robot with a camera and followed it while armed with guns and shields. As they went in, the male exited the bathroom and fired what we believe (were) four shots,"" the chief said during a media briefing. ""He struck a small bunker -- a small shield -- one time. He struck one of our larger bunkers twice, and one of our members from ESU took a projectile to his bulletproof vest."" Maddrey said the officers shot Edwards twice and pinned him down with one of the shields. Edwards was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital, where he died a few hours after the shooting. Maddrey said the officer who was hit by a bullet was also taken to an area hospital, where he is being treated and doing well. When you talk about a close call, of course it was a close call,"" Maddrey said. ""You have three bullets inside the bunkers, which could have easily been three bullets inside our officers."" Police said Edwards had 11 prior arrests dating back to 1995. Previous charges include rape, sexual abuse, strangulation, as well as failing to register as a sex offender. Maddrey said Edwards was wanted in connection to the shooting outside Izzy's, a bar, on October 18. Maddrey said Thursday's shooting remains under investigation."

Taylor made this announcement in a video posted to the IMPDtv YouTube channel Friday. He also wrote a letter to Indianapolis residents, explaining his decision. In his video message, the IMPD officer said he had previously signed up for a drop program. This would have required him to remain in his role for two more years, gradually preparing for retirement. But, Taylor said he “really didn’t think that [he] could” commit to two more years as the Chief of Police. After speaking with Indy Mayor Joe Hogsett, he learned that the city was going to take a “different route,” which answered his prayers. The sitting chief also wrote a letter to Indianapolis residents, explaining his decision. In it, he said: “Since 2020, I’ve witnessed the strength and resilience of our city, its people, and the incredible brave men and women of the IMPD… Together, we were able to embark on a journey of transformation, transparency, accountability, and working to make the city a safer place for people to live, work, and visit.” In recent months, activists had called for Taylor to step down from his post. Critics were concerned about the increased number of officer-involved shootings and violent confrontations that had been making headlines around Central Indiana. Even though he and other law enforcement officials endured challenges, Taylor said he is proud of all that he and his department have accomplished. He also credited his community with making change possible. While he will no longer be the department’s Police Chief, Taylor does still plan to continue working with IMPD. He intends to work with “victim families” and others, at least for the next 1.5 years. He concluded his letter by saying, “Thank you, Indianapolis, for allowing me the honor to serve you.” - Pacers GM: Contract Extension Talks with Buddy Hield Are “At a Halt” But That Doesn’t Mean They’re Done - Murder Suspect Kevin Mason Captured - FOUND: Momo the Monkey on the Loose: Indianapolis’ East Side on High Alert - Pence: Trump Owes it to the American People to Debate - NWS: Expect a Rainy Wednesday Across Indiana - Second-Largest Jackpot in Hoosier Lottery History Won in Speedway - Teacher Fired After Complaining About Students in Recording - Cathedral High School on Lockdown Tuesday Afternoon - Indiana State Police K9 Koda Receives Life-Saving Armor - Kendall And Casey - Big Ten Championship Game's Future in Indianapolis Uncertain After 2024. - Colts Wide Receiver Alec Pierce joins the Company - Did John Kerry Just FART During Climate Change Panel??"

(WHNT) â It’s a dangerous job working as a repo man. Just two days ago, a North Alabama tow truck driver was shot to death while trying to repossess a vehicle and in the police shooting of Steve Perkins, police reported that the deadly situation started when Perkins pulled a gun on a tow truck driver who was trying to repossess his truck. Former repo man Steve Andrews says the best time to pick up a vehicle is when the car owner is not home. Sometimes they are and that’s dangerous. He said he’s had guns pulled on him several times and has been shot at. He keeps a 9mm shell casing from one of those times for good luck. “I pulled up to his car backed up to it and he came out and he shot next to my foot and said ‘thats your posterior if you take that car’ and we were well past taking that car,” Andrews recalls. Andrews said stopping a repossession on private property is possible. Repo agents cannot use violence threats of violence or force when attempting to take a vehicle. “When I go to pick up a vehicle,” he said. “I have a repo order and it’s just from the bank that says ‘we authorize him to go on somebody else’s property and take that vehicle’ but it doesn’t give you the authority over the objections of the debtor if you’re on private property,” But at the end of the day, if you are behind on your car payments, your lender has the legal right to repossess your car. Andrews worked as a repo man for 13 years. He says the job can be dangerous. “When someone came out and caught me first thing I did was play dumb,” Andrews said. “I mean it worked every time.” Andrews is now a pastor and calls himself the neighborhood “hope” dealer."

He will remain with the department for another year and a half, in a different capacity. “As the year draws to a close, so does my term as your Police Chief.” Taylor added “I’ve been in this job for 36 years, 30 here in Indy and four as your Chief. It’s truly been an honor to serve you in this community.” Mayor Joe Hogsett had the following comments: “Chief Randal Taylor is a trailblazer, and his nearly thirty years of service to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is a testament to his character, commitment to public service, and drive to make Indianapolis a safer city. In his time as Chief, IMPD has seen the largest reduction in homicides in department history and has placed community relations and transparency at the forefront. I thank Randy for his service to the people of this great city, and I wish him the best in this next chapter.â City-County Council President Vop Osili released the following statement: “I have tremendous respect for Chief Randal Taylor and his almost 30 years of dedicated service to our city. He guided IMPD through some of the most difficult times our city has ever seen. His desire to continue serving this community is a great reflection of the committed public servant Chief Taylor has always been.” The Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis has been critical of Chief Taylor’s leadership. Its leader Pastor David Greene said he’s happy the chief is stepping aside. “I feel like it’s a step in the right direction, our organization had called for his resignation earlier, looking at the various challenges that we have.” Greene said he’s frustrated with how Taylor has handled some of the police involved shootings that occurred under his watch. “The chief is the one that gets to say how he’s going to address these officers and none of them as he’s said, I recommend them for termination.” Chief Taylor also wrote this letter to the community: Message from Chief Randal Taylor Good afternoon, As the year draws to a close, I wanted to let you know so does my term as your Police Chief. It’s with a heart full of gratitude that I address you today. After 36 years in law enforcement, 30 of them right here in Indianapolis, and the last four years as IMPD Chief of Police, the time has come for me to step back and pass the torch to new leadership. This decision was not made lightly. I have prayed about this and truly believe now is the right time for me to pass the reins to someone else. Over the past few weeks, I have had a lot of time for thoughtful reflection on our time together and am truly amazed by what weâve been able to accomplish. Since 2020, I’ve witnessed the strength and resilience of our city, its people, and the incredible brave men and women of the IMPD. Thereâs no doubt in my mind the last few years have been some of the most challenging in law enforcement. But together, we were able to embark on a journey of transformation, transparency, accountability, and working to make the city a safer place for people to live, work, and visit. Together, we implemented crucial changes aimed at building trust and fostering positive relationships between law enforcement and the community. Body-worn cameras became a standard, and a majority of officers are equipped with the technology. Weâve created critical incident videos which are shared openly on social media and with the community so that you yourself can see what your officers are doing day in and day out. Implicit bias training, de-escalation training, mental health first aide and the Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement (ABLE) program became integral components of our officers’ training along with the outstanding training our officers were already completing. The creation of the Use of Force Board and General Orders Boards, both with a civilian majority, ensure a thorough examination of policies and a fair review of certain use of force incidents. Together, we re-wrote the use of force policy, incorporating key elements like proportionate force, the duty to intervene, and a strict prohibition on chokeholds. We hosted town halls in every police district, engaged in direct question and answer session, and held a Hispanic and Latino town hall, all to ensure transparency and clear communication with you, our residents. Our collective efforts are going in the right direction. Criminal homicides are down by 18%, non-fatal shootings down by 7%, and robberies continue to decline. These statistics are not just numbers; they represent the lives saved and neighborhoods made safer. While these are accomplishments during my tenure, they belong to each officer, community member, and partner who worked tirelessly alongside us. I am grateful for your support, collaboration, and dedication. To the officers of this great department, I send you my deepest thanks and gratitude. Being your Police Chief has been an incredible blessing and I am in awe of your dedication, your bravery, your compassion, and your commitment to this community. We are a safer city because of your efforts, and for that, we should be grateful. As for whatâs next, I plan to continue to stay on the IMPD to serve this community in other meaningful ways, continuing to good work we have already accomplished by working together. I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. Thank you, Indianapolis, for allowing me the honor to serve you. Chief Randal P. Taylor. NEWS 8 will have more on this story as it develops."

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation has been looking into the case since August, when the pregnant 21-year-old was shot by a Blendon Township Police officer outside of a Kroger. Young was suspected of stealing liquor when two officers tried to stop her and asked her multiple times to get out of her car. One of the officers shot Young when she drove forward. Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney Mat Heck was appointed special prosecutor in this case. His office confirmed that it received the reports from BCI this week. They’ll go over the case and make a decision: they can file charges against the officer who shot Young, convene a grand jury, or take no action. Since the Aug. 24 shooting the officers involved were considered victims by the city and therefore afforded victim’s rights under Marsy’s Law. That includes not releasing their names. With this latest development, Young’s family is demanding their victim’s rights be honored, too. “‘Kiya mattered to me. She mattered to the family. She mattered to the kids. She had a slew of people that loved her,” said Young’s grandmother, Nadine Young. Nadine wears her granddaughter’s ashes in a shimmering blue pendant on a gold chain around her neck. “(Ta’Kiya) is golden to me. And I want her to constantly shine,” Young said. Young’s attorney, Sean Walton, was unaware that the investigation had been sent to a special prosecutor until NBC4 called him to seek comment on it. “We’ve not been aware of what the timeline looks like, what the process looks like, whether there will be special prosecutors, or whether it will be held– handled in-house,” Walton said. “So there has not been, in my opinion, the proper amount of communication.” Proper communication with a victim’s family is guaranteed in Ohio under Marsy’s Law. Even though the officer who shot Young — identified by Walton shortly after the incident as Connor Grubb — has not been charged with a crime, Young is the victim in the context of the investigation. “Victims are entitled to an active role in criminal prosecutions,” said Elizabeth Well, legal director of the Ohio Crime Victim Justice Center. “They’re entitled to information about investigations.” The OCVJC is working with Walton to ensure the Young family is afforded those rights as Ta’Kiya’s next of kin. “I have not — just to be super clear — gotten any indication that they wouldn’t be kept informed,” Well said. “But my concern is that if the perception is the law enforcement officers are the true victims, that’s going to exclude her family.” In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Blendon Township police classified both officers involved in the encounter as assault victims because one officer’s hand was still in the window when Young started driving, and her car struck the other officer. “It’s mutually exclusive. If you say that Ta’Kia is a victim, then you’re necessarily saying that the officers who killed her are not victims,” Well explained. “But if you say that they are victims – that the officers are victims – then you are saying that Ta’Kiya is not a victim.” The police department withheld both officer’s names, citing their rights under Marsy’s Law. Ryan Stubenrauch, an attorney who serves as the spokesman for Blendon Township police, told NBC4 that the department had considered withholding Young’s name as well, but chose not to because Young had been publicly identified by the coroner and her family. Well said because Young had died, officials were legally permitted to release her name. Stubenrauch said Blendon Township also didn’t know about the special prosecutor, nor do they know about the results of the BCI investigation. Once they get those results, Stubenrauch said the department will begin its own administrative investigation into the case. The Franklin County prosecutor’s office told NBC4 the use of a special prosecutor in an officer-involved shooting case is common practice. The case will still be considered in Franklin County, and before a grand jury from Franklin County, if the special prosecutor decides to go that route."

Just before noon Thursday, officers were looking to arrest a suspect wanted on multiple warrants. But before they could do so, the man armed with a gun barricaded himself inside the Lower East Side apartment on Eldridge Street between Stanton and Rivington streets, sources and a city official told NBC New York. A standoff ensued, only coming to an end when the man shot at a robot sent in by police — and then he fired at officers. A senior law enforcement official said the man, identified as Kent Edwards, got off about four or five shots in all before officers fired back. The 43-year-old Edwards was struck twice by the gunfire before officers pinned him down using a shield. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition, sources said.

An ESU officer with the department was hit in the vest from an apparent ricochet, three law enforcement sources said. The officer did not appear to be injured. Police had previously sent a drone through an open window of the apartment. The suspect swatted it away with a broomstick and knocked it down. Edwards had been wanted for a shooting outside of an Upper East Side bar and for alleged sexual abuse in Manhattan from April, for which he had failed to register as a sex offender, police said. He had 11 prior arrests dating back to 1995, with the most recent one coming on Feb. 23 for an alleged rape."

But the song would take on an eerie legend after Hare shot and killed his partner and a Minneapolis Police officer in 1963. MINNEAPOLIS â On a subzero Sunday night in December 1963, Auburn âPatâ Hare held a hot pistol in his hand. His companion, Mrs. Agnes Winje, 49, lay bleeding on the floor of the south Minneapolis apartment she and Hare, 32, shared. He had shot her, several times. A neighbor had called the police to report a domestic disturbance. Officer James E. Hendricks responded, coming through the front door of Winje's apartment. Hare shot Hendricks three times, knocking him to the ground. Hendricksâ partner, Patrolman Charles Langaard, was a few paces behind, and he shot Hare. Hendricks died on the way to the hospital; Winje would survive for a short time before she, too, died. ADVERTISEMENT Hare, described in news reports as a local window cleaner, would recover from his injuries, but would spend the rest of his life behind bars thanks to his violent Dec. 16 spree. In the coming weeks, it was learned that Hare was not only a window cleaner, but an accomplished guitarist. In fact, as Pat Hare, he had played guitar on some of the most formative blues songs of the 1950s, and had developed an innovative and influential style that presaged rock-and-roll and heavy metal music. But his legend would be forever tied with a song he recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, nine years earlier. It seemed that Hare predicted his fate â and his crime â in a malicious-sounding track with a devastating title: âIâm Gonna Murder My Baby.â A frightening, futuristic recording At Memphisâ iconic Sun Studio on May 14, 1954 (three weeks before a teenaged Elvis Presley was scheduled for his first recording session), the order of the day was to make a couple sides with blues harmonica player James Cotton. Cottonâs guitar player, a talented 23-year-old called Pat Hare, was to follow with a recording of his own. Hare was suitably warmed up after playing behind Cotton, easily laying down crunching, distorted power chords in the song âCotton Crop Blues.â The piercing guitar sound would become as influential as it was frightening. Hare had just given everyone in the room a glimpse into the future of rock music. Now, depending on the story you believe, either Sun Records impresario Sam Phillips or divine inspiration brought the tunes to Hare that day. But what is a fact is that Hare plugged in his guitar, amplifier buzzing, and sat back as the piano came in. Hare met the melody and then laid down a thick, heavy chord, drawling the first lines: ADVERTISEMENT Good morning judge, and your jury too Iâve got a few things that Iâd like to say to you Iâm gonna murder my baby Yes, Iâm gonna murder my baby (I just thought youâd like to know judge) Yes, Iâm gonna murder my baby Donât do nothing but cheat and lie â¦ With its heavy, deliberate pace, Hare unleashed an apocalyptic three minutes of blues. To match the brutal sound came vivid and violent lyrics, the tongue-in-cheek boasts this raw music needed. The menace of Hareâs guitar was cut by his high-pitched, countrified vocals â¦ a chaotic mix of mayhem and mirth more fitting a comic book villain than a popular music singer. Phillips decided not to release Hareâs song, for whatever reason (it would be released years later on a black-market record). But the bluntly named âIâm Gonna Murder My Babyâ would haunt Auburn ""Pat"" Hare for the rest of his life. âNaggingâ before shooting The incident would unfold quickly. It started with a âdomestic quarrelâ at about 9 p.m. on Sunday, Dec. 15, 1963, according to contemporary reporting in the Minneapolis Morning Tribune. ADVERTISEMENT Agnes Winje, separated from her husband, had rented an apartment at the fourplex at 3025 Portland Ave. two months earlier. She and Hare were an item, and he was living with her, for all intents and purposes. According to police statements and court testimony at the time, a female acquaintance had been driving Hare to friends' homes and bars for drinks. Hare came back to the apartment, and that's when Winje started ""nagging"" him, he told police. He fired several shots into the kitchen wall of the first-floor apartment âjust to scare her,â Hare later said. Police would later find five bullets lodged in the kitchen wall. But when that didnât stop her ânagging,â Hare shot her several times with a .25 pistol. Winje suffered gunshot wounds in her upper chest and upper abdomen. A neighbor heard the shots and a womanâs moan, and quickly called police. When Hendricks and Langaard arrived, Hare met them with gun in hand. Winje was on the floor suffering severe blood loss. Hendricks, armed with a shotgun, said, âGive me your gun,â Langaard recalled, and Hare quickly fired three shots at the police officers. Hare later told police he didnât realize Hendricks was a police officer. Langaard returned fire, hitting Hare. ADVERTISEMENT In the aftermath, both Winje and Hare were taken to the hospital. Doctors, meanwhile, rushed to save Hendricks, but it was too late: He died on the ride to the hospital. The ambulance paused âoutside the hospital receiving room, then drove directly to the Hennepin County morgue,â the Tribune reported. âThe only comment I have to make, you couldnât print,â Minneapolis Police Chief E.I. Walling told reporters that night, his face flushed with anger, according to the Tribune. Hare comes to Minneapolis In the macho world of the blues, deals with the devil, casual violence and prison stints over men-and-women-done-wrong stories carried a certain cachet. Had he never killed two people, however, Hare would still be a notable musical figure. As a youngster in Arkansas, he learned some guitar, and he became proficient enough to begin playing with blues great Howlinâ Wolf (Chester Burnett) before Hare was 20 years old. Harmonica player Marion ""Little Walter"" Jacobs, left, and guitarist Pat Hare are seen performing at Smitty's Corner in Chicago in this 1959 photo by Jacque DemÃªtre. Hare in 1963 would shoot and kill Minneapolis Police officer James E. Hendricks and Hare's partner, Agnes Winje. Photo by Jacque DemÃªtre It was in Memphis where Hare made his name as a sideman on recordings by artists such as Rosco Gordon, James Cotton and others. ADVERTISEMENT Eventually, Hare graduated to the guitar chair in the Muddy Waters band â one of the most coveted assignments in the blues. Hare can be heard on legendary Waters recordings such as âForty Days and Forty Nightsâ (1956) and âGot My Mojo Workingâ (1957), among many others on the Chess Records label. Hareâs last recording with Muddy was one of the greatest: A seminal live recording called âMuddy Waters at Newport 1960.â It showcased Muddy and his crack ensemble at their best. Today, this album is considered an essential blues recording. Soon after, Hare would be lured to Minneapolis by another Muddy Waters associate, harmonica player George âMojoâ Buford. Buford had persuaded several Chicago blues artists to move to Minneapolis, helping to create an authentic blues scene in the Twin Cities. But Hareâs time in the spotlight â at least as a musician â would soon come to an abrupt end. Evolution of a song âIâm Gonna Murder My Babyâ was not an original musical idea of Hareâs. The song began life in the early 1940s as âCheating and Lying Blues.â It was written by the singer and entertainer Doctor Clayton (Peter Joe Cleighton) and released as a 78 record in 1941. In the few photos of Clayton that survive, he wears bold white, round glasses that highlight the knowing twinkle in his eyes. He was a professional musician, performing pop songs and blues alike, peppered with then-current references and slang. Tongue-in-cheek songs about relationship woes would certainly find receptive audiences in nightclubs and near jukeboxes. Claytonâs âCheating and Lying Bluesâ was a stop-time blues song, led by a walking piano style perfect for dancing. While the chorus is the same as sung by Hare, the verses are comical, and meant to elicit whoops and hollers: ADVERTISEMENT âBout three or four nights ago I had to work kinda late Somebody broke out my back door Like he was Supermanâs mate The song was covered by many blues artists, in many contexts, but its most famous iteration is as a song alternately called âGoinâ Down to Eliâs,â as performed by Robert Nighthawk (Robert Lee McCollum) and captured on the incendiary blues album âLive on Maxwell Street â 1964.â Nighthawk's sharp, keening slide guitar cuts through the crowd. Unlike Hareâs version, which picks up the story at trial, Nighthawk memorably begins at Eli's pawnshop: I went down to Eliâs To get my pistol out of pawn When I got back home My woman had gone âGoinâ Down to Eliâsâ became the version that most blues artists would reference and perform over the years. It wasnât until 10 years later, in 1974, that Hareâs unissued version, plainly called âIâm Gonna Murder My Baby,â was finally released on a black-market album called â706 Blues: A Collection of Rare Memphis Blues.â Long talked about in blues circles, the song became a favorite of collectors for its rarity, its innovative sound, and the sad-but-true story of Pat Hare. âGood morning judgeâ The killing of Officer James Hendricks shocked Minneapolis, still reeling from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy only three weeks earlier, on Nov. 22, 1963. Hendricks had been on the police force for only four years. The police department started a fund for his family, wife Betty, and his two young children, Kathy, age 12, and Jill, 10. âHe was very devoted to those two little girls of his, and when weâd stop, they would come running out and have a kiss for him,â his friend and partner Caywood Johnson remembered in a Dec. 17, 1963, Minneapolis Morning Tribune story. âHe really loved that.â Hendricks was laid to rest on Dec. 18, 1963, at Fort Snelling National Cemetery. Meanwhile, Agnes Winje was regaining consciousness and finally gave a statement to police. She said she saw Auburn Hare fire the shots that killed Hendricks, and corroborated much of the statement Hare had earlier given to police. âShe gave her side of the ânaggingâ business,â said Calvin Hawkinson, inspector of detectives. Though it seemed her condition had been improving, Winje died on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 1964, leading to a second murder charge against Hare. But his trial, unlike his boastful murder ballad, was routine. There was no âGood morning judge, and your jury too.â No âIâm gonna murder my baby, donât do nothing but cheat and lie.â The fiction of his song ripped away, without a guitar or a gun, Hare was convicted of first-degree murder on Feb. 19, 1964, and sentenced to life in prison. Hare pleaded guilty to third-degree murder in Winjeâs death, and received an additional 25 years on that count. Aftermath and legacy Pat Hare spent his remaining years in the Minnesota Correction Facility in Stillwater, where he started a band called Sounds Incarcerated. After his conviction, he would adapt his earlier statements to police. In a 1973 letter from Hare, published in 1991 in the magazine Juke Blues, Hare would claim that the police shot him first, and that Winje was caught in the crossfire with police. In a 1977 Star Tribune story about the prison band, Hare expressed his desire to be released and go back to music. âThatâs the only thing I do,â Hare said. âThat's a must.â Hare had one more turn in the spotlight for his musical talent, and not his criminal record. Hare was allowed â accompanied by a guard â to see his old bandleader, Muddy Waters, open for Eric Clapton in 1979 at the St. Paul Civic Center. Muddy invited Hare to the stage, and the two played together one last time. âYou got a lot of time to do, so you do it,â Hare said in a 1980 interview with the Twin Cities PBS show âWyld Ryce.â âYou donât try to do it two or three days at a time, you do it one day at a time. Just one. It turns out much better.â Just a few months after that program aired, Hare died of lung cancer on Sept. 26, 1980. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery in Stillwater, a quiet ending to a rowdy, distorted life. Hare was inducted into the Minnesota Blues Hall of Fame in 2015, in the âBlues Legacyâ category. Meanwhile, Hendricks is remembered annually on his end-of-watch anniversary, Dec. 15, by the Minneapolis Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.

On Wednesday, Dec. 13 at 7:36 p.m., Fontana police officers recognized a car previously identified in a report of a gun being brandished, and they attempted a traffic stop near Mango Avenue and Foothill Boulevard, authorities said in a news release. During the traffic stop the driver fled on foot, but police did not say at what point during the stop the pursuit started or how long it lasted. During the pursuit “the situation escalated,” which resulted in the officers firing on the man, according to the police statement. Fontana Police declined to comment on what happened that resulted in the escalation or if the man in question exchanged fire with police. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the shooting but also declined to comment. The man was wounded in the shooting. Officers provided medical aid on scene and he was transported to a local hospital, where he later died. His name has not been released pending notification of family. A gun was recovered at the scene of the shooting, according to the police statement. No officers were injured."

Alameda will pay $11 million to Mario Gonzalez’s 7-year-old son and another $350,000 to his mother ]to settle separate lawsuits in a death that drew numerous comparisons to the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. The eight-digit payout highlighted the “egregiousness” of the Alameda officers’ actions the day of Gonzalez’s death, said Julia Sherwin, who helped represent Gonzalez’s son. She said the payout appeared to be the largest settlement reached with a single child of someone killed by police in the state of California over the last decade. “It really sends a message that when the police violate people’s constitutional rights and cause the most extreme loss, which is the death of another human being, that they will be held accountable in court”,” Sherwin said. She pilloried the department for having waited until after Gonzalez’s death to implement reforms throughout the department mandating that officers immediately roll anyone placed in handcuffs onto their side, rather than leaving them on their stomach and at risk of asphyxiation. “They mishandled it from the start,” said Sherwin, noting how officers kept him pinned to the ground for nearly four minutes after handcuffing him. “This was just blatant violation of all generally accepted police training across the country.” In a statement, the city stressed that the settlements “shall not be construed as an admission by any party of liability or any fact that might give rise to liability for any purpose.” “The separate settlement agreements with the estate of Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Gonzalez’s mother, both of which are in the process of being finalized, are expected to provide that payment shall fully and forever discharge and release all claims and causes of action,” the city said. The city said it reached the settlements through its membership in the California Joint Powers Risk Management Authority. Once finalized, they will be funded through the authority, which worked with the city to manage the litigation and controls the funds. Gonzalez died on April 19, 2021, in a neighborhood near Scout Park after officers suspected he had violated a municipal code banning open containers of alcohol in public. Officers tackled Gonzalez when he resisted being handcuffed, according to police video, and pinned him to the ground for several minutes as he screamed and whimpered before falling unconscious. After Gonzalez’s death, police noted that a bottle of Canadian Mist whiskey in his possession had a security cap on it and opened a shoplifting investigation. The officers then travelled to at least five local stores on the day Gonzalez died in an attempt to find out whether Gonzalez stole four alcohol bottles that were found in his possession after the fatal struggle. The Alameda County coroner’s office later ruled Gonzalez’s death was a homicide, citing the “stress of altercation and restraint” but also noting the “toxic effects of methamphetamine,” “morbid obesity” and “alcoholism” as contributing factors. The three officers involved in his death — James Fisher, Cameron Leahy and Eric McKinely — were placed on paid administrative leave. Leahy and McKinely returned “into the workforce” in May 2022, a city spokeswoman said. Fisher left the department on Jan. 5 “after finding employment with another agency.” Alameda’s administrative investigation didn’t find any sustained violations among the officers who responded to the call about Gonzalez. Still, city leaders say they have taken several steps in the last couple years to improve the department, including hiring a civilian police auditor. Nancy O’Malley, the Alameda County district attorney at the time, declined to file charges against the officers. However, her successor, Pamela Price, announced plans in January to revisit the case. In December 2021, Gonzalez’s family sued the city and the officers, alleging that the city was negligent in its hiring and training of the officers. The civil complaint also claimed Gonzalez died from the officers’ “excessive force, improper restraint, mechanical asphyxia, and positional, restraint, and compression asphyxiation of him.” Gonzalez’s mother, Edith Arenales, also filed a federal suit against the officers in February 2022. Adante Pointer, the attorney for Gonzalez’s mother, said that the officers actions forever tainted the department. “Only time will tell whether the legal case, and this settlement, forces the department to change its ways,” Pointer said. The payout is among the largest for the Bay Area in recent years for a police killing. It follows a trend of municipalities and government agencies forking over increasingly expensive settlements in cases of alleged police misconduct after the numerous high-profile killings across the country in recent years, including $12 million by Louisville, Kentucky, for the killing of Breonna Taylor and $27 million by Minneapolis for Floyd’s death. Much of that appears owed to the growing number of police encounters caught on videotape — offering visceral and persuasive evidence for juries to consider, and a key incentive for cities to avoid taking a case to trial, said Annee Della Donna, an attorney based in Southern California. She recently helped litigate a $24 million settlement between the state of California and the relatives of 38-year-old Edward Bronstein, who died at the hands of California Highway Patrol officers in March 2020. “They’re seeing that the juries watching these videos are incensed,” Della Donna said, adding that government agencies “look at it as a business decision.” Unless police departments work harder at re-training officers on how to better respond to calls and not resort to violence, “the verdicts are just going to just keep going up,” she said, citing how “the public believes this probably happens every day in America — it’s just not always recorded.”"

Deputies from the sheriff’s Pontiac substation were patrolling the neighborhood at North Astor Street and North Pike Street at 9 p.m. Wednesday when they spotted a silver 4-door sedan suspected of being involved in a shots-fired incident at the Carriage Circle Apartment Complex over the weekend. Deputies made a traffic stop on the vehicle and approached the male motorist for questioning. He sped off, according to police. Deputies pursued the sedan while alerting other officers they were chasing a fleeing suspect. Police were able to stop the vehicle near Westway and Benson streets, a neighborhood on the city’s east side, just south of M-59. When the driver got out of the sedan, according to police, he abruptly turned toward deputies in what was described as a “two-handed posture.” Deputies fired on the suspect and then called EMS to the scene to treat the man, whose name has not been released. The man was declared dead at McLaren Oakland Hospital.’ The shooting happened in City Council President Mike McGuinness’ district. He said he expected residents to talk about this incident at next week’s council meeting. He said he was alerted to the shooting late Wednesday and spent much of Thursday morning talking to police about it. “Any loss of life is tragic and unnecessary and first I want to express my remorse for the breaking news that a man has died,” he said. “Because this is a shooting involving sheriff’s deputies, the city council will be eager to learn more about the particulars of the incident and make sure as much as possible is shared with the public.” The incident is currently being investigated by the Oakland County Sheriff’s special-investigations unit.

Name of the dead suspect, not released. Mesquite Police spokesman Lt. Brandon Ricketts tells us a lone officer working in the area of Faithon P. Lucas Blvd and Cartright tried to stop a suspected stolen vehicle. Ricketts says the officer noticed another, second vehicle appeared to be working alongside or following the suspected stolen vehicle, and attempted a stop. Six suspects in the two cars were apparently reluctant to stop, and Ricketts say it’s unclear if the suspects fired at the officer. At some point the officer fired at one of the suspects, who was killed; Ricketts says that suspect was armed with an AR pistol and body piercing armor. Other weapons were found in the suspect’s vehicle. Three suspects were arrested, but two others fled the scene, according to Ricketts, and a manhunt was launched involving a state police helicopter and canine officers. No description of the suspects are yet released. It’s expected more details may be released later today. (Copyright, All Rights Reserved, WBAP/KLIF 2023)"

A judge declared a mistrial Nov. 16 after the jury deliberated for several days but could not reach a unanimous decision. Hankison fired 10 shots the night of the deadly raid but did not strike anyone. His shots went into Taylor's apartment and into a neighboring unit, where a child was sleeping. Federal prosecutor Michael Songer said during a status conference that ""the government intends to retry the case."" A new trial would be the third attempt to prosecute Hankison for his actions the night of the March 13, 2020, botched raid that left Taylor dead. He was acquitted last year on state charges of wanton endangerment for shooting into Taylor's windows and a glass patio door. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings set a tentative trial date for October 2024, but noted that could change as prosecutors were interested in retrying Hankison in the summer. SEE MORE: Judge declares mistrial after jury deadlocks in trial of officer charged in Breonna Taylor case One of Hankison's lawyers is also retiring and he may choose to replace all his counsel, lawyer Jack Byrd told the judge. The 12-member, mostly white jury struggled to reach a verdict in Hankison's trial last month. At one point, the judge said there were ""elevated voices"" coming from the deliberation room and court security had to be brought in. Songer urged the judge to let the jury continue to deliberate, noting the ""enormous resources"" required to retry the case. In declaring the mistrial, Jennings said the jury members had a ""disagreement they cannot get past."" Hankison is the only officer who fired his weapon the night of the raid to be criminally charged. Prosecutors determined that two other officers were justified in returning fire after one was shot in the leg by Taylor's boyfriend."

The Austin Police Department issued a statement Wednesday, December 13, offering more insight into the fatal shooting of two women on the Southwest Side of Austin. The statement says body cam footage from a shootout between Shane James, who officers have charged with six murders, and Austin police officers will be released soon. James, 34, of San Antonio, is facing seven felony charges in Austin and is expected to face two murder charges in San Antonio after he allegedly went on what police are describing as a violent shooting spree that spanned from the Alamo City to the capital. According to Travis County court records, James is facing two counts of capital murder, two counts of capital murder of multiple people, two counts of aggravated assault against a public servant, and one count of aggravated assault in a mass shooting. Wednesday evening, APD released a statement further detailing an incident that reportedly occurred in the 5300 block of Austral Loop on the Southwest Side of Austin December 5. The statement says officers responded to a report of a burglary around 6:50 p.m. that day, arriving at an Austin home just a few minutes after the call. Advertisement Article continues below this ad More For You “The initial responding officer, who was wearing an Austin Police uniform, arrived at the location and encountered a male suspect in the backyard of the residence,” the Austin PD statement reads. “The male, later identified as Shane James, immediately fired several gunshots at the officer. The officer returned fire with his department-approved firearm in the direction of Mr. James. The officer suffered multiple gunshot wounds. The officer moved to the front of the house, where he found a second officer who assisted by providing cover. It was later determined that Mr. James was not struck by gunfire during this incident.” As EMS and the Austin Fire Department attempted to render aid to the officer shot, James reportedly drove off in a stolen vehicle at the home on Austral Loop, according to the statement from Austin PD. When officers pursued James, he crashed the stolen vehicle about 4 miles west of the home, which belonged to Katherine and Lauren Short, at the intersection of State Highway 45 and FM 1826. While officers were pursuing James on the reported 4-mile chase that ended the alleged shooting spree, officers entered the Short residence to discover both women had been fatally shot. Officers say these were James’s sixth victims, saying he started his shooting spree in San Antonio earlier that day when he fatally shot both of his parents in their San Antonio-area home on the far Eastside.

And this is a tragedy [that] such lovely people have been taken from us as a community, as a neighborhood, from their family,"" a neighbor of the Short family, Rebecca Lusk, told Austin TV news station KVUE.

They said William Barber II, 53, of St. Albans, was wielding a knife. Officers used a TAZER twice on Barber, which was not working, according to the KCSO. They said after this, officers from both departments shot Barber. Even though they performed life-saving measures, the man was pronounced dead just after 1 a.m. on Wednesday. They said Barber had “an extensive criminal history which includes a history of violence towards others and law enforcement.” The Kanawha County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the shooting.

ALBANS, W.Va. — Kanawha County police have identified the man who was shot and killed by officers Wednesday morning in St. Albans. The sheriff’s department said Thursday that William Barber II, 53, of St. Albans, had an “extensive criminal history which includes a history of violence towards others and law enforcement.” The department also released more specifics Thursday about what happened at the house on Lincoln Avenue. St. Albans police were dispatched there at 12:25 a.m. Wednesday after getting a call about a man wielding a knife at a woman. Nitro police officers were called to assist. A St. Albans officer was on the scene within four minutes of getting the call. Authorities said he encountered Barber with the knife and held him at gunpoint at 12:31 a.m. while a TAZER was requested. The TAZER was deployed twice after Nitro police arrived on the scene at around 12:33 a.m. The sheriff’s department said both deployments were ineffective and Barber continued to threaten with the knife. Three officers from St. Albans and Nitro fired their weapons at 12:34 a.m. and began lifesaving measures which lasted for nearly a half hour. Barber was pronounced dead at 1:02 a.m. Investigators said they’ve since learned that multiple 911 calls has come from the Lincoln Avenue residence this year and in previous years. An investigation into those calls is continuing. “Detectives are diligently working to complete a thorough and timely investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, the case will be submitted to the Kanawha County Prosecutor’s Office for final review,” a Thursday news release said."

A grand jury cleared Detective Mohammed Bashir in the Dec. 29, 2021, killing, the state Attorney Generalâs Office announced this week, saying the investigation showed the man was armed and had exchanged gunfire with Bashir. Thelonious McKnight Jr.âs death has been controversial in Paterson, with his family and community activists questioning whether he had a gun, though one was found near his body. Theyâve expressed distrust of the scandal-plagued police department and insisted the firearm could have been planted. âWeâre all devastated,â his sister, Janet Rodriguez, said Wednesday. âThe whole family is in shock now because it doesnât make any sense.â None of the officers involved were wearing body cameras, but prosecutors said a 9mm handgun and nine discharged shell casings from it were recovered close to McKnight. Lab tests revealed âparticles consistent with those found in gunshot residueâ on the cuffs of the sweatshirt he was wearing, prosecutors said. Nearly two hours before, McKnight and another man had been spotted on a police video surveillance camera at East Main and Hillman streets with what appeared to be handguns, prosecutors said. Officers had arrested the other man, who had a loaded gun, but couldnât locate McKnight at the time, prosecutors said. At about 8:40 p.m., McKnight was again spotted by police on East Main Street, with detectives in plainclothes stopping him after they arrived in an unmarked vehicle. Prosecutors said Bashir patted McKnight down, felt a firearm and called out âgunâ to alert the other officers. Prosecutors said police drew their guns, but McKnight ignored commands to show his hands and fled down a nearby alley. According to statements the officers gave investigators, McKnight ultimately drew a firearm and pointed it at another detective, who was just feet from him. Bashir saw McKnight pull the trigger, though the gun â which was equipped with a safety â did not go off, prosecutors said. Bashir opened fire, and he and McKnight exchanged gunfire, prosecutors said, with 14 rounds from Bashirâs 40-caliber gun also recovered at the scene. McKnight suffered multiple gunshot wounds. None of his shots struck anyone, prosecutors said. Since the shooting, McKnightâs death has been one of several rallying calls in protests against Patersonâs police department, which was taken over by Attorney General Matthew Platkin in March after years of problems. Platkinâs decision followed another police-involved killing, in which an anti-violence activist, Najee Seabrooks, was shot by officers during a mental health crisis. Mayor Andre Sayegh, who had long said McKnight pulled a gun on officers, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Rodriguez, McKnightâs sister, said the family does not accept the grand juryâs conclusion and will continue to press for justice for him. âWeâre not letting this go,â Rodriguez said. âWeâre going to do whatever we can to keep it relevant and fight as much as we can because we donât believe any of it.â Stories by Riley Yates Our journalism needs your support.

According to Canton police, just after 10 p.m. on Dec. 5, Officer Garrett Marino was flagged down by citizens reporting that a suspect had brandished a gun during an argument. Â A body camera video from the officer showed him confronting Zachary Fornash in the 800 bock of Alan Paige Drive S.E., on the property of the Skyline Terrace Apartments. During a 26-second foot chase, Officer Marino was heard saying, “get the [expletive] on the ground,” then saying “give me the air, he’s got a gun,” presumably requesting to use the open radio channel. As the chase continued, Officer Marino was heard repeatedly ordering Fornash to “get on the ground or you are going to get shot,” after which Fornash slowed to a walk. Marino then repeatedly ordered Fornash to “show me your hands.” Fornash appeared to be heard saying “no,” after which he turned and continues walking away. Marino then demanded that Fornash put his hands on his head. Without moving his hands from his waistline, Fornash appeared to turn to face the officer when Marino fired at least four shots. While laying fatally wounded on the ground, Fornash was heard telling the officer that his gun was a BB gun. On Thursday, Attorney Bobby DiCello called the shooting unacceptable, holding up photos from Fornash’s funeral. “I know people are going to say this is on Zachary because he didn’t stop walking. Ladies and gentlemen, that is not what the Constitution of the United States says,” said DiCello. “If you are allowed to carry a firearm in the United States, you ought not end in a casket for walking away from an officer, even if he believes you have one which he did not. He had a BB gun,” he added. DiCello is demanding a meeting between Police Chief John Gabbard, other city officials and members of the Fornash family. “I am not here for this family about a lawsuit. I am here to say to the cameras, to America, to this child and to you. We want a conversation and we want it, we demand it, we need it now,” said DiCello. DiCello’s firm is also representing the family of James Williams, 42, who was shot and killed by a Canton police officer on New Years Day in 2022 as Williams was firing celebratory shots into the sky from his backyard. Body camera video of that incident showed the officer firing shots through a privacy fence. Although the officer was absolved of any wrongdoing related to the shooting, DiCello’s firm has filed a wrongful death suit in that case against the city of Canton. That lawsuit continues to be litigated. “We are not objects, we are not targets, we are not threats. We are human beings,” said DiCello on Thursday, calling the two fatal shootings in less than two years a “pattern.” Although DiCello would not reveal specifics of what he wants to discuss with the city, he did cite several “technical problems,” including that “the officer involved took absolutely no chance, no effort to secure the safety of the scene. There was no gun battle, ladies and gentlemen, he was walking says his brother and friend.” DiCello said Fornash was “not perfect,” but he was a good person and he believes the officer could have started their confrontation trying to de-escalate the situation first. “When a body is seized with a bullet, it’s got to be because there is a lethal threat. Walking away from an officer and turning to him to respond to him is not a lethal threat,” said DiCello. Fornash’s shooting remains under investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which issued a statement to FOX 8 on Thursday saying the investigation remains active and, when completed, would be turned over to a prosecutor. In a written statement of his own last week, Chief Gabbard said the following: “I welcome the independent review of this incident and have confidence in the ability of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) to thoroughly and objectively investigate.

Attorney Carlos E. Moore, representing the family of Aderrien Murry says that despite the grand jury’s decision, the shooting was unjustified, and he will continue to pursue the case. The Murry family is also continuing to push for justice after finding out the officer involved in the shooting will not be charged. “The shooting of Aderrien Murry gained national attention as a heartbreaking example of the challenges faced by marginalized communities. The family, deeply affected by the trauma of the incident, is determined to seek accountability and justice through both state and federal court civil suits,” said Moore in a press release. Moore says that the pursuit of justice does not end with the grand jury decision. He claims that his legal team will continue to “exhaust all avenues available” to bring full transparency and accountability for those involved. “While the grand jury has spoken, we firmly believe that there are unanswered questions and that the shooting of Aderrien Murry was not justified. We are committed to seeking justice for Aderrien and his family, and we will persist in our efforts to ensure accountability through the civil legal process,” said Moore. A $5 million lawsuit was filed against the city of Indianola, the Indianola Police Chief, and the police officer who shot Aderrien Murry in May of 2023. Murry was hospitalized for five days after the shooting with a collapsed lung, lacerated liver, and fractured ribs. The incident came about after Aderrien’s mother called the police during a domestic dispute with her ex-boyfriend who had broken into her home on May 20. When police arrived, they reportedly kicked in the front door and told everyone inside the home to come outside with their hands up. Reports say that when Aderrien walked outside with nothing in his hands, an officer shot him in the chest. Moore previously identified the officer who fired the shot as Greg Capers, a 61-year-old sergeant who was named Best Officer in Indianola in 2021."

NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny identified the man as Kent Edwards, 43. Kenny said officers had gone to the apartment at 206 Eldridge St. to arrest Edwards, who they said was a suspect in an Upper East Side shooting, a strangulation in Queens and a sexual abuse case. They said he also had an active bench warrant for failing to register as a sex offender. Edwards, who state prison records show is Black, served 12 years in prison for attempted rape and selling drugs starting in October 2000. Police officials said Thursday that Edwardsâ mental state was under investigation. Attempts to reach Edwards' relatives were unsuccessful. Kenny said the Manhattan Violent Felony Squad tracked Edwards down at about 11:45 a.m. on Thursday morning at a small public housing unit in Lower Manhattan. Kenny said they found him by monitoring his phone, credit card and physically surveilling him. Edwards used to live in the Bronx but was âcouch surfing,â Kenny added. The officers knocked on the apartment door, where two women answered and said Edwards was locked in the bathroom with a 9mm gun, police officials said at a news conference. Police are investigating Edwardsâ relationship with the two women, officials said. The warrant officers then called in the NYPDâs Emergency Services Unit, who spent two and a half hours in the building hallway using police technology to get Edwards to leave the apartment, police said. First, the ESU â a specialized bureau deployed in highly-sensitive emergencies â sent in âscout,â a small police robot, which Edwards âimmobilizedâ with a blanket, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said. Then, officers flew in a police drone through the apartmentâs bedroom window, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Tarik Sheppard. Edwards knocked that down using a broom, Maddrey said. Next, police tried using a âpole camera,â which they couldnât get into the apartment, Maddrey said. Finally â after several hours â they sent in âAvatar,â a rolling NYPD robot equipped with a camera, which they followed closely behind, Maddrey said. â[The officers] did take a few steps in to try and close the distance and create better communicationâ with Edwards, Maddrey said. âI think once the avatar came in and he realized the officers were right there, he made a move and came out and fired at the officers.â Edwards shot at least three times at the officers, hitting two of their bullet proof shields and one officer in his bullet proof vest, according to police. One officer then shot Edwards twice, using a six-foot-tall police shield to âpin him down while other members were able to put him in handcuffs,â Maddrey said. EMS â who Maddrey said were already on the scene â âimmediately rendered aidâ and transported Edwards to Bellevue Hospital. Maddrey said he was pronounced dead at about 2:55 p.m. During the hours-long standoff, âthere was a lot of back-and-forth,â Maddrey said. â[Edwards] was asking for his sister, he was asking for medicine, he was making a lot of different requests.â Edwards told officers which sister he wanted to see, but they could not âget into communication with her,â NYPD Assistant Chief of Emergency Services Unit Carlos Valdez said at the news conference on Thursday. âHe asked for water, which we tried to provide and asked him to come out to receive the water â¦ but he refused to do that. He asked for medicine, which we said if we could get him into an ambulance we could provide â¦ but again he would not come out,â Valdez added. Asked by a reporter, Valdez said Edwards did not specify which medicine he wanted. Thomas Harrell, 46, lives across the street from 206 Eldridge St. and said police ordered people to clear the street on Thursday afternoon. He said he initially thought the gunshots were fireworks. âWhy would you have fireworks on a day this cold,â Harrell said in an interview. âIt didnât dawn on me until I came out to grab a soda and when I came out and I saw a whole crime scene.â Due to incorrect information provided by police, a previous version of this story listed the wrong address for the incident. It is 206 Eldridge St."

Jovanny Crespo contends that it was the responsibility of the state Attorney Generalâs office, and not the Essex County prosecutor, to investigate the Jan. 28, 2019 car chase through Newark in which Crespo fatally shot the driver, Gregory C. Griffin, and wounded the passenger, Andrew J. Dixon, after jumping out of his patrol car three times to open fire. In July, a jury in Essex County convicted Crespo of aggravated manslaughter, aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and official misconduct. He is currently awaiting sentencing in the Middlesex County Jail. In his motion to overturn his conviction, Crespo argues that the Attorney Generalâs office should have conducted the investigation, and that the trial should have been held outside of Essex County. The motion, which was filed by Crespoâs attorney, Isaac Wright, Jr., cites changes in state law that went into effect on Jan. 30, 2019, two days after the frenzied chase through Newarkâs Central Ward that left Griffin dead and Dixon with a bullet wound to the face. Wright argues that those changes should be applied retroactively to Crespoâs case. The Essex County Prosecutorâs Office disagrees. One change to the law requires the state Attorney Generalâs office to conduct all investigations in fatal police shootings and civilian deaths while in custody. The other holds that whenever a police officer is indicted for causing a personâs death, the trial should be held outside of the county where the incident occurred. âAt the very least, Defendantâs prosecution and trial before this Court was illegal,â Wright wrote in the motion filed last month in Essex County Superior Court. âAccordingly, the judgement of the jury in this case should be vacated and the indictment dismissed.â The New Jersey Legislature adopted the changes to restore public confidence in the integrity of investigations into police-involved shootings. But whether the changes should be applied retroactively to Crespoâs case is a question that the Essex County judge who presided over the trial, Michael Ravin, will consider in January. The deputy chief assistant prosecutor who worked the case for Essex County, Alexander Albu, answered Crespoâs motion in a letter to the judge last week. Albu wrote the language of the statute makes it clear that the changes were not to be applied retroactively. âThe Legislature specifically limited the application of these Statutes to âany personâs death occurring during an encounter with a police officerâ¦that takes place on or after the effective date [of January 30, 2019],â Albu wrote in the letter, which is part of the court record. âThe Legislature was thus clear that these provisions did not apply to this incident, which occurred on January 28, 2019.â Crespoâs trial began in May and lasted seven weeks. The issue was whether Griffin and Dixon, in a Chrysler 300 with a gun, ever posed an âimminent dangerâ to Crespo during a frenzied, late-night chase through Newarkâs Central Ward. Video of the five-minute chase was recorded on police dashboard and body cameras. During the chase, Crespo jumped out of his patrol car at three locations and opened fire. The prosecution argued that although there was a gun, the Chrysler was fleeing police and posed no âimminent dangerâ to Crespo or anyone else. The defense tried to convince the jury otherwise. The AG guidelines forbid shooting at a moving vehicle unless as a last resort to prevent death or serious injury to the officer or another person. Albu told the jury that it was highly unlikely that Crespo saw a gun pointed at him at all three locations, because it was dark outside and the car windows were tinted. Crespoâs motion also challenges video evidence of his testimony before the Grand Jury that Albu presented at the trial. Crespo claims that on the video, grand jurors are heard questioning Crespo about his motives, which he now claims prejudiced the trial jury. Crespo also claims that the judge erred by not allowing the jury to consider the lesser charge of passion/provocation manslaughter, which carries a much lighter sentence. A conviction of passion/provocation manslaughter would recognize that Crespo had no time to reflect during the chase and acted in the heat of the moment. Albu, in his letter to the judge, maintains Crespoâs actions were deliberate. A hearing before Judge MIchael Ravin will likely be held in January. Our journalism needs your support.

The proposed auction set off a stir, captured in more than 9,000 written comments from residents who opposed the idea that a âcrown jewelâ parcel and swath of big game corridor might be subdivided into 35-acre trophy home sites. The fervor cooled at last week's Board of Land Commissioners meeting with a swift motion by Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan DegenfelderÂ â one of the five elected officials who comprise the boardÂ â to table the topic until the fall of next year.

Our land and our people and our education are worth more than that.â The superintendentâs insinuation was that the parcelÂ â appraised at $62.4 millionÂ â is undervalued, and selling it to the feds at that price would leave Wyoming with the short end of the stick. Yet, the price was only one reason the board voted unanimously to table the auction, according to those familiar with proceedings, because what went unexpressed was the fear that the federal government would be outbid at auction. âA Saudi prince or somebody like that could spend $300 million to have a great view of the Grand Tetons and a major chunk of land right there. But the commercialization of the nice open space would detract from the overall view shed of the Jackson Hole Valley,â said Rep. Tom Walters, R-Casper, pointing out that the auction process requires the state to sell to the âhighest responsible bidder.â Different from other state lands, trust lands, which were granted to Wyoming upon statehood, are meant to provide revenue in order to finance a variety of public institutions referred to as beneficiaries, with the single largest beneficiary the Wyoming state school system. The OSLI is legislatively obliged to optimize revenue returns on trust lands â which is why the Kelly parcel, currently generating less than $3,000 annually from grazing leases, has become a target for disposal. âThatâs not my idea of a reasonable rate of return,â said Degenfelder. OSLI says profits from the sale of the parcel would generate more than $3 million annually once placed in its Common Schools Permanent Land Fund investment portfolio. However, many point out that the money is not necessarily needed, and that patience may better serve the stateâs long term interest. âThe state isn't not in need of funds currently. We have enough to operate the state government. So why sell it today when we don't need the cash? It's going to appreciate even faster, so if in 10 years the state is in a cash flow crunch, they can sell it then and capture the appreciation value,â said Rep. Walters, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee. Rather than put the parcel up for auction, Superintendent Degenfelder endorsed the concept of a land swap, with the goal of unlocking mineral developments on federal lands within Wyoming state lines. It would satisfy public interest in preserving the Kelly parcelâs wildlife migration and scenic functions while simultaneously delivering more money for public schools. That road, however, has been tried before to no avail. Administrators say that swapping the Kelly parcel will implicate a variety of land patches, agencies, and stakeholders, making for daunting bureaucratic negotiations. For instance, in the 2010âs, OSLI sought to swap its Teton county parcels for other federal lands, but because Grand Teton National Park park didnât have tradeable lands of equal value, the state turned to sister agency Bureau of Land Management (BLM). But negotiations only got harder. âIt's extremely difficult to get two agencies within that Department of Interior umbrella to work for a common purpose. Each has their own mission to pursue. So getting two entities or two agencies within the Department to work collaboratively and collectively on an exchange of the parcels within Teton County was an effort,â said Jason Crowder, Deputy Director of OSLI. Part of the difficulty relates to how fair values for swap are established, and how much weight to accord to a parcelâs potential subsurface mineral revenue. These were amongst the reasons the Interior Department discontinued swap negotiations in favor of a direct sale agreement. Following the Board of Land Commissionerâs decision last week to table the auction, pressure is building on state legislators to find a solution. And while a handful of representatives have expressed eagerness to tackle the problem, a legislative avenue has its own hurdles â including bad blood and ideological resistance. âI don't think the legislature is feeling very much love from the federal government right now,â said Rep. Walters, citing battles over the Rock Springs RMP and denied oil and gas leases. âAll those things are playing into this current situation. So I think there's a sentiment of: why would we want to do anything to help the federal government or be friendly with the federal government?â It underscores a major shift since former Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., sponsored the Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act in 2003. That act authorized the Board of Land Commissioners to authorize the direct sale of Teton County trust lands to the park. In 2010, the board entered an agreement that gave the Interior Department five years to acquire four separate parcels. By the time the legislation expired in 2016, however, the DOI had only acquired three, leaving the Kelly parcel behind. Subsequent attempts by the legislature to reauthorize a direct sale in 2016 and again in 2020 both failed. âI think there are some leaders that feel like [price] doesn't matter, and they're ideologically predisposed to not want the federal government to own anything else, and they're applying that ideology to Kelly parcel,â said Rep. Liz Storer, D-Jackson, speaking of the 2016 and 2020 failed conveyance efforts. Even though legislators are showing renewed interest in a direct sale solution, the topic is unlikely to be heard during the upcoming budget session, meaning a Kelly parcel bill wouldnât come until 2025. âThe likelihood of getting a [Kelly] bill through this session is pretty low because I think people are still all over the map,â Storer said. If the sale continues to be postponed, however, the price tag is certain to move higherÂ â legislators have begun floating a $100 million figureÂ â and the DOI could lose its appetite or decide to spend its acquisition allocations in other states. The DOIâs last Teton County acquisition of the Antelope Flats parcel in 2016 was enabled by a massive injection of private donations that came from the Grand Teton National ParkÂ Foundation, who helped raise as much as half of the total $46 million needed to purchase the parcel; without those private donations, the park would unlikely have picked up the parcel. As the sticker price moves northward on the Kelly parcel, the role of nonprofit donors like the GTNPF will become even more important. Though the foundation signaled its willingness to jump in and help convey the Kelly parcel, it still says resources are not unlimited. âPeople from across Wyoming voiced their opinion that itâs a really important parcel and hopefully we can make [a conservation status quo] happen. But there is a point at which too much is too much, and right now I don't know what that number is,â said Leslie Mattson, president of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. With a parcel surrounded on all sides by federal lands â including Bridger- Teton National Forest, Grand Teton National Park and the National Elk RefugeÂ â the federal government will inevitably be party to whatever solution leaders decide on. âThe people in the local and state offices of the BLM and the Forest Service have been good to work with. Obviously, they have mandates and processes given to them that they have to abide by, and that does create some hurdles, but we have a good working relationship with the individuals within the state offices,â said Jason Crowder, of OSLI, speaking about the prospect of land swap negotiations.

State:Â Â Florida Population Experiences Major Growth Florida’s population has been increasing exponentially in the last several years but is predicted to decrease as an older generation of people move to Florida. According to CBS, The Legislature’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research released a report this week that showed that the state’s estimated population in April was 22,634,867, an increase of nearly 359,000 people, or 1.61%, from a year earlier.

National:Â Â Biden Makes Ukraine Aid a Priority but Has to Deal with Immigration Predicament President Biden made funding Ukraine efforts one of his top priorities but now faces challenges with immigration policy. According to NBC, âI am willing to make significant compromises on the border,â Biden said in remarks on Wednesday. âWe need to fix our broken border system. It is broken. And thus far, Iâve gotten no response from Republicans.â Immigration advocates are worried that Biden may be swayed to avoid the basic rights of migrants looking to escape bad conditions at home for a better life in the U.S. Bidenâs need to help the community of Ukraine has left others supporting immigrants worried as the focus may remain strained. “The president can still turn this around,” said Rep.

(AP) — Federal prosecutors told a judge Wednesday they intend to retry former Louisville officer Brett Hankison after a jury deadlocked last month over charges he used excessive force the night Breonna Taylor was killed by police in 2020. A judge declared a mistrial Nov. 16 after the jury deliberated for several days but could not reach a unanimous decision. Hankison fired 10 shots the night of the deadly raid but did not strike anyone. His shots went into Taylor’s apartment and into a neighboring unit, where a child was sleeping. Federal prosecutor Michael Songer said during a status conference that “the government intends to retry the case.” A new trial would be the third attempt to prosecute Hankison for his actions the night of the March 13, 2020, botched raid that left Taylor dead. He was acquitted last year on state charges of wanton endangerment for shooting into Taylor’s windows and a glass patio door. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings set a tentative trial date for October 2024, but noted that could change as prosecutors were interested in retrying Hankison in the summer. One of Hankison’s lawyers is also retiring and he may choose to replace all his counsel, lawyer Jack Byrd told the judge. The 12-member, mostly white jury struggled to reach a verdict in Hankison’s trial last month. At one point, the judge said there were “elevated voices” coming from the deliberation room and court security had to be brought in. Songer urged the judge to let the jury continue to deliberate, noting the “enormous resources” required to retry the case. In declaring the mistrial, Jennings said the jury members had a “disagreement they cannot get past.” Hankison is the only officer who fired his weapon the night of the raid to be criminally charged. Prosecutors determined that two other officers were justified in returning fire after one was shot in the leg by Taylor’s boyfriend."

Emanuel Lopes appeared again in Norfolk Superior Court Thursday afternoon with his attorneys to argue out some motions in a hearing lasting more than an hour and a half ahead of a fresh trial date to begin next month. Lopes already faced trial in that same court for the shooting murders of Weymouth Police Sgt. Michael Chesna, 42, and bystander Vera Adams, 77, in the early hours of July 15, 2018, among 11 total related charges. That ended up being declared a mistrial on July 10, following weeks of jury deliberations that never amounted to a verdict. Lopes has remained without bail as attorneys battle out behind the scenes with a flurry of motions. Attorney Larry Tipton at the Thursday hearing argued for a continuance of the January court date to allow more time to get another expert to weigh in on Lopes’ criminal culpability on that chaotic night five years ago, but Judge Beverly J. Cannone denied the motion. The new trial will be held in Bristol County Superior Court in Taunton instead of at the Norfolk Superior Court, according to Thursday’s hearing. Taunton was chosen because, Cannone said, it’s far enough south that many in the jury pool would be more likely to get their news from Providence, R.I., than from Boston, leading to a more neutral pool. According to arguments in the previous trial, Lopes was having a rather ordinary day with a friend he was staying with, as well as that friend’s girlfriend and Lopes’ own girlfriend. But Lopes’ mood allegedly took an abrupt turn as the quartet had gone out to rent a movie from a local RedBox when he got a phone call from his girlfriend’s former partner. He then allegedly took his girlfriend’s white BMW, crashed it into another vehicle by South Shore Hospital and ran from the scene. Sgt. Chesna was the first to find him after an area resident called to complain that a rock had been thrown through the window. Prosecutors say that Chesna ordered Lopes to drop a large rock he was holding but that Lopes instead threw it at the police officer’s head and then allegedly walked over, grabbed Chesna’s service pistol and shot him five times in the head and chest. Another officer shot at Lopes through the police cruiser window, striking Lopes in the leg. Police would soon apprehend him and only then realize that 77-year-old bystander Vera Adams had been shot and killed in the mayhem as she sat on her nearby porch. The defense mounted a lack of criminal responsibility argument for Lopes, with defense attorney Larry Tipton arguing that his client has a long history of severe mental illness and often “ranted” about Martians, government conspiracies and the Illuminati and exhibited “symptoms of voices and shadows, people that weren’t there. Paranoia.”"

In a 4-0 vote Tuesday, the Board of Police Commissioners agreed with Chief Michel Mooreâs findings that Officers Diego Bracamontes and Christopher Guerrero were justified when they opened fire on 35-year-old Oscar Sanchez after responding to multiple 911 calls that he was throwing metal objects at passing vehicles. One commissioner, William Briggs, was absent from the vote. In a report summarizing the findings of an internal investigation, Moore stopped short of saying that Sanchezâs death could have been averted but questioned some of the officersâ tactical decisions leading up to the shooting, suggesting they missed opportunities to defuse the encounter. The LAPD says it needs helicopters. An audit found most flights arenât for âhigh priorityâ crimes L.A. City Controller Kenneth Mejia released the results of a months-long review of the Air Support Division, questioning âwhether the LAPD has justified the need for the programâs current size and scope.â Moore also said the officers should have consulted with the departmentâs mental health unit before approaching Sanchez. The chief said Sanchezâs decision to forcibly enter a nearby residence â combined with officersâ reasonable belief that he was armed â met the departmentâs definition of a âbarricaded suspect.â Instead of following him inside, Moore said, officers should have retreated and instead summoned the SWAT team and crisis negotiators to the scene. Sanchezâs death came amid a string of fatal Los Angeles police encounters involving men of color in the throes of mental health crises at the start of the year. In one incident, schoolteacher Keenan Anderson died several hours after an officer stunned him repeatedly with a Taser during an incident in which body-camera footage showed he was running through traffic and yelling incoherently. In another, police shot and killed Takar Smith, a 46-year-old man with schizophrenia who had barricaded himself inside a kitchen after officers ordered him to drop his knife. The Police Commission ruled there were multiple LAPD policy violations in the deaths of Anderson and Smith. The cases drew protests by activists who said the incidents underscored why armed police are ill-suited for dealing with people in distress. In the case of Sanchez, the report released Tuesday said officers responded on Jan. 3 to the area of 28th Street and Central Avenue after receiving calls about a man who had wrapped wire from a light pole around a large kitchen knife and thrown objects at passing vehicles. They tried to speak with Sanchez, but he disappeared into a second-story unit of a nearby building. A witness later told police that Sanchez lived there with another person, whose name and relationship to him were redacted from the report. The officers said they left without detaining Sanchez because they couldnât locate a victim and concluded that his âdemeanorâ suggested that any attempts to engage him would lead to use of force. They were dispatched back to the location about half an hour later when another 911 caller reported a man matching Sanchezâs description had thrown something at his vehicle. Sanchez again ignored the officersâ commands, in Spanish and English, and walked back up to the second-story unit. Pacing back and forth on a landing outside, he complained in Spanish about the flashlights being shined on him and yelled, âYouâre not going to rob me, idiot.â In the wake of a gang unit scandal and concerns about officers misconduct, LAPD leaders are considering whether to use artificial intelligence to analyze vast troves of officer body-cam footage. Sanchez began trying to force his way into the unit, prompting a supervisor on the scene, Sgt. Edward Asawesna, to order officers to go in after Sanchez if he managed to get inside. The shooting occurred as officers entered the unit, with Bracamontes and Guerrero each firing three rounds. Almost simultaneously, another officer, Carlos Manzo, shot at Sanchez with a projectile from a 40mm âless lethalâ launcher used by police to subdue suspects; itâs unclear whether that round struck him. Sanchez was pronounced dead at the scene. Bracamontes said in an interview with department investigators that Sanchez was holding what appeared to him to be a âharpoon gunâ or a homemade spear with a sharp point, and in what Bracamontes described as a fighting stance. Asawesna said he didnât see any weapons in Sanchezâs hand, according to the chiefâs report. Moore was critical of Asawesnaâs actions at times during the incident, agreeing with a department force review board in that the sergeant exhibited poor judgment in ordering officers to follow Sanchez onto the narrow landing where they had âlimited redeployment options.â Moore said he was pleased with the initial tactics employed by Bracamontes and Guerrero, pointing out that they discussed the nature of the call while en route, as officers were trained to do, and conceived a plan before approaching Sanchez. Sgt. Asawesna, he notes, also ensured that all officers present were assigned proper roles. But Moore agreed with a majority of the review board, which faulted Bracamontes and Guerrero for failing to recognize this as a barricaded suspect situation. As seasoned officers, they should have known to fall back and call for backup, he said. The Los Angeles Protective Leagueâs Jamie McBride wrote a recent column in the unionâs monthly newsletter accusing the department of lowering its standards on beards and hair. A minority of the board pointed out that officers often respond to radio calls with only vague information to go on, and that disobeying Asawesnaâs orders to pursue Sanchez into the building could have been grounds for insubordination. Earlier this year, Sanchezâs family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the two officers and the city, contending that officers had no cause to confront Sanchez when he was going into his home and posed no threat to them or anyone else. âItâs not clear how they could find that an officerâs use of deadly force was justified in the case when they find that a man was unarmed, that a man was mentally ill and the man was in his own home,â said attorney Christian Contreras, who filed the suit on behalf of Sanchezâs family. âBut again itâs not a surprise when this is essentially the police policing themselves.â Contreras said that Sanchezâs family is still grieving and that the shooting could have been prevented if the officers hadnât âagitatedâ Sanchez and escalated the confrontation. The city has denied any wrongdoing in the civil case, which is set to go to trial in February 2025. Bracamontes was involved in another fatal on-duty shooting at the Ford Hotel on July 20, when he and another officer opened fire on a 56-year-old Black man named Billy Stribling who police said raised a knife over his head as he advanced toward the officers. Stribling was also struggling with mental illness. The commissionâs ruling on the Sanchez case comes amid an ongoing debate about the role police should play in responding to emergency calls involving people suffering from mental illness. Activists have argued that alternative mental health providers would be better equipped to respond to certain calls for help. LAPD officials have agreed in the past but maintained that incidents in which a weapon is present necessitate an armed response. The department has sought to expand coverage of its Mental Evaluation Unit â which pairs officers with county social workers trained in de-escalating standoffs with people thought to be mentally ill â but officials have said a shortage of clinicians has made this difficult. A separate mobile response team that is made up entirely of unarmed mental health workers continues to expand, most recently to several neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley. Proponents have long argued that such programs, and more community-led efforts, remain underfunded.

The officer had reportedly followed a white pickup truck reported stolen from Irving. Dunn was exiting his cruiser as Moreno was pulling out of a parking lot. Farmers Branch police had been monitoring Moreno, suspected of stealing the pickup truck from Irving. During the trial, Dunn testified that he felt his life was in danger as Moreno was driving toward him while he exited his police vehicle. Police stated that officers were attempting to arrest Moreno for auto theft, but he ignored commands and tried to escape. Dunn opted for a judge to hear the trial, and on Wednesday, Judge Mike Snipes acquitted him after deliberating for less than half an hour. Dunn, who had been on administrative leave since the shooting, could have faced a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted. Farmers Branch Police Chief Kevin McCoy released the following statement on today's verdict in the Michael Dunn case: ""An officer-involved shooting is one of the most difficult situations faced by a police department, and any incident involving deadly force and the loss of life is tragic regardless of the circumstances. Our Department values every human life and works diligently to avoid using deadly force at all times. On behalf of the entire Farmers Branch Police Department, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Moreno family for the loss of their loved one on the evening of June 12, 2019. Now that Officer Dunn’s criminal trial has concluded, the Department’s Internal Affairs Division will move forward with a separate investigation regarding the same incident. Officer Dunn has been on administrative leave since the incident in 2019, and will remain on leave pending the outcome of the internal review process. The purpose in this and every investigation conducted by the Farmers Branch Police Department is to act with integrity and transparency in our constant effort to maintain the trust of the public we serve."" Moreno's family had previously initiated a civil suit against Dunn and the Farmers Branch Police Department. However, the civil action was put on hold pending the outcome of the criminal case."

Officer Eleazar Alejandro and Sgt. Alfred Flores face a charge of murder. Officer Nathaniel Villalobos faces a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant in connection with the death of Melissa Perez, Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales said at a news conference Thursday. All three men are scheduled to be arraigned in the 187th District Court in January. Gonzales said, “It’s difficult to prosecute a member of law enforcement” but added, “No one is above the law.” He commended SAPD Chief William McManus for filing the charges, saying, “It was the right thing to do.” McManus previously said the officers didn’t follow department training or policy and “used deadly force, which was not reasonable given all the circumstances as we now understand them.” Perez was experiencing a mental health crisis and had a hammer in her hand when police shot her through a patio window and door in the 6200 block of Old Pearsall Road, McManus previously said. “Mental health is a serious issue in the community,” Gonzales said. “When someone suffers, it requires us to step back, especially those in the community who have to make split-second decisions.” Dan Packard, attorney for the Perez family, said it’s an emotional day for her surviving children. He added that the city needs to take responsibility for the lack of training their officers receive on mental health calls. “Multiple officers who were on the scene had had prior dealings with Melissa Perez, and they knew she was schizophrenic and yet they treated her like she was a dangerous criminal,” Packard said. “Why didn’t somebody else speak up and say, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let’s calm down. Let’s stand down.’ And so there needs to be training about how to intervene whenever some other officer has completely lost his head.” The department released a portion of edited and blurred body-worn camera video from officers on the scene after the shooting. DA Gonzales said he’s hopeful for “better training for law enforcement” to handle similar situations. “Ninety-nine percent of SAPD do an outstanding job, (but) when 1% fails to work within the law, they must be held accountable,” Gonzales said. Villalobos’ attorney, Nico LaHood, issued the following statement: “The reduction in the charging document handed down by the Grand Jury does not change our position that Nathaniel is innocent of this allegation. We believe a clear minded analysis of all the circumstances surrounding this incident will support our position.” Alejandro’s attorney, Ben Sifuentes, sent KSAT the following statement: “Mr. Del Prado and I are honored to represent Eleazar Alejando. Chapter Nine of the Texas Penal Code provided the police officers complete justification for their conduct.” The San Antonio Police Officers’ Association sent the following statement in response to the indictment: “Today, three San Antonio police officers involved in the death of Melissa Perez were formally indicted following a thorough 6-month investigation. We anticipate a comprehensive and fair judicial trial process.” Andy Segovia, San Antonio city attorney, issued the following statement: “Given the indictments we will let the criminal process run its course and not add substantive comment.”"

Gonzalez died in Alameda police custody in April after being restrained face down to the ground. The city will also pay $350,000 to Mario Gonzalez's mother. This is a breaking news update. Previous article follows. The death of Mario Gonzalez in April as he was being restrained by Alameda police employees has been ruled a homicide by the Alameda County coroner's bureau, city officials said Friday. On April 19, Alameda police responded to a call for a disorderly person in a public park. Police body camera video showed officers pinned Gonzalez face down to the ground for approximately 6 minutes and 17 seconds. RELATED: Alameda PD releases bodycam video showing moments leading up to in-custody death of 26-year-old man The newly released Alameda County Coroner's Autopsy Report concludes the cause of death for Gonzalez is the ""toxic effects of methamphetamine"" with other significant conditions as the ""physiologic stress of altercation and restraint, morbid obesity and alcoholism."" The manner of death is classified as a homicide. ""My heart goes out to the Gonzalez family...I am committed to a thorough investigation,"" said Alameda Police Chief Nishant Joshi during an interview with ABC7 News. Chief Joshi says he's reviewed the autopsy report. ""This is information that I think people want to know however this information doesn't tell me doesn't get me to a completed investigation it just helps get us closer to completing the investigation,"" said Joshi. Attorney Michael Haddad is representing Gonzalez's son. EXCLUSIVE: New Alameda police chief shares message for family of man killed by officers ""Mario would not have died but for the prone restraint these officers inflicted on him,"" said Haddad. While Attorney Adante Pointer is representing Gonzalez's mother. ""Despite what some of the contributing factors may have been around him either being intoxicated or his state of health the fact is clear that he would be here today if not for his interaction with the police,"" said Pointer. Both are now calling on the Alameda County District Attorney to evaluate the case as a homicide and consider bringing charges against the officers.

The Alameda police chief says the officers involved remain on paid administrative leave. The four police employees involved in Gonzalez's death are Officer James Fisher, hired by the city in 2010; officers Cameron Leahy and Eric McKinley, hired by the city in 2018; and parking enforcement employee Charlie Clemmens. According to Chief Joshi it is up to the Alameda District Attorney's Office to determine whether charges are appropriate against the officers involved. ""While we wait for the District Attorney's office to make their decision and with the knowledge of the Coroner's report, the City will work diligently towards completing its ongoing independent investigation and take appropriate action,"" said Chief Joshi.

Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch says her office will take no further action against Sgt. Greg Capers, the officer who shot Aderrien Murry. In a statement released Thursday, Fitch says her office completed its review into the May 20 incident involving Capers in Indianola, Miss., and presented it to the grand jury in Sunflower County, Miss., on Wednesday — which then handed up the decision. ""As such, no further criminal action will be taken by this Office in this matter,"" Fitch said. Carlos Moore, the attorney representing the family of Aderrien Murry, told NPR that despite the grand jury's decision, the shooting was not justified and he will continue to pursue the case. ""We are committed to seeking justice for Aderrien and his family, and we will persist in our efforts to ensure accountability through the civil legal process,"" Moore said in a statement to NPR. Aderrien's mother, Nakala Murry, is asking for the body camera footage from the incident to be released publicly. ""Watching that footage was nothing I was prepared for emotionally, but it was something I had to do,"" she said during a Wednesday press conference, Mississippi Today reports. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which was investigating the shooting alongside the attorney general's office, did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Capers' attorney, Michael Carr, said Capers is relieved at the decision and is ""looking forward to getting back to work."" The move from the Mississippi Attorney General's Office comes nearly seven months after Murry was left seriously injured after Capers shot him in the chest responding to a 911 call that Murry had made. Nakala Murry said she told her son to call the police after the father of one of her other children came to their home in the early hours of May 20 in an ""irate"" mood. After arriving at the Murry family home, police instructed everyone inside to come out with their hands up. Nakala Murry says that's when the 11-year-old emerged from around a corner, running toward the door. Capers then opened fire, according to the family. Following the incident, Murry suffered a collapsed lung, fractured rib and lacerated liver. In May, his family filed a $5 million federal lawsuit, which argues that the police officers who responded to the domestic disturbance call acted in a way that was ""so outrageous that it shocks the moral and legal conscience of the community."" The lawsuit names the city of Indianola along with the two police officials as defendants. The suit accuses the police department of gross negligence and reckless disregard, in addition to failing to train and supervise its officers properly. In the suit, the family called for Capers and Indianola Police Chief Ronald Sampson to be fired, as they have repeatedly asked for body camera footage of the incident to be released.

According to Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, the NYPD Warrant Squad tracked alleged 43-year-old sex offender Kent Edwards to 206 Eldridge St just before noon on Dec. 14. Chief Maddrey said that Edwards had been wanted for an October shooting in which he shot a man in the left leg. Edwards, who resided in the Bronx, apparently locked himself in the 2nd floor bathroom of a female resident with whom he had a relationship, sources said. Fleeing the building, the woman told police that Edwards had barricaded himself inside with a pistol. âThey [NYPD ESU] establish contact with the wanted male, they’re having conversations with the male and they’re just taking the time talking to him trying to get him to surrender peacefully,â Chief Maddrey said. Police swiftly cordoned-off the area and hurriedly evacuated pedestrians underway while the impasse unfolded. Over the course of several hours, Edwards allegedly made several demands including requesting water, medicine, and to speak with his sister, who the NYPD say they could not contact as officers bearing assault weapons stood poised outside the apartment building, fixated on the window of the residence where the gunman was holed up. Other armed NYPD personnel, lugging riot shields went into the apartment attempting to negotiate a peaceful end to the impasse. Police deployed a drone, which Edwards is said to have destroyed by swinging a broom at the device. Next police unleashed what they dubbed an avatar, a remote-control land drone. However, after nearly two hours and 30 minutes, when Edwards spotted the avatar, he came out firing. âWe believe four shots he fired. He struck a small shield one time, he struck one of our larger bunkers twice, and one of our members from ESU took a projectile to his bulletproof vests,â Chief Maddrey said. âOur officers were able to return fire, they fired twice striking the male.â Police say they used one of the heavy duty shields to subdue Edwards. Four or five gunshots could be heard blasting from outside at just after 2 p.m. Mere minutes later, the alleged gunman, now wounded, was whisked away on a stretcher by first responders. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Several of the ESU officers were also taken to a local hospital for evaluation, police sources said. According to Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny, has 11 prior arrests dating back to 1995, that included a shooting and strangulation. He was last arrested on Feb. 23 of this year on a rape charge. He also had an active warrant for failing to register as a sex offender, cops say.Â"

According to an incident report, Officer Juan Morin was sent to the Sol Apartments for an assault call on Nov. 19. A couple called police after they said a 49-year-old man parked their car and waved hi to him, according to a report. KSAT is not identifying the man since he has not been charged with a crime. The couple told police the man hit their car with his fist. They rolled down a window and said the man punched the driver, according to the report. Morin then approached the man, who was walking a dog. The video shows the man getting upset, telling Morin that the couple lied. âThe officer had used his verbal skills in order to try to talk to the suspect,â Police Chief John Jahanara said. âObviously, that wasnât working, then deployed his Taser.â Jahanara said the Taser did not work on the man, but said it appeared to have triggered the dog. The body camera video shows the dog running towards Morin. âYou better get him!â Morin shouted. The dog ran towards Morin again, who then is shown shooting the dog twice. The dogâs owner was detained and shouted, âHe killed my dog!â Jahanara, who owns a dog himself, said the video is tough to watch. âShe gave her life for her owner,â he said. Morin was placed on administrative leave for two weeks as the incident was investigated, Jaharana said. âWe treated it as a officer-involved shooting, no different than if my officer would have shot the suspect or the owner,â he said. Jaharana said there are no guidelines on how to handle a case like this, which is why heâs looking into implementing a new policy. As for the man who owns the dog, Jaharana said he has a mental illness and is being treated for it. He said the man has come to terms with what happened to his dog. âHe wanted the collar and the leash,â Janarana said. âHe understood. He was sorry for his actions.â"

When the police arrived at the residence, they were told that Brown had fired several shots inside the house. While officers were talking to a woman who lives in the home, Brown stepped out onto the balcony and pointed the gun at the officers. She then retreated back inside the house. The officers proceeded to kick down the front door andÂ found Brown standing on a bed in the living room, pointing a gun at a young childÂ who was sitting on the bed. The officers fired several rounds at Brown, but she refused to drop the gun. They opened fire again and then rushed to grab the toddler, who was unharmed. Officials said Brown died from her injuries at the scene. Investigators said that Brown was not related to the child or the family and are trying to determine a motive for what happened.

Johnson extended “sincere condolences to the Murray family as they grieve their loss” at Tuesday’s (Dec. 12) village board meeting. Officers were dispatched to the 200 block of Fern Drive shortly before 4:30 p.m. Friday, Dec. 1, for a report of a man with a knife. A previous statement issued by the village said officers were dispatched to a domestic situation and encountered a man with a knife. That man was later identified as Jack Murray, 24, of Chicago. “Responding officers attempted to keep Mr. Jack Murray in the house by providing instructions via the 911 call taker, who relayed those instructions to an individual inside the residence,” said Johnson. “Murray exited the residence. Our officers were staged several houses away. Mr. Jack Murray advanced toward our officers while holding a knife approximately 11-1/2 inches in overall length. “As he continued to advance toward the officers, Mr. Jack Murray ignored numerous commands to put the knife down and commands to put his hands up. “As [he] came into close proximity to our police officers, they deployed a Taser…as a less lethal option. “After the Taser was deployed, he continued to advance toward officers and was still holding the knife at the time lethal force was applied. Officers started first aid and emergency life-saving measures until paramedics took over.” Johnson’s statement discussed officer training generally, and the type of training the officers responding had. Within the hour of Johnson’s statement, attorney Antonio Romanucci, representing the family of Murray, issued a statement on behalf of the family in response to Johnson. The family lives in Elk Grove Village. Romanucci previously raised the view that officers who dealt with Murray before should have been able to contain the situation without the use of lethal force. “Over the years, the village has placed a priority on ensuring that Elk Grove Village police officers have the resources and training they need to respond to the variety of situations presented to them on a daily basis,” Johnson continued. “Elk Grove Village police officers who responded to the incident…had a combination of crisis intervention team (CIT) training, mental health training, and de-escalation training, all of which were utilized during the response to this incident.” Johnson concluded, “This is all the information we can share at this time,” and would not answer follow-up questions by reporters on the details of those events, nor discussion of subsequent follow-up communications with Murray’s family. Romanucci held a press conference on Dec. 4 calling for more information to be released, renewing those calls in a statement issued Tuesday evening after Johnson. Romanucci also said Johnson refused a request to meet with the family before releasing more details of the incident publically. Tuesday night, Johnson said more information would be forthcoming. “The village understands and respects the desire for information and transparency for the community to better understand the events that took place,” Johnson said. “We will share the audio from 911 dispatch, as well as the audio and video footage from the officers’ body-worn cameras and police vehicle cameras, as soon as we can.” Romanucci said in a written statement: “We are beyond disheartened by Mayor Johnson’s statement tonight to the Elk Grove Village Board and to the public about the police shooting death of Jack Murray. The mayor, who refused our request in a letter yesterday (Monday) to meet with the family, chose to share a detailed narrative of what he says transpired without providing any proof to substantiate it. “We asked the mayor yesterday to speak with the family before making any public statement on this case and all we received in response was a call that the mayor has retained an attorney. Imagine being a grieving parent or sibling and hearing a statement like that read in a public forum while you are desperate for details about how your loved one died. We find that shameful.” He continued, “We are deeply concerned that the mayor would share any detail from this tragedy with the public before meeting privately with the grieving family. We would all want our loved ones to be given that respect. We will not go away. We demand the immediate release of the 911 call and the body and dash cam video the mayor referenced, and we state firmly that the decent thing to do would be to allow this grieving family of Elk Grove Village residents to view all of this in privacy first. That transparency and courtesy is the right thing to do for this family and for the community.” The Journal & Topics also filed an order for public documents for more information regarding the Dec. 1 shooting on Monday, Dec. 4. Public bodies such as the village must respond to FOIA document orders within five business days, but may request additional time to fulfill those document orders. On Monday, Dec. 11, after 5 p.m. Elk Grove Village officials responded to the Journal’s FOIA asking for an extension until Monday, Dec. 18. Village officials cited the substantial number of records, which would need to be collected and examined. Five Elk Grove Village police officers who responded to the Dec. 1 incident remained on paid leave Tuesday, which police said is standard procedure when there is a fatal use of force.Support local news by subscribing to the Journal & Topics in print or online."

It continued later that 1986-87 season with Freddie Banks and Armen Gilliam leading the Rebels to the Final Four against Indiana. We all wanted to shoot the ball like Freddie and dominate the inside like “The Hammer” Gilliam. The love strengthened in the mid-1990s as a student, when being part of the UNLV community helped shape the ideals many of us Rebels still live by. We learned to be part of the solution, welcoming to all, and were given the tools to do our part in making the world a better place. We live by a simple standard: If you are a Rebel, you are family. Our family, unfortunately, is hurting. A shooter police described as a failed job candidate in the Lee School of Business took the cowardly action last week of killing three professors on campus and seriously injuring a fourth before being killed by police. The active shooter call late Wednesday morning brought great fear to students and staff, some of whom were locked in shelter for hours with their minds wandering. Thankfully, no students were physically injured or killed. But many suffered mental wounds that won’t soon be healed, prompting university officials to make the easy decision to cancel this week’s final exams. Nobody wants to be back at the scene of terror, where they would surely relive those somber minutes and hours of uncertainty wondering if they would survive. “I won’t sugarcoat it. We are all hurting right now,” UNLV President Keith Whitfield said last week. “But it’s in these trying times that we need to lean on one another for support.” Today marks one week since the shooting, and Whitfield is right, the support of fellow Rebels and those who love the UNLV community has been overwhelming. There have been vigils, monetary donations, people opening their business to students, prayers, moments of silence and more. My local big box chain Thursday had empty racks of UNLV gear, when usually those items sit untouched for weeks. The professors lost — Jerry Cha-Jan Chang, Patricia Navarro Velez, Naoko Takemaru — were great educators who had long been part of the UNLV community. And what made them great wasn’t how well they performed their jobs. Stories have emerged detailing how they were even better members of the community and took pride in looking out for others, especially those young adults they teach. Remember, college students are usually age 18-22, and living away from home for the first time. Take Takemaru, who taught Japanese in the College of Liberal Arts. She almost exclusively spoke to her students in Japanese, but when former student Steven Gonabe had a family issue, she gently switched to English and told him “my door is always open. You can always talk to me,” he told the Sun’s Hillary Davis. “She really pushed the students,” Gonabe said. “If you had a passion for it, she would guide you.” Chang, who studied the impact of information technology, human-computer interaction, organizational learning and software piracy, loved the university so much that he donated his body to it for research, officials said. Navarro Velez, 39, worked for one of the world’s largest public accounting firms before joining UNLV in 2019 as an accounting professor. She had four children. And she treated all in the Rebel community as if they were family, colleagues say. “Her lasting legacy is one of a wide circle of friends who through her influence and love, and through this experience, today, find themselves as family,” said Jason Smith, chair of the accounting department. The family feel that Navarro Velez brought to UNLV is something many of us have long felt when at home on the Maryland Parkway campus. A shooter who tried to destroy our community because he couldn’t be part of it has done the complete opposite. He’s made us stronger. He’s intensified our love for each other and brought it to the forefront. UNLV has and always will be a destination university. It’s in one of the world’s premier cities, has noted research and programs, and gives many first-generation students a place to obtain the tools to achieve their dreams. The tragedy will go down as one of the worst days in UNLV history. But it’s also a turning point in making our community stronger. UNLV is already getting back up, and ready to continue with its mission of creating the next generation of leaders."

What went wrong? When Barbara and Belvett Richards learned that the police had killed their son, they couldn’t understand it. How, on that September day in 2017, did their youngest child come to be shot in his own apartment by officers from the New York Police Department? Miguel Richards, who was 31, grew up in Jamaica and had moved to New York about a year earlier after coming to the United States through a work-study program. His father’s friend gave him a job doing office work, and he rented a room in the Bronx. But he started to struggle, becoming reclusive and skipping days of work. His mother, with whom he was particularly close, pleaded with him to return to Jamaica. “It’s as if I sensed something was going to happen,” she says. “I was calling him, calling him, calling him: ‘Miguel, come home. Come home.’” His parents knew he had never been violent, had never been arrested and had never had any issues with the police. What details they managed to gather came from the Bronx district attorney: Richards’s landlord, who hadn’t seen him for weeks, asked the police to check on him. The officers who responded found Richards standing still in his own bedroom, holding a small folding knife. And 15 minutes later, they shot him. Richards’s death marked a historic turning point. It was the first time a killing by officers was recorded by a body camera in New York. The new program was announced just months before as heralding a new era of accountability. Now, a week after the shooting, the department posted on its website a compilation of footage from four of the responding officers. The video, the department said in an introduction to the presentation, was produced “for clear viewing of the event as a totality.” And as far as the department was concerned, the narrative was clear. Sometimes “the use of deadly force is unavoidable,” the police commissioner at the time, James O’Neill, wrote in an internal message. The level of restraint shown by all officers, he said, is “nothing short of exceptional.” And, he added, “releasing footage from critical incidents like this will help firmly establish your restraint in the use of force.” Richards’s parents were not convinced. Belvett watched footage at the district attorney’s office. What he saw, and what was released, did not, in fact, show that the use of deadly force was unavoidable. He later learned that the department had not released all the footage. What else didn’t they know about their son’s death? When body-worn cameras were introduced a decade ago, they seemed to hold the promise of a revolution. Once police officers knew they were being filmed, surely they would think twice about engaging in misconduct. And if they crossed the line, they would be held accountable: The public, no longer having to rely on official accounts, would know about wrongdoing. Police and civilian oversight agencies would be able to use footage to punish officers and improve training. In an outlay that would ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the technology represented the largest new investment in policing in a generation. Yet without deeper changes, it was a fix bound to fall far short of those hopes. In every city, the police ostensibly report to mayors and other elected officials. But in practice, they have been given wide latitude to run their departments as they wish and to police — and protect — themselves. And so as policymakers rushed to equip the police with cameras, they often failed to grapple with a fundamental question: Who would control the footage? Instead, they defaulted to leaving police departments, including New York’s, with the power to decide what is recorded, who can see it and when. In turn, departments across the country have routinely delayed releasing footage, released only partial or redacted video or refused to release it at all. They have frequently failed to discipline or fire officers when body cameras document abuse and have kept footage from the agencies charged with investigating police misconduct. Even when departments have stated policies of transparency, they don’t always follow them. Three years ago, after George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers and amid a wave of protests against police violence, the New York Police Department said it would publish footage of so-called critical incidents “within 30 days.” There have been 380 such incidents since then. The department has released footage within a month just twice. And the department often does not release video at all. There have been 28 shootings of civilians this year by New York officers (through the first week of December). The department has released footage in just seven of these cases (also through the first week of December) and has not done so in any of the last 16. Asked about the department’s limited release of footage, a spokesperson pointed to a caveat, contained in an internal order, that footage can be withheld because of laws or department policy. “The N.Y.P.D. remains wholly committed to its policy of releasing such recordings as quickly and responsibly as circumstances and the law dictate,” the spokesperson wrote. “Though transparency is of the utmost importance, so too is the Police Department’s commitment to preserving privacy rights.” The department did not say which policies require the withholding of footage and did not address other questions about its record on the cameras. (Mayor Eric Adams’s spokesman did not make him available for comment.) For a snapshot of disclosure practices across the country, we conducted a review of civilians killed by police officers in June 2022, roughly a decade after the first body cameras were rolled out. We counted 79 killings in which there was body-worn-camera footage. A year and a half later, the police have released footage in just 33 cases — or about 42 percent. This article is the product of more than six months spent investigating how the police have undermined the promise of transparency and accountability that accompanied the body-camera movement. We interviewed dozens of department insiders, government lawyers, policing experts and advocates and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal reports, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and dozens of hours of surveillance-camera and body-camera footage, including some that the New York Police Department fought against disclosing. The reporting reveals that without further intervention from city, state and federal officials and lawmakers, body cameras may do more to serve police interests than those of the public they are sworn to protect. To Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who is now a professor at the Joseph F. Rice School of Law at the University of South Carolina, body cameras represent the latest chapter in America’s quest for a technological fix to the deeply rooted problem of unchecked state power. “Dash cams were supposed to solve racial profiling,” he says. “Tasers and pepper spray were supposed to solve undue force. We have this real, almost pathological draw to ‘silver bullet’ syndrome. And I say that as a supporter of body-worn cameras.” He later added: “We just said to police departments: ‘Here’s this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.’ It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re going to use it in a way that most benefits them.” Jeff Schlanger, a former New York deputy commissioner who had an oversight role during the implementation of body-worn cameras and left the department in 2021, believes that the police have often failed to use the cameras for accountability and that political leaders need to do more. “Mayors, City Council members, all locally elected officials,” he says, “should be losing sleep over the lack of meaningful independent oversight of the police.” The shooting of Miguel Richards was the first to be recorded by N.Y.P.D. body cameras. Police Commissioner James O’Neill wrote in an internal message that releasing footage would show officers’ “restraint in the use of force.” Below are clips from the videos the police initially released. They contain graphic content. Officers answered a call for a wellness check and found Richards standing still in the far corner of his bedroom, holding a small folding knife. “Look, we could shut the door,” Officer Redmond Murphy said at one point. Instead, they shouted at him for the next 15 minutes. Officer Murphy says he thinks he sees something in Richards’s hand: “I don't know if it's a toy or a gun.” Officer Mark Fleming says, “I don't want to shoot you if you’ve got a fake gun in your hand. You hear me? But I will shoot you if that's a real gun.” A radio command from headquarters reminded the officers of N.Y.P.D. guidelines to “isolate and contain” a person in a mental-health crisis and to “use nonlethal force whenever possible” as they faced Richards. Fifteen minutes after arriving, they opened fire. An internal investigation later found that Richards “was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.” When full footage has been released, often by prosecutors or after public pressure, it often contradicts initial police accounts. In 2015, a white officer in Cincinnati killed a Black man during a traffic stop. The officer said his life was in danger. But his body-camera video showed that was a lie, and he was prosecuted for murder (charges were dropped after two mistrials). And in Philadelphia this August, an officer shot and killed a man after, the police said, he lunged at officers with “a weapon.” In fact, footage released by the district attorney — who charged the officer with murder — shows that the man was sitting in his own car. In New York, Miguel Richards’s parents weren’t the only ones who had doubts about the department’s claims that the shooting was unavoidable. The footage the department released stopped right when the officers fired at Richards. It didn’t include the minutes after the shooting, and it didn’t include footage from other police units that responded. Ruth Lowenkron, a disability rights lawyer who specializes in mental-health issues, wanted to see it all. Working for New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a legal-advocacy nonprofit, she and her colleagues, along with activists, had begun pushing the city to find an alternative to using the police as first responders to people in crisis. On her second day on the job, a sergeant shot and killed a 66-year-old woman who had schizophrenia and was holding a baseball bat in her Bronx apartment. The department’s own investigators concluded that the sergeant escalated the situation and caused the shooting. Now, watching the video the department released of Richards’s shooting, Lowenkron feared that the same thing happened to him. The department’s edited footage showed the officers making a few attempts to connect with Richards early in the encounter. “What’s your name, man?” one officer asked. But they were also barking increasingly terse commands. “You are seconds away from getting shot,” one officer said. “Do you want to die?” A few minutes later, as one of them warned that Richards might have a gun, the officers fired. Lowenkron filed a records request, certain that there was more to the story. In releasing the partial footage, the police commissioner had vowed that the “N.Y.P.D. is committed to being as transparent as possible.” But nearly three weeks after her request, Lowenkron received a different message from one of the department’s records officers: “I must deny access to these records.” Body-worn cameras were adopted by police departments across the country in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests in 2014, sparked when Michael Brown was killed by the police in Ferguson, Mo. The officer who shot Brown was not equipped with a camera, and there was a dispute about what happened in the last moments of Brown’s life. Amid deep schisms over race, justice and policing, there was at least agreement that police interactions should be recorded. Brown’s mother pressed for the technology to become standard equipment. “Please,” she begged Missouri legislators, “let police-worn body cameras be a voice of truth and transparency.” President Barack Obama put the cameras at the center of his plans to restore trust in policing. Cities quickly began spending millions on the devices, expenditures that continue today for storage and software. Los Angeles has spent nearly $60 million since getting cameras in 2016. In Philadelphia, where footage is rarely released, the cameras have cost taxpayers about $20 million. New York City has spent more than $50 million. But whether citizens benefit from the cameras they’re paying for is often up to the police, who have often been able to keep footage hidden from the public in even the most extreme cases. In 2018 in Montgomery, Ala., an officer unleashed his police dog on a burglary suspect without warning, severing the Black man’s femoral artery and killing him. The police and the city have refused to release footage for five years, arguing that it could cause “civil unrest” and that the officers could face “embarrassment.” But a lawyer for the man’s family, which is suing the city, got a copy of the transcript in the discovery process and entered it into the court record. “Did you get a bite?” an officer asked the one who had the dog, according to the document. “Sure did, heh, heh,” the K-9 officer responded. The secrecy undercuts the deterrent effect on officer behavior that many had presumed body cameras would produce. Three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck, body-camera video caught him kneeling on the necks of others. In 2017, Chauvin dragged a handcuffed Black woman out of her house, slammed her to the ground and then pressed his knee into her neck for nearly five minutes. Three months later, Chauvin hit a 14-year-old Black boy at least twice in the head with a heavy flashlight, choked him and pushed him against a wall. The boy cried out in pain and passed out. Chauvin pushed a knee into his neck for 15 minutes as the boy’s mother, reaching to help him, begged, “Please, please do not kill my son!” The footage was left in the control of a department where impunity reigned. Supervisors had access to the recordings yet cleared Chauvin’s conduct in both cases. Minneapolis fought against releasing the videos, even after Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal civil rights violations in one of the cases. A judge finally ordered the city and the police to release the tapes this April, six years after Chauvin abused the boy. “Chauvin should have been fired in 2017,” says Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented both of the victims. If the police had done that, “the city never burns. We’d have a downtown still. It’s a parade of horribles. All to keep something secret.” A Department of Justice report from this summer found that the secrecy and impunity was all part of a larger pattern in the Minneapolis Police Department. Shootings, beatings and other abuse had routinely been captured on video. But the department didn’t make the footage public or mete out punishment. There was a similar dynamic in Memphis, where officers in a street-crimes unit regularly abused residents. They wore body cameras but faced no consequences until the case of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death this January by officers in the unit, attracted national attention. The footage showed that some of the officers took their cameras off. Others knew they were being recorded and pummeled Nichols anyway. It was only after public outcry that the department took the rare step of releasing footage, which contradicted initial police accounts and led to state and federal charges for five officers. Some politicians have often quietly enabled obstacles to this kind of accountability. When South Carolina became the first state in the nation to require the use of cameras in 2015, Nikki Haley, the governor at the time, made the announcement with the family of Walter Scott standing behind her. Scott was a Black man who, two months earlier, was stopped by the police for a broken taillight and was shot in the back and killed when he tried to run away. A witness filmed the shooting, and that video contradicted official police accounts. “This is going to make sure Walter Scott did not die without us realizing that we have a problem,” Haley said as she signed the legislation. What the governor didn’t say was that the same law stipulated that footage from cameras is “not a public record subject to disclosure,” thus relieving police departments from any obligation to release it. And indeed, little footage has ever become public in South Carolina. In 2021, York County sheriff’s deputies responding to a call for a wellness check found a young man sitting in his pickup truck with his mother standing next to him. They fired at him nearly 50 times. The sheriff, who refused to release body-camera footage, said the man pointed a shotgun at deputies. When the man, who survived, obtained the footage after suing, it showed no such thing. So far this year, the police in South Carolina have killed at least 19 people. The police have released footage in only three of those cases. When we asked one department, the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office, why it had not, a spokesperson pointed to the law, writing, “We never release that footage.” The pattern has become so common across the country — public talk of transparency followed by a deliberate undermining of the stated goal — that the policing-oversight expert Hans Menos, who led Philadelphia’s civilian police-oversight board until 2020, coined a term for it: the “body-cam head fake.” And there is no place that illustrates this as well as New York City, the home of the world’s largest municipal police force, some 36,000 officers strong. New York’s adoption of body-worn cameras started with a moment of unintentional inspiration. In 2013, Judge Shira Scheindlin was hearing testimony in a federal lawsuit in which multiple advocacy groups claimed that the Police Department’s aggressive “stop and frisk” policy was racially biased and unconstitutional. One day during the trial, an expert witness for the city mentioned a new tool for accountability — body-worn cameras — in passing. “My head snapped when I heard the words,” Scheindlin recalled this year. “I thought, That could be a useful remedy!” Two months later, Scheindlin issued a historic ruling that New York’s stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional. She ordered the Police Department to begin piloting body-worn cameras, writing that they were “uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional harms at issue in this case.” Scheindlin laid out three different ways the cameras would help: “First, they will provide a contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks.” She continued: “Second, the knowledge that an exchange is being recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties. Third, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is their word against the police.” But in a preview of obstacles that would follow, the department was slow to roll out the devices, even as they were becoming common in other cities. More than two years after Scheindlin’s ruling, the department hired researchers at New York University to conduct a survey about what residents wanted from a body-camera project. The community’s answers were overwhelming and clear: transparency and disclosure. Officers, however, wanted the opposite. They were concerned that the recordings would “show a different side of the story than what would otherwise be told,” according to a separate N.Y.U. survey. To Scheindlin and the plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk case, that was exactly the point. When the department released its policy in April 2017, it was clear whose opinions held more sway. No video would automatically become public. Anyone that requested it would have to go through an opaque, often slow-moving Freedom of Information process — in which the department itself would be the arbiter of what would be released (though the courts could review that decision). ‘The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early—warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes.’ The policy blunted the technology’s potential for accountability in other ways. Officers could decide when to start filming, instead of at the beginning of all interactions as the public wanted. And while the public had little access to footage, the police had privileged access: Officers who were the subjects of complaints would be allowed to watch the footage before having to give any statements — something that could allow them to tailor their accounts to the video. The policy was “so flawed that the pilot program may do little to protect New Yorkers’ civil rights,” Ian Head and Darius Charney of the Center for Constitutional Rights wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times. “Instead, it might shield police officers from accountability when they engage in misconduct.” Still, on April 27, 2017, Commissioner James O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio held a news conference at a precinct in Washington Heights to celebrate the rollout of body-worn cameras. Stepping up to the lectern, O’Neill said he was initially skeptical of the cameras but had become a believer. “I’m totally convinced now that this is the way forward,” he said. “These cameras have a great potential to de-escalate.” Then the mayor went to the lectern. Officers had long felt that de Blasio, a self-proclaimed progressive, was too supportive of Black Lives Matter protests and not sufficiently supportive of the police. That sentiment turned into rage when a man espousing hatred of the police murdered two officers in late 2014. Hundreds of police officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funerals. Ever since, de Blasio had been working to repair the relationship. “This is an historic day for New York City,” de Blasio said, with O’Neill by his side. “This is the first day of the era of body-worn cameras, and that means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability that will benefit everyone.” Five months later, officers killed Miguel Richards, making his case the first in which the potential of body-camera video would be tested. But Ruth Lowenkron, the public-interest attorney who filed a request for the footage, was getting little from the Police Department. After it rejected her initial request, she appealed the decision. The department sent her some redacted footage but again rejected her request for all of it. Disclosing the full footage would be an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” the department wrote. Whose privacy — the dead man’s or the officers’ — was not explained. Releasing the full footage, the department insisted, could “endanger the life or safety of any person.” The letter came from the department’s legal unit, led by its deputy commissioner, Larry Byrne, who was known for his fierce advocacy for the department. From the outset of the body-worn-camera program, Byrne made it clear that he was resistant to widespread release of footage. “They are not public records in the sense that, because the officer turns the camera on, they are now in the public domain,” Byrne told NY1 in 2015. In fact, he insisted, “most of this footage” would never be made public. Lowenkron kept requesting the Richards footage and kept getting rejected or sent redacted video. In July 2018, she and her colleagues decided to file a lawsuit in state court demanding the full footage. They even got a former Police Department lawyer, Stuart Parker, to help litigate the suit pro bono. The department’s various explanations for its denials “pissed me off,” Parker recalls. He retired from the department as an assistant commissioner in 2016, the year before cameras were widely rolled out. But he had been excited by their potential and was frustrated by the department’s kneejerk secrecy. “There’s a good side to the department,” he says, “but there’s always been a self-serving dark side to it too.” In response to the suit, the department argued in legal filings that it had blurred the footage “in order to protect the privacy of both Richards and his family.” But Lowenkron and her team had obtained affidavits from Richards’s parents saying that the department never asked them whether they wanted the footage released or redacted. And what the Richardses wanted, they said, was for the full footage to be released to the public. Public disclosure of footage isn’t the only path to hold officers in New York accountable for misconduct. For 70 years, the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board had been vested with the responsibility to investigate New Yorkers’ allegations against the police. From the start, though, its powers were weak. The agency was actually part of the Police Department, and its board consisted of three deputy police commissioners. The department fought efforts over the years to make the agency independent. In the face of a plan in the mid-1960s to include civilians on the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the head of the largest police union, then called the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said, “I’m sick and tired of giving in to minority groups with their whims and their gripes and shouting.” The agency eventually became independent in 1993 after stiff opposition months before from off-duty officers. Thousands of them — along with Rudy Giuliani, then a mayoral aspirant after losing the previous election — staged a huge protest outside City Hall, with many of them going on to block the Brooklyn Bridge. After the changes, the review board still relied on an often noncooperative Police Department for records, and its investigations frequently petered out amid competing accounts. And like many civilian oversight boards across the country, in the rare cases where it substantiated misconduct, it could only recommend discipline to the police commissioner, who could and often did ignore it. Many civilians, whom the board relied on to initiate complaints, had long grown skeptical of the agency’s ability to ensure that officer misconduct had consequences. But the advent of body-camera video promised to fundamentally change how the agency worked. For the first time, staff members would have an objective record of the incidents they investigated. That was Nicole Napolitano’s hope when she joined the review board as its new director of policy and advocacy in September 2017 — the same year body cameras were rolled out in New York and one week after officers killed Richards. “We talked about it in detail” at the agency, she says of the initial footage of the Richards shooting. “We thought, Look at what body-worn cameras can show us.” Napolitano, who is married to a retired detective, knew it would be a challenge. As a senior policy manager in the Office of the Inspector General for the New York Police Department, she had seen how the department could simply ignore the recommendations in her reports. Napolitano hoped she would have more direct impact in her new, more senior position at the review board. But what she hadn’t appreciated was how much the police controlled the literal tools of their own oversight. As with most civilian boards across the country, the agency did not have its own access to footage. Like the public, it, too, had to rely on the cooperation of the department. To try to obtain footage, the board had to navigate a baroque multistep process. Written requests were submitted to a department “liaison” unit, which in turn forwarded them to the legal unit for review. Then the department had to locate the footage, which was a significant undertaking because it wasn’t cataloging the footage in any systematic way. Unlike in many other cities, the department’s cameras had no GPS location data. If a civilian making a complaint didn’t know an officer’s name or badge number, investigators and even the department could have a hard time finding footage. Perhaps most problematic for Napolitano, though, was the fact that the review board’s investigators had to agree to a strict set of conditions before watching videos of incidents. If they spotted other, unrelated misconduct, they were not allowed to investigate it. “If you were setting up a system to be shitty,” one agency insider says, “this is the system you’d create.” At times, the department’s animosity toward the board was palpable. Napolitano remembers one meeting in 2017 between board officials and Kerry Sweet, then a top official at the department’s legal bureau who helped oversee the body-camera rollout. As other police brass shuffled in, Sweet said they had missed a chance to “bomb the room” when only board officials were there, which would have “solved everything.” (Sweet, who has since retired, says he doesn’t recall saying that, but added, “On reflection, it should have been an airstrike.”) Napolitano and her colleagues noticed an even more troubling trend: The department would often tell the review board that the footage it requested didn’t exist — only for the civilian agency to later discover that wasn’t true. According to an analysis the agency put out in early 2020, this happened in nearly one of every five cases. Napolitano thought there was a straightforward solution to the department’s stonewalling: The review board should be able to directly log in to the department’s system where footage is stored. That’s how it worked with civilian oversight boards in a few other major American cities, including Chicago, which revamped civilian oversight after Laquan McDonald was killed in 2014 and the city tried to withhold footage that contradicted officers’ accounts. Chicago’s oversight board now not only has direct access to videos but also regularly releases footage publicly, and its investigators have used it to successfully push for officers to be fired for misconduct. Napolitano didn’t see a reason for it to be otherwise in New York. So in her first semiannual report, at the end of 2017, she noted the challenges of getting footage — and called on the city to give the review board direct access. Both the department and City Hall, Napolitano says, “freaked” out. “It was a rough time for de Blasio when it came to public safety,” Napolitano added, referring to the mayor’s tenuous relationship with the police. “In a dispute between C.C.R.B. and N.Y.P.D., City Hall always chose the N.Y.P.D. Always.” “I don’t agree,” de Blasio says. “The tension between the C.C.R.B. and the N.Y.P.D. is natural and built-in. I decided each issue on the merits and according to my values.” He went on: “The blunter truth is when a progressive challenges the police culture and the police unions and the status quo of American policing, the left is not going to have their back. You’re not getting that thank-you card. And the right will viciously attack.” While the department fought Lowenkron and Napolitano on the release of body-camera footage, there was one group that had access to all of it and could use it to check for misconduct: the department’s own investigators. After every police shooting, detectives with the Force Investigation Division review the incident to see whether officers complied with department policy. The Richards case was the first time body-worn-camera footage could let them see what actually happened in a killing by officers. As investigators dug through the video and interviewed officers in the weeks and months after the shooting, they saw a far more complicated picture than the one the police commissioner painted. As the tape began, one officer, Mark Fleming, beamed his flashlight into the far side of Richards’s nearly bare, unlit bedroom. Richards was standing perfectly still in the dark, seemingly catatonic, wearing a blue polo shirt and sunglasses and holding a knife in his left hand. Department guidelines for dealing with people in crisis who do not pose an immediate threat say officers should try to “isolate and contain” the person. “The primary duty of all members of the service is to preserve human life,” department policy states. Officers are also instructed to wait for a supervisor’s permission before trying to subdue someone in crisis. At first, it appeared that the officers who encountered Richards were following their training. “Look, we could shut the door,” Officer Redmond Murphy suggested to his partner. But Fleming, who had served more years in the department, quickly rejected the idea. He kept telling Richards to drop the knife, and he radioed for an officer with a Taser. Two officers from the specially trained Emergency Services Unit, which deals with people experiencing mental-health crises, arrived. Then Murphy said he thought he saw something, perhaps a gun, in Richards’s right hand, which was obscured behind a backpack on the bed. “Hold up,” one of the E.S.U. officers told Fleming and Murphy before heading back downstairs to grab protective gear. “I don’t know if it’s a toy or a gun,” Murphy quickly added. As the specialists went downstairs, the officer with the Taser, Jesus Ramos, went upstairs and joined Fleming and Murphy outside Richards’s room. “Do you want to take him down now?” Ramos asked them. “Yeah,” they both answered. At nearly the same moment, a radio command came from headquarters, emphasizing department guidelines. “Isolate and contain,” the dispatcher told the officers. “Use nonlethal force whenever possible.” As Ramos lifted his Taser and stepped into the room, Fleming — who later said Richards was raising his arm — fired his gun. Murphy fired, too. It’s impossible to see that moment in the grainy, shaky footage. The clearest angle would most likely have been Fleming’s camera, but it was covered by his arm as he held his flashlight. Fleming and Murphy fired 16 times, hitting Richards seven times, including twice in the chest, rupturing his aorta. As gunshots rang out, the supervisor they were supposed to wait for arrived. (None of the officers responded to requests for comment.) The internal investigators asked the officers to explain. “We kind of handle everything on our own,” Murphy offered. An internal investigator pressed Fleming about what had “situationally changed” and prompted the decision to “take him at that point.” Fleming said everything changed once his partner said Richards might have a gun. “I perceived that his intentions were lethal,” Fleming said. But his answers suggested that he hadn’t fully grasped Richards’s mental state. “Why would any sane person hide a fake gun?” Fleming asked. When the investigators asked why the two officers did not broadcast that Richards was an “E.D.P.” — or an emotionally disturbed person — with a knife, as protocol dictates, Murphy told them he and Fleming had handled people in crisis before. Asked why they made the decision to use force, Murphy simply said, “We wanted to, like, end it.” While the Force Investigation Division ultimately concluded that the officers had been “justified” in shooting — because they were facing an “individual armed with a knife and an imitation firearm” — the investigators also said that Fleming and Murphy should still be punished. Richards, their September 2018 internal report noted, “was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.” And the officers violated policy by not asking permission from their supervisor before they acted. The department’s full investigative record was first reported by the independent journalist Michael Hayes in his 2023 book, “The Secret Files.” The review recommended that the officers face disciplinary charges that could ultimately result in their firing. But in New York, as in almost all cities in the United States, the police commissioner has absolute power over punishment. In March 2019, O’Neill, who had extolled the promise of body cameras just two years earlier, overruled his own investigators. He decided that neither Fleming nor Murphy would be punished for killing Richards. Instead, the commissioner docked them three vacation days for something else they did: stopping for pizza before responding to the call for the wellness check. (O’Neill did not respond to questions or requests for comment.) It would be another three months before anyone outside the department would see the full footage. That June, a New York judge ruled that the “public is vested with an inherent right to know” and ordered the department to turn over the recordings to Lowenkron’s organization. She received a package with a DVD a month later from the department. Bracing herself, she sat down to view it on her computer. The footage that the department publicly released cut off when the officers fired. Lowenkron now saw the aftermath: Richards collapsed to the floor, crumpled and bleeding in the same spot where he had been standing rigidly seconds before. “He’s still alive,” Fleming said. “Holy shit,” Murphy replied. “Just fucking cuff him.” The officers then flipped over Richards, severely injured, so roughly that his head could be heard bouncing off the floor. They searched around the room for the firearm they thought Richards had. Eventually, Fleming found a palm-size, silver-colored plastic toy gun. “It’s some fucking little thing,” he said. (The video does not show Richards holding the toy gun.) More than three minutes passed before anyone administered any type of aid to the dying man. It was an Emergency Services Unit specialist who retrieved medical equipment after hearing the shots. Outside the apartment building, more video recorded other officers milling about. One told a colleague, “They were just hurling fucking shots.” The N.Y.P.D. initially withheld the footage of the aftermath of the Miguel Richards shooting. Below are clips from the videos that a state judge later ordered released. They contain graphic content. As the officers move into Miguel Richards’s room moments after shooting him, Fleming observes, “He’s still alive.” Officer Murphy is breathing heavily. “Holy shit,” he says. The officers ask one another if they are all right as they mill around Richards’s injured body. He is handcuffed and flipped over so roughly his head can be heard bouncing heavily on the floor. As more officers arrive outside Richards’s apartment building, one tells a colleague, “They were just hurling fucking shots.” Lowenkron was shocked. Officers had shot a young man and roughly handled him as he bled to death. “The utter disrespect,” Lowenkron says. “It was a horror movie.” New York Lawyers for the Public Interest would go on to share the footage with journalists. It would also use the footage in a webinar for mental-health advocates in November 2020. “The point,” Lowenkron told me, “was to get more people engaged on this issue: transforming New York and this country’s response to people in crisis.” But by then, for another man in distress, it was too late. In April 2019, one month after O’Neill decided against punishing the officers for the Richards shooting, another officer shot and killed a man named Kawaski Trawick. The circumstances were remarkably similar to those in the Richards case. Trawick was also a young Black man who lived in the Bronx and was experiencing a mental-health crisis in his own apartment. He was also holding a knife when the police arrived. And he was also shot soon afterward. At the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Napolitano was immediately struck by the parallels: “I remember reading the headline on Trawick and thinking, Didn’t I read this already?” This time, though, the victim’s family filed a complaint with the review board, providing an opening for civilian investigators to use body-worn-camera footage to make a case that the department and others couldn’t ignore. But despite repeated requests over many months, the department wouldn’t share the footage — or any other records — with the review board, leaving the oversight agency effectively unable to begin its own investigation of the case. The refusal was in line with the department’s longstanding practice to withhold footage from the board until the department’s internal investigation was over, a process that often takes more than a year. Such delays can effectively torpedo the review board’s investigations: Under New York civil-service law, any disciplinary cases against police officers must be brought within 18 months of the incident. In the Trawick case, the review board obtained the full body-camera video in January 2021 — more than a year and a half after the killing — and only after a state judge ordered the department to hand it over to Lowenkron’s organization, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, which had sued for it. The judge determined that the department had been withholding the footage “in bad faith.” What it showed was even more damning than what was captured in the Richards shooting. As the police entered his apartment, Trawick demanded to know, “Why are you in my home?” One officer, Herbert Davis, who was Black and more experienced, then tried to stop his white junior counterpart, Brendan Thompson, from using force. “We ain’t gonna tase him,” Davis said in the video. Thompson didn’t listen. Instead, he fired his Taser at Trawick, sending roughly 50,000 volts pulsing through him. As Trawick started rushing toward the officers, Thompson lifted his gun and prepared to fire. “No, no — don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t,” Davis said, pushing his partner’s arm down. But Thompson fired four shots, hitting Trawick twice and killing him almost instantly, 112 seconds after they arrived at the apartment. (Davis and Thompson did not reply to requests for comment.) There was also troubling footage of the aftermath of the shooting. Officers swarmed outside Trawick’s apartment. “Who’s injured?” a sergeant asked. Two officers replied in near unison: “Nobody. Just a perp.” With all that in hand, the review board completed its investigation in June 2021. The agency, through one of the few powers it had gained over the years, can file and prosecute disciplinary cases against officers — which triggers a Police Department trial, after which a departmental judge sends a provisional decision to the police commissioner, who makes the final call. This September, the police judge overseeing the Trawick case recommended that there should be no discipline. Her reason had nothing to do with the shooting itself; in fact, the judge wrote that she had “serious doubts” about the decisions of the officer who killed Trawick. But the review board, she said, had failed to file charges within the 18-month statute of limitations, as outlined under state law. In the end, the department’s refusal to give the footage to the review board had effectively run out the clock on any chance the officers would be punished. “That should not be tolerated,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “Both C.C.R.B. and N.Y.P.D. are city agencies. This is something the mayor needs to resolve.” In the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, huge demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality rolled across the country and the world. It was a global reckoning brought on by footage — the video, recorded by a teenager on her smartphone for more than eight minutes, showing Derek Chauvin ending Floyd’s life. Napolitano and her team at the review board had collected data showing how footage could make a difference in New York too. Access to body-camera footage roughly doubled the likelihood that agency investigators would be able to decide a case on its merits rather than dismiss it as inconclusive. But the backlog was growing. That May, the board filed 212 requests with the Police Department for body-worn-camera footage — and the department sent only 33 responses. (While the pandemic slowed the work of all city agencies, the backlog predated it.) “The withholding of footage stops investigations and prevents the C.C.R.B. from providing adequate and meaningful oversight of the N.Y.P.D.,” an internal agency memo warned. “The situation for New York City oversight of the police has steadily grown worse during the duration of a B.W.C. program intended primarily to aid oversight.” ‘We just said to police departments: “Here’s this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.” It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re going to use it in a way that most benefits them.’ Napolitano campaigned internally for a law that would take away the department’s absolute control over footage and give the review board its own access. That November, she was let go, along with three other staff members who had sent pointed emails and memos about the department’s withholding of footage. The four filed a lawsuit claiming that their firing violated their First Amendment rights and received an undisclosed settlement. A review-board spokeswoman wrote in an email that the agency has “publicly and repeatedly called on legislators to support the fight for direct access. No employee has ever been fired for supporting direct access to B.W.C. footage.” This spring, the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, and the New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams, sponsored a bill that would give the review board direct access to footage so that it wouldn’t be beholden to the department for cooperation during investigations. “There are difficult split-second decisions that have to happen” in policing, Williams told me. “But if we’re not able to look at the same thing, if we have to take the word of the N.Y.P.D., that doesn’t make this conversation any easier.” The Police Department has opposed the bill. A department official insisted at a City Council hearing in March that the department “does not fear transparency.” But the official argued that it would be an “insurmountable obstacle” to give the review board direct access while following state confidentiality laws. The bill has been stalled for months. The city, meanwhile, paid out at least $121 million in settlements last year for lawsuits alleging misconduct by police officers — the highest total in five years. With footage remaining in the control of the Police Department, body-worn cameras have made little difference to the public. This year, a federal court monitor wrote a scathing report about persistent problems with stop-and-frisk, the unconstitutional policing tactic that prompted Judge Scheindlin to order the department to adopt body cameras a decade ago. The monitor found that contrary to Scheindlin’s expectations, police supervisors weren’t using footage to flag misconduct. In a sample of cases the monitor looked at, supervisors reviewing footage of stop-and-frisk encounters concluded that 100 percent of the cases they looked at were proper stops. The court monitor reviewed the same footage and found that 37 percent of the stops were unconstitutional. “It was an experiment,” Scheindlin says, one that didn’t anticipate issues like control over footage. Scheindlin, who stepped down from the bench in 2016, says she now believes that the Police Department should no longer be the sole custodian of its own video. “That troubles me,” she says. “It should always be somebody independent.” In interviews with a half dozen former commanders and high-level officials, most of whom were involved in the body-camera program itself, they said that despite its public pronouncements, the department hasn’t committed to using footage for accountability. “Body cams are essential, if done right,” says a high-ranking commander who just retired and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in law enforcement. “They are a game changer.” He added: “If there’s a problem, you flag — and potentially there’s discipline. But that’s not happening in most cases.” Instead, he says, body cameras have become “an exercise in just work they have to do. It’s a culture thing.” Rudy Hall has a particularly useful vantage point. He was part of the team that rolled out the body cameras, visiting police departments around the country to see how they were using the technology, and has gone on to work for the federal monitor overseeing the department’s compliance with Scheindlin’s now-decade-old order on stop-and-frisk. “I watch a lot of body-cam videos,” Hall told me. “I have absolutely seen supervisors approve problematic conduct.” “Body-worn cameras have not been exploited the way they should be,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early-warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes. But there weren’t a lot of discussions about it. The N.Y.P.D. needs to do a lot better.” One of the most comprehensive studies of the use of body cameras, a 2019 meta-analysis led by researchers at George Mason University, recommended that police departments consider using footage the way sports teams use game tape, to regularly review and improve performance. That’s essentially what the New Orleans Police Department did after the U.S. Department of Justice put it under federal oversight about a decade ago in response to the police killings of several Black men and persistent police violence. Body cameras were a “critical engine for us to continuously evaluate performance,” says Danny Murphy, who ran a unit at the department overseeing compliance with the federal mandate. Four auditors were hired to join the police force and comb through footage. They looked to make sure that officers were using their cameras and that supervisors were flagging any problematic behavior. “If officers know they’re being viewed, if supervisors know they’re being reviewed, it creates a pressure for accountability,” says Murphy, who left the department four years ago. A 2020 report from the city’s civilian oversight agency — which has direct access to footage — noted a reduction in both the use of force and citizen complaints, which the department attributed to “the use of the body-worn cameras and the increased scrutiny and oversight these cameras provide leadership.” The police in New Orleans also regularly and quickly release video from shootings and other major incidents. But in the end, it’s the police chief who has the final say on discipline. During his tenure at the New York Police Department, Schlanger had, in fact, started a kind of internal oversight system similar to the one in New Orleans. Schlanger and other senior officials would meet with each of the department’s 77 precincts every six months and look at body-camera footage to identify problematic trends and officers. “It was CompStat for constitutional policing,” Schlanger says, referring to the department’s data-heavy program for tracking crime. “If we saw a precinct doing poorly, we’d work to help them. It made a difference.” The department quietly ended the review program last year. A civil suit on behalf of Miguel Richards’s estate was filed against the city in 2018. New York is seeking the dismissal of the case. A judge has been considering the request for two and a half years. “I want answers,” his mother told me, “and haven’t been able to get them.” The three officers involved in the Richards shooting were honored in 2018 by the largest New York police union, the Police Benevolent Association, which gave them its Finest of the Finest award for “extremely brave and tactically sound action” in the Richards shooting, noting that “the officers had no choice but to open fire.” The officers were later deposed in the lawsuit. One of them, Mark Fleming, said in his testimony in September 2020 that he had learned a lesson: that the Emergency Services Unit — whose help he told department investigators he didn’t need — is in fact better equipped and trained to deal with situations that involve people having a mental-health crisis. It’s not clear what, if any, lessons the department itself has taken in. Since Richards’s death in 2017, when cameras were widely rolled out, officers have killed at least 11 people in crisis. There is no evidence that officers have been punished in any of the cases. On a Sunday morning in the Bronx this spring, there was another shooting. Santo de la Cruz called a city emergency line. His son, 42-year-old Raul de la Cruz, was in the middle of a schizophrenic episode and had posted a disturbing video on Facebook that morning. Wearing camouflage clothing and a hat with a patch of an Israeli flag, Raul complained about racist police officers. His father called 311, avoiding 911 because he was afraid of what would happen if the police showed up. “I thought they would send someone capable of dealing with a situation like that,” he says in Spanish. “Because I was calling for a sick person, not to send the police to shoot him up.” But it was the police who arrived, with body cameras rolling. And Raul was holding a knife. The officers shot him 28 seconds after arriving. He was hospitalized for more than a month before being released, having lost a kidney and part of his liver. A department commander cited the body-camera footage when he gave a brief news conference the day of the shooting to describe what happened. “This situation was fast, volatile and dangerous,” he said. The officers’ “quick response saved at least one civilian and protected themselves.” But the department has not released the footage or commented in the eight months since. Lowenkron’s colleagues at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest have once again requested the video, so far to no avail. The department has also withheld the footage from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, per the practice of sharing records with the agency only after its own investigation is done. On Dec. 5, weeks after we sent questions to the department about that practice, the department signed a memorandum of understanding with the board to send footage to it within 90 days of a request. But for now, nobody outside the department knows exactly what happened in the de la Cruz shooting, including the family. They have not heard anything from the department. They want to see the footage. This article is a partnership between ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine. Additional reporting by Umar Farooq.

The NBA played games in the bubble and the Blake shooting coupled with the death of George Floyd was on playersâ minds during that summer. The Lakers star at the time said he hoped they made Colin Kaepernick “proud.” “Kap was someone who stood up when times werenât comfortable. When people didnât understand, when people refused to listen to what he was saying,” he said at the time. “You go back and look at any of his postgame interviews when he was talking about why he was kneeling â it had absolutely nothing to do about the flag, he had absolutely nothing to do about soldiers.” By all accounts, James hasnât knelt during the national anthem since 2020.

According to court documents, 24-year-old Patricia Johnson was charged with one count of criminal recklessness, a Level 6 felony, as well as two misdemeanors related to operating a vehicle while intoxicated. According to previous reports, an IMPD officer shot his weapon near the intersection of 30th and Tibbs Ave. early Sunday morning. This comes after a chase ensued after an illegal street racing event, which led to the arrest of 23-year-old Sebastian Jimenez. Around 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, officers were investigating the incident at 30th and Tibbs Ave. The documents said that officers had 30th Street shut down westbound from Kessler Blvd. N Drive. At the time, officers said that vehicles drove around his police vehicle that was blocking the road and driving toward the crime scene. One of the vehicles that went past the barricade included a silver Chevrolet driven by a woman later identified as Johnson. The documents said an officer exited his vehicle and told Johnson to reverse her vehicle. Johnson responded to the officer, telling him that something was wrong with her tire. As the officer continued to ask Johnson to turn around because of the crime scene, the documents said Johnson “acknowledged that she understood.” The officer began to walk around the front of Johnson’s vehicle to get out of the way when Johnson “rapidly accelerated while turning left, causing (the officer) to jump up over the front passenger end of her vehicle, nearly clipping (the officer’s) right leg to avoid being struck.” Officials said Johnson continued accelerating to do a U-turn when officers ordered her to stop and exit the vehicle. The documents said Johnson’s vehicle’s passenger rear tire was “completely shredded and torn apart. When Johnson was placed in handcuffs, officials said they could smell “a strong odor” of alcohol on her breath. Johnson was then taken to a local hospital to have her blood drawn. According to court documents, an initial hearing for Johnson is scheduled for Jan. 4, 2024."

(THE CONVERSATION) Violent crime, and how to reduce it, dominated the 2023 Philadelphia mayoral campaign. As a candidate, Cherelle Parker suggested she would support using stop-and-frisk to combat gun violence. After being elected, Parker reiterated her stance, but emphasized “there is no place for unconstitutional stop-and-frisk.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad The ACLU of Philadelphia objected to the incoming mayor’s position during the campaign. The civil liberties advocacy organization pointed to the lawsuit it brought against the Philadelphia Police Department in 2010, stop data that continued to show persistent racial disparities, and the lack of empirical support for the effectiveness of the strategy. As criminologists with expertise in policing and law, we previously explained that stop-and-frisk can be both constitutional and useful if carefully controlled. We agree with the Philadelphia Inquirer observation that this “requires a change in culture and accountability.” Below, we explain what stop-and-frisk is and how it has been used in Philadelphia. Then we describe those critically important controls. What is stop-and-frisk? Advertisement Article continues below this ad In the landmark 1968 ruling Terry v. Ohio, the U.S. Supreme Court authorized law enforcement to briefly detain and question criminal suspects based on reasonable, “articulable” suspicion. This standard of proof involves more than a hunch – but less than probable cause – that the person stopped is involved in criminal activity. If there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is armed, officers may conduct a limited pat-down to check for weapons. Over the next few decades, police departments across the United States morphed this tool into a broad, unconstitutional crime-control strategy that Howard University Law Professor Andrew E. Taslitz writes often relied on “stereotypes, assumptions, [and] guilt-by-association.” History of stop-and-frisk in Philadelphia In Philadelphia, stop-and-frisk gained a foothold in the 1990s. By 2007, it was broadly instituted as a formal policy. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Two years later, Philadelphia police stopped more than 253,000 people. African Americans accounted for more than 70% of these stops even though they comprised 43% of the city’s population at the time. Only 8.4% of stops resulted in arrests. These disparities led to the class-action lawsuit in 2010. Philadelphia settled the lawsuit in 2011 by entering into a consent decree, a type of legal agreement. The city promised to train its police officers on the legal parameters for valid stop-and-frisks, monitor how police conduct them, and discipline those who engaged in unconstitutional practices. Philadelphia curtailed its use of stop-and-frisk in 2015 but never entirely abandoned the tactic. Racial disparitiespersist. Nearly 40% of stops conducted in 2019 lacked reasonable suspicion, thereby violating the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizures. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Measuring effectiveness As the ACLU of Pennsylvania noted, at best “stop-and-frisk is a scary inconvenience.” The “average Philadelphia pedestrian stop lasts 13 minutes” – long enough to delay people for work, child care or other key responsibilities. Worse, encounters with the police have the potential to turn violent, with police disproportionatelyusing force again Black and Hispanic men. And as the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Tyre Nichols illustrate, stop-and-frisks against men of color can end with police using deadly force. Notably, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police, although police killings are the sixth-leading cause of death among men of all races aged 25 to 29. Despite these consequences, Philadelphia’s recent surge in violence prompted calls for re-implementation of a broad stop-and-frisk strategy. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Some people believe the strategy works because between 2007 and 2009, a period when Philadelphia aggressively employed stop-and-frisk, homicides decreased by roughly 22%. But crime data shows that when the city reduced its use of stop-and-frisk under the terms of the consent decree, violent crime did not significantly increase. As Philadelphia’s public radio station WHYY explained, the “major spike in gun violence didn’t begin until 2019, and it worsened during the sustained period of socioeconomic instability following the COVID-19 pandemic.” Indeed, firearm violence and homicidesrosenationwideduring the pandemic. Experts say this trend “is much more likely related to unemployment, racism, mental health, and other systemic causes than it is to policing practices.” Perhaps counterintuitively, aggressive policing strategies like stop-and-frisk have the potential to increase crime. That’s because they can create more distrust of law enforcement among people of colorwhom police target. In turn, people in communities of color may then be less likely to call police and cooperate with them. A road map to avoid past problems Advertisement Article continues below this ad So what would we tell Mayor-elect Parker and her choice for police commissioner, Kevin Bethel, if they asked us how to make it work? We would share these evidence-based suggestions that could minimize bias if stop-and-frisk were more widely implemented in Philadelphia. – Enhance and sustain efforts to recruit diverse officers. Like manypolicedepartments, Philadelphia’s faces staffingshortages. The city is using its recruitment efforts as an opportunity to attract a racially diverse applicant pool, a positive step. We’d also suggest evaluating police recruits’ racialattitudes and eliminate anyone from that pool who demonstrates racial biases. – Pair stop-and-frisk training with implicit bias training, which educates officers on the subtleties of how racial biases can affect their decision-making. Police departments can also provide procedural justice training, which promotes fair, respectful treatment of community members. – Train police on the constitutional requirements of the tactic. As the court-appointed monitor for the New York City Police Department, Peter Zimroth, observed, officers need to understand the legal framework for stop-and-frisks, and the types and levels of proof they need to satisfy before making them. Advertisement Article continues below this ad – Implement community engagement strategies to offset some of the harms that stop-and-frisk can cause. For example, Mayor Parker’s current safety plan includes hiring 300 foot and bike patrol officers who have the potential to engage the community in ways that buildsupport for policing operations. That’s smart, if they adhere to constitutional mandates and the tenets of community policing and procedural justice. – Require officers to complete a written report for each stop-and-frisk, and have supervisors review them regularly. – Require officers, with their body-worn camerasturned on, to articulate why they are stopping someone. Their reasons should also be conveyed to the person who is stopped. – Harness body cam footage to monitor stop-and-frisk. Researchers examining the NYPD’s program concluded that body cams increased compliance with stop-and-frisk reporting requirements. Supervisors should routinely review footage to assess the constitutionality of stops and the interactions that follow. Police departments might explore using artificial intelligence technology to examine the vast amounts of footage they capture. Advertisement Article continues below this ad By following these guidelines, we believe police in Philadelphia – and elsewhere – can use stop-and-frisk as a lawful mechanism to reduce crime and violence, while honoring residents’ constitutional rights. Without these essential controls, however, the failed history of stop-and-frisk is doomed to be repeated. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

At a press conference in front of the Pasadena Police Department Wednesday, Dec. 13, attorney Brad Gage announced Officer Jarvis Shelby has filed a claim against the city, alleging among other offenses that Pasadena Police Commander Bill Grisafe put him in a headlock, resulting in injuries. Gage also represents Officer Taisyn Crutchfield, who on Nov. 30 filed a claim alleging she was subject to the same offenses after she was placed on administrative leave following what Crutchfield said was an attempt to de-escalate a situation involving another officer and the son of a man fatally shot by deputies. A claim is the first step to a possible lawsuit against the city, which has 45 days to respond. According to Gage, his clients are seeking a combined total of $30 million for their claims. Requests for comment from the Pasadena Police Department and the officers accused of wrongdoing in the suits were referred to the city’s public information officer. “There are at least two sides to every story, and complainants are free to take their side to the media. The City of Pasadena cannot respond in a public debate regarding the claims, as they involve personnel matters, which are confidential under California law,” Pasadena Public Information Officer Lisa Derderian said. “With that said, personnel complaints against any Pasadena police officers are investigated thoroughly and fairly, and all personnel throughout our ranks are always held accountable for their actions when warranted.” Gage said that following his injuries, which were described as potentially career ending, Officer Shelby was no longer able to perform his job duties and is currently out of work because of this. While no description was given about what led up to the Aug. 23, 2023 incident, Gage added that there was no justification for the alleged actions and that no known disciplinary action was taken against Grisafe. Shelby, who has worked for the department since 2017, also claimed that before that incident he was denied a promotion to the role of corporal due to his race and that the department denied him the ability to file a grievance about it. In all, the claims allege retaliation, discrimination, and harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, whistleblower retaliation, violation of the Peace Officers Bill of Rights, failure to take corrective action, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, battery, and violations of the Bane Act and Brown Act. Crutchfield’s claim stems from what happened on Feb. 20 at Walnut Street and Marengo Avenue around 2 a.m. In her claim, Crutchfield said an officer was speaking with Barsha Knox and her son Carlos Towns — who is the son of Charles Towns, who had been fatally shot by Los Angeles Sheriff deputies in Altadena on Jan. 22 — when PPD Officer Ralph Palacios ran over from the nearby Police Department and aggressively took hold of Towns. An officer noticed what looked like an argument among three people, according to Pasadena Police Chief Eugene Harris. Police ended up detaining and putting handcuffs on Town, his minor brother, and Knox, though they were not arrested or cited. In the police body camera footage released by the city in June, Crutchfield can be seen pushing or touching Officer Palacios at one point. She said it was an attempt to guide him away from Knox, who tried to intervene after Palacios “face-planted” Towns into a nearby flower pot while attempting to put him in handcuffs. Palacios responded by pushing Crutchfield, using profanity and yelling at her not to touch him, the claim states, before she was told by a sergeant to return to the station where she was interviewed. Gage said Crutchfield, who was placed on administrative leave and has since returned to active duty, was not told of the findings of an investigation into the incident but was told that she will face discipline. Pasadena released a statement on Dec. 1 acknowledging Crutchfield’s claim. “The facts alleged about the incident are inaccurate, as is evident in the video,” it stated, in reference to body cam footage the city released in June. “The city will vigorously defend itself in this matter and the facts will prevail. The Pasadena Police Department proudly serves the residents of Pasadena with honor and integrity, and is proud of its diversity throughout all ranks of the Department.” At the press conference and in their claims, attorneys also detailed incidents that their clients and other Pasadena police officers faced that they allege shows a pattern of discrimination and harassment of the department’s Black officers. In one such incident highlighting the alleged work climate, Gage claimed that former Pasadena Police Officer Arthur Robinson was subject to racials slurs and accusations that he was a “token” hire. He also claimed that as a trainee, Robinson’s training officer offered $40 to an arrested suspect if he would fight Robinson. Robinson resigned from PPD due to the harassment and fear for his safety, according to Gage. “If Black police officers are threatened or physically assaulted, what does that mean for members of the community,” Gage said, adding that the discrimination risks the city’s public safety, not just the officers. Gage added Wednesday that Crutchfield has since been subject to additional retaliation, claiming she was called to respond to reports of a man with a gun but did not receive backup in the situation. He said the incident came just hours after announcing her suit at a Dec. 1 press conference. Staff Writer Ruby Gonzales contributed to this article."

Officers located the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, but the vehicle failed to yield. “The suspect vehicle drove on the wrong side of the road, ran red lights, an weaved in and out of traffic as he attempted to evade capture,” the report reads. Smith then allegedly hit an unrelated vehicle, according to Giri, injuring an innocent bystander. Smith then fled officers, who established a perimeter. After a standoff, Smith was arrested and identified, and the vehicle he was driving was indicated to be stolen. A handgun was recovered at the scene of the crime, according to a press release from Vallejo police. The Solano County Major Crimes Task Force responded and assumed control of the entire criminal investigation. The City of Vallejo has hired a third-party investigator to conduct the administrative investigation to determine if any officers violated department policies. Finally, the police department convened its Critical Incident Review Board which conducts a holistic evaluation of the incident from an agency improvement perspective. The officer involved in this shooting is Corporal Matthew Komoda, a 17-year police veteran. Corporal Komoda was assigned to the patrol division at the time of this critical incident. According to the Wednesday news release, immediately following the event, Corporal Komoda was placed on administrative leave pursuant to department policy. The news release states that, “Because this incident involved the arrest of a juvenile, state law prohibits the release of information related to the investigation. Additionally, the District Attorney’s Office filed a motion that was granted in Solano County Superior Court to preclude the Vallejo Police Department from releasing video evidence in this case. As such, the information and details provided to the public regarding this case will continue to be very limited. The department will not be able to provide video evidence, to include body-worn camera footage, of this incident to the public at this time. No body camera footage of the incident will be released to the public by Vallejo Police Department, after the prosecutor in this case moved to prevent it and Commissioner Bryan Kim agreed. With that said, VPD will still hold the town hall meeting “to provide maximum transparency and inform the public about the internal processes that are initiated following an officer-involved shooting,” according to the news release. These processes include: the responsibility of the Solano County Major Crimes Task Force, the role of the independent investigator conducting the administrative investigation, and our internal Critical Incident Review Board (CIRB).

The additional time was imposed on Damian Bradford, 42, after a judge determined that he violated his release from prison in that case when he shot a state trooper in Beaver County in July 2022, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. The 10-year federal prison term will run consecutively to the state prison sentence of 36½ to 73 years that was imposed in November for the trooper shooting, according to court records. The shooting in Aliquippa happened while Bradford was serving a five-year term of supervised release after spending 14 years in a federal prison. One of two troopers investigating a disturbance at a convenience store there was shot in the leg by Bradford, according to a criminal complaint.

Donna Moonda asked Bradford to kill her husband and promised Bradford half of everything she collected from her husband’s estate. They established a plan where the Moondas would take a road trip to Toledo, and she would pull over. On May 13, 2005, they executed their plan — Bradford shot Dr. Moonda once in the head.

(KAKE) - The Wichita Police Department and the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office have created a new collaborative initiative, the Advanced Law Enforcement Response Team or ALERT. “Alert is for our community and stakeholders who deserve nothing less than the finest level of investigative procedures and our adherence to a high level of above standard practices,” said Joe Sullivan, Chief of Wichita Police. “The intent of the ALERT team is to allow for independent investigators from a separate agency to conduct the bulk of the investigation and present those facts to the DA’s office- without the involved agency being a major player in that investigation,” said Aaron Moses, Wichita Police Department. Any “officer involved critical incidents,” like an officer involved shooting, will be investigated by ALERT, changing the current investigation trends. “This involves any officer involved incident so whether its a death in custody because they had a heart attack, ingested drugs and overdosed from those, it's not just the shooting aspect so that’s why this team was formed,” said Jeff Easter, Sedgwick County Sheriff. In years past, when there is an officer involved critical incident, law enforcement has reached out to KBI for oversight, but this has created challenges due to KBI’s limited agents according to Wichita Police. “We feel moving this direction allows us to have more investigators from outside agencies to carry the primary investigation,” said Moses. However this does not mean the KBI will never be involved in an officer involved incident. “There are still incidents where the KBI could be involved if there’s an incident that involves both the Wichita Police Department and the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office,” said Moses. ALERT will consist of approximately 20 detectives in total, about ten from each agency and they have all undergone training classes from the Association of Force Investigators to prepare for their new duties. KAKE reached out to the Racial Profiling Citizens Advisory Board who gave the statement below about this new law enforcement initiative. ""The Racial Profiling Citizens Advisory Board supports citizen engagement when law enforcement agencies require investigation. We also support law enforcement agencies allocating more resources to the investigation of officer involved incidents. This special unit should be required to include community members are invited to participate and assist. This special unit should also review and update the body worn camera policy to ensure the presence of exempt material on a video is not a reason to deny access, and that this special unit be added to the policy. Steps like these in tandem with joint investigation will help build bridges in the community towards Truth, Trust, Integrity, Transparency and Accountability."" Below is the full press release from WPD about ALERT. “WICHITA, KS. – This morning, Wichita Police Chief Joe Sullivan and Sedgwick County Sheriff Jeff Easter jointly announced the establishment of the Advanced Law Enforcement Response Team (ALERT). Comprised of seasoned investigators from both the Wichita Police Department and the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office, ALERT is directed by Chief Joe Sullivan and Sheriff Jeff Easter. Strategically formed, the purpose of ALERT is to address the critical need for a specialized unit to oversee investigations following incidents involving officers or deputies. The key objectives include: - Preserving Investigation Integrity: ALERT ensures a robust mechanism is in place to maintain the integrity of investigations into critical incidents. - Conflict of Interest Avoidance: The team is designed to prevent both real and perceived conflicts of interest, fostering an environment of trust and impartiality. - Transparency: Emphasizing the incorporation of best practices, ALERT aims to build trust within the community by ensuring transparent communication throughout the investigative process. Chief Sullivan said, ""We want to ensure those protocols are in place so that when an investigation of a critical incident occurs, we incorporate best practices that help build trust in our community."" This investigative process is critical when an incident occurs. It's to ensure the agency directly connected with the incident will not conduct the investigation. Instead, an investigator from an uninvolved agency will lead the inquiry. While the involved agency will play a vital role by providing necessary resources and staff, adherence to protocols ensuring a thorough and unbiased event examination remains paramount. This initiative reflects a commitment to accountability, transparency, and community trust. ALERT stands as a testament to the collaborative efforts of the Wichita Police Department and the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office in advancing law enforcement practices.”"

Police say, 40-year-old Dioul Devaughn, has been charged with 21 offenses, including Attempted Murder, Aggravated Assault, Assault on Law Enforcement Officers, Simple Assault, and other related charges as they relate to each officer. According to officials, the shooting occurred on Sunday, December 10, 2023, at 2:32 A.M., when a 2nd District sergeant responded to a radio call for a “black male wearing a tan puffy jacket in a Grey Ford Pick-up truck” firing a gun in the area of Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard. The officer located the occupied vehicle on the 7300 block of Brous Avenue, conducted a traffic stop at the intersection of Saint Vincent and Roosevelt Boulevard, and requested backup via police radio. However as the sergeant exited his marked police vehicle and approached the Dodge, Devaughn sped off. A short time later, Officers with the Highway Patrol Unit located the Dodge and attempted to do a traffic stop on 8000 Frankford Ave at Welsh Road. The officers parked their car in front of the Dodge, and Devaughn slammed into the back of the patrol car, causing major damage to the car. As the Officers exited the police car, Devaughn began firing at officers, striking one of the officers in the ankle, grazing the other in the head, and causing a graze wound on the bridge of his nose. Both Officers were able to fire back. As the shootout was going on, two additional officers arrived on the scene, parked behind the Dodge, and began firing at Devaughn, injuring him. The police car which was hit by Devaughn was struck with gunfire multiple times, causing the passenger window glass to shatter. Both injured officers were taken to Jefferson Torresdale Hospital in stable condition. They have both since been released with non-life-threatening injuries. Devaughn was transported to Jefferson Torresdale Hospital in critical condition. Police located Devaughn’s gun inside the Dodge Ram pick-up truck. The injured officers involved in this incident are a 32-year-old, 9-year veteran of the PPD, a 31-year-old, 6-year veteran of the PPD, a 34-year-old, 12-year veteran of the PPD, and a 40-year-old, 18-year veteran of the PPD. All officers are currently working as Highway Patrol Officers. All four officers have been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of the Officer-Involved Shooting investigation and Internal Affairs investigation."

The officers who fired the deadly bullets in December were also involved in a shooting earlier this year in February. The February shooting sent a man to the hospital, but he survived. Around 3 p.m. on Dec. 11, officers responded to a shots fired call at a Days Inn near the Arkansas State Police Headquarters. (The address is 8219 Interstate 30, near Geyer Springs Road.) Two Little Rock cops, Mark Ray and Dakota Faircloth, responded. Before their arrival, they were told multiple shots had been fired and the suspect also fired into the Days Inn. Officers located 38-year-old Michael Johnson at the hotel and instructed him to comply with their orders. When Johnson instead moved to grab something from his waistband, the officers fired their weapons. Johnson was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. An investigation into the officer-involved shooting is underway. Police Chief Heath Helton said Tuesday the footage was being examined to determine if the use of deadly force was appropriate. Ray, 54, and Faircloth, 26, are on administrative leave during the investigation. They have worked with the LRPD for four years. The two officers — as well as another officer, Lindsey Coffman — were involved in an officer-involved shooting in February. That shooting occurred on West 65th Street. Officers shot their guns after 49-year-old James Mosby fired several times toward the cops, according to a police report. Mosby was shot, but not fatally. He received medical attention and was then taken into police custody. We have asked the Little Rock Police Department how long Ray and Faircloth were on administrative leave after the February shooting but have not yet heard back.* We’re also awaiting a statement from Helton. This story will be updated as more information comes in. UPDATE: Ray and Faircloth were on administrative leave from Feb. 5-March 31."

The 33-17 vote defeating the arbitration clause nixes a major part of a deal announced less than two months ago as a major political win by Johnson’s administration with the union representing most of Chicago’s police force. The council’s rejection, and its reasoning for it, will now head back to arbitrator Edwin Benn, who earlier this year voted for the arbitration clause and could send that same ruling back to aldermen within weeks. The battle could ultimately end up in circuit court. [ City Council committee rejects discipline provision in Chicago police contract but OKs pay hikes ] In an unusual move at Johnson’s request, the arbitration matter was voted on separately from the rest of the contract, including raises for rank-and-file officers totaling 20% over four years that was approved by the full council with no debate. The lack of controversy over the financial aspect of the Fraternal Order of Police contract was another departure from how the council has acted in the past when arguments would often erupt about the cost of policing. But for this contract, the arbitration issue became the main point of disagreement. The provision would allow officers accused of misconduct to remove their cases from the Chicago Police Board docket and instead have them decided privately by an outside third party. The closed-door option was part of an arbitration award handed down earlier this year by Benn during contract negotiations between the city and FOP. The head of the FOP, John Catanzara, argued that the arbitration provision simply gave officers the same rights as many other unions in the state. But critics — including leaders of the city’s police accountability bodies — said it subverted efforts to make police misconduct proceedings more transparent. Given Benn’s previous ruling on arbitration, Catanzara has warned repeatedly that a rejection would be a waste of time and predicted the union would ultimately prevail in a costly court fight. “They want war; we’ll give you war,” Catanzara said in an interview with the Tribune following the vote. He said the union’s board was set to meet Thursday morning to discuss next steps, including legal action. But Ald. Andre Vasquez, 40th, said “there’s a fundamental difference” between other unions and the FOP. “It isn’t about hate or love or how we view it, it’s fundamental to the role itself: A plumber doesn’t have the ability to arrest anybody,” Vasquez said. “A pipe fitter doesn’t have the ability to shoot anyone.” His support of having police discipline cases heard at the Police Board is “not to villainize” police, Vasquez said, but because the most serious accusations of misconduct involve “nuance and … understanding.” It is to the FOP’s benefit to “hear it publicly because there are times where officers are making the right call,” he said. Ald. Jason Ervin, 28th, said irrespective of a potential court battle, accepting the arbitration ruling was just “not right,” echoing others who said the potential cost of a court battle was far less than the sometimes millions of dollars in police settlements aldermen approve each month. The council approved more than $10 million in settlements Wednesday. “If our rejection leads to additional back and forth, then so be it,” Ervin said. “It’s not the first fight, it won’t be the last fight. … I’m not against the FOP, I’m not against the leadership, not against the police officers. However, we have to be for what the public is calling for.” Catanzara said the FOP more than a month ago has offered the city a compromise in which the union would make public misconduct cases that were being handled privately by detailing charges against officers, the case’s status and any final adjudication. He said the offer was rejected. “They can shove their ‘transparency’ argument up their a--,” Catanzara said. “They wanted it their way or no way. They’re not about transparency. They’re about submission.” During the council debate on the arbitration issue, Ald. Silvana Tabares, 23rd, agreed with Catanzara that the council’s rejection of arbitration could lose in court. “The city’s attorney admitted — they admitted — that they are likely to be unsuccessful in court defending the blatant disregard the city has shown to the state law when it comes to how it treats Chicago Police officers,” Tabares said. [ Mayor Brandon Johnson to split Chicago police union contract into two votes, citing issue with disciplinary provisions ] The other 16 council members who supported keeping the arbitration award in the FOP contract come from some of the city’s more conservative or pro-police wards: Ald. Brian Hopkins, 2nd; Anthony Beale, 9th; Peter Chico, 10th; Nicole Lee, 11th; Marty Quinn, 13th; Raymond Lopez, 15th; Derrick Curtis, 18th; Matt O’Shea, 19th; Felix Cardona, 31st; Gilbert Villegas, 36th; Nick Sposato, 38th; Samantha Nugent, 39th; Anthony Napolitano, 41st; Brendan Reilly, 42nd; Jim Gardiner, 45th; and Debra Silverstein, 50th. Before the arbitration vote, Johnson briefly recessed the council after repeated outbursts from members of the public seated in the chamber and in the gallery on the third floor of City Hall. A handful of people were escorted out of the third floor after they banged their hands on the windows overlooking the chamber. After the meeting, Johnson told reporters the City Council’s approval and rejection votes were emblematic of the city as a whole. “There’s a way in which you can support workers and hold them accountable. That’s our responsibility,” Johnson told reporters. “It’s imperative that as a city that the people of Chicago know (their) government is working to make sure that we’re holding people accountable. And so a decision was made today to uphold the respect and regard for those who are serving on the front line with the raises that were put forth, while also making sure that we are responding to the people of Chicago who overwhelmingly want accountability.” [ FOP and city reach tentative contract deal that provides 20% raises over four years ] On the finance side of the contract OK’d by the council, language was not publicly made available until the day of the committee vote, but the agreement provides for a more than 20% raise for CPD officers, on top of a one-time $2,500 retention bonus. Johnson administration officials estimate the new provisions — including bonuses and 5% raises this year and next — would cost an additional $60 million in 2024. Those raises went above and beyond the raises negotiated by Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration in 2021. An analysis by the Better Government Association’s policy team concluded it “would be the largest package of raises for any of the city’s employee unions in modern history.” That vote cleared the City Council 43-7, with several of council’s more progressive members voting no. It’s the latest chapter in the equilibrium Johnson has tried to maintain in his handling of CPD. In his previous role as Cook County commissioner, he passed a resolution to “redirect funds from policing and incarceration to public services not administered by law enforcement.” As a candidate for mayor, he initially promised not to increase the Police Department’s budget. But in his city budget proposal, he pitched a record $2 billion in spending for the department. While granting raises, Johnson also reshuffled positions within the department to reflect his vision for public safety. He reduced the number of budgeted beat cops; boosted detective ranks, civilian positions and those dedicated to fulfilling the department’s requirements under the ongoing federal consent decree. The deal also creates a new rotation of homicide detectives who, department officials have said, will have greater ownership of the cases they investigate. The new rotation — dubbed “Homicide Teams” in the new agreement — aims to raise the CPD’s clearance rate, which for years has hovered near 50%. Detectives on the homicide teams, the first of which debuted in Area 2 on the Far South Side earlier this year, will work 10-hour shifts and will receive extra comp time for on-call hours that fall on their scheduled days off. Overtime will be available for on-call detectives, too. And while the City Council labeled the first package it approved as “economic,” that portion of the agreement contains another provision that also directly relates to CPD officer disciplinary cases. Suspensions of less than a year are meted out internally by the CPD, and the lion’s share of those cases already result in arbitration, according to the city’s Office of Inspector General. Another piece also creates a new “Peoples Court” that would allow accused officers to have their disciplinary cases adjudicated by an arbitrator in a single day. In a statement, the ACLU of Illinois said it was disappointed in the council vote on the rest of the contract, saying it “weakens accountability” for officers and noted there was a lack of transparency around the contract’s details before the committee vote. That was “especially troubling given the administration’s publicly stated support for increased accountability for police officers, in particular, and more transparency in government, in general. This contract fails to meet both aspirations, the ACLU said in the statement. The contract lasts through the end of 2027. “With the community’s trust in our public safety system on the line, the process deserved more transparency and discussion,” the ACLU said in its statement. The votes were cast as the city and Police Department remain under a sweeping federal consent decree, born out of the 2014 murder of Laquan McDonald by a CPD officer, that mandates a series of reforms within the department. The ACLU also noted the contract “reinforces the ‘code of silence’ by preventing officers from recording their conversations following shootings or other serious uses of force. Likely violating the consent decree, the contract also purports to prevent disciplinary proceedings from considering certain body-worn camera footage. Body worn cameras should be tools for increasing officer accountability — not something for officers to hide behind.” Asked to respond to criticism the contract fell short of accountability measures and in some cases, went backward, Johnson said, “Democracy prevailed. The vote was cast … a portion of the contract that obviously this body supported. The portion of the contract that they did not support, they rejected.” Meanwhile, aldermen finalized two large police misconduct settlements during Wednesday’s meeting. One was a $2 million award for the family of a man killed by Chicago police that failed in a close vote in City Council in July, while another focused on a $8.75 million settlement in another fatal police shooting. Aldermen voted 31-18 on the $2 million package that stems from the 2014 CPD slaying of Darius Cole-Garrit, a 21-year-old man who officials said pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at officers. When the council rejected the award this summer, it posed the body’s highest-profile rebuke of the city’s Law Department yet, but corporation counsel has maintained the case would be “difficult” to win should it go to trial given conflicting testimonies on whether Cole-Garrit actually had a gun. The city’s Independent Police Review Authority found the shooting justified and a semi-automatic handgun was recovered 20 feet from Cole-Garrit, but fingerprint testing was inadequate. The $8.75 million settlement will go to the family of Michael Craig, a 61-year-old man who was killed by a Chicago cop in 2021 after he called 911 to report his wife threatening him at knife point. Upon arrival, body camera footage shows, Craig was shot instead. “I believe the justice of this settlement is unimpeachable,” Ald. Daniel La Spata, 1st, said of the $8.75 million settlement. While he noted most victims of domestic violence are women, he said “what we are spending next year on retention bonuses (for CPD) is double what we have ever spent on gender based violence in any given year.”"

The suspect, identified only as a “Black male,” was shot with a gun once, treated at the scene and hospitalized, according to a news release from the Joliet Police Department. According to the release, police went to the residence in the 1100 block of North Center Street at 8:41 a.m. after getting multiple 911 calls “indicating that a Black male suspect was outside of a residence holding a handgun, at times pointing it at the residence.” According to the release from Joliet police: “While officers were en route, it was learned that the suspect had forcibly entered the residence by breaking a window to the back door. An officer arrived on scene and encountered the suspect in the rear of the residence. “The suspect ignored numerous commands from the officer to drop the handgun. The suspect then began walking toward the officer, at which time the officer discharged their department-issued firearm twice, striking the suspect one time.” Additional officers arrived and provided medical aid to the suspect before he was taken to a local hospital by the Joliet Fire Department, police said. A handgun was recovered at the scene, police said. The officer involved in the shooting also was taken to a local hospital in accordance with police department policy, according to the release. The Will Grundy Major Crimes Task Force, which investigates local police-involved shootings, was notified and is investigating the Center Street incident, according to the release."

ALBANS, W.Va. — An investigation is underway after an officer involved shooting early Wednesday morning in St. Albans left a suspect dead. Sheriff’s Deputies said the shooting involved two officers from the Nitro Police Department and one officer from the St. Albans Police Department. The officers were dispatched to a call at a home on Lincoln Avenue in St. Albans just after midnight Wednesday morning for a report of domestic violence. When officers arrived, the 53-year old man was armed with a knife and refused commands by officers to drop the weapon and stand down. According to the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Department, the officers at first attempted to use non-lethal force to subdue the man. However, the taser used on him was ineffective and he kept advancing on the officers with the kinfe. All three officers resorted to firearms to stop the threat. Investigaors said all three officers discharged their weapons in the incident. No officers were injured and an investigation continues at the scene. The Nitro and St. Albans Police Departments are conducting internal investigations and the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the criminal part of the case. “The officers did what they should have done from preliminary indications,” said Kanawha County Chief Deputy Joe Crawford speaking with MetroNews affilaite 580-WCHS Radio. “They attempted to use non-lethal force and ultimately ended up having to use deadly force.” Names of the individuals involved have not been released. The Sheriff’s Department will compile findings and evidence in the case and present the matter to the Kanawha County Prosecutors office to determine if charges are warranted or if the shooting was justified."

In 2023 alone, FX aired a five-part docuseries on him, at least three different writers authored books about him, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a long-overdue arrest and indictment has finally been made in his murder investigation. I’ve thought a lot about Shakur, beginning in the 1990s when I was a teenage fan of his music and more recently during the four years I’ve spent researching, writing, and promoting my book, An Amerikan Family: The Shakurs and the Nation They Created. During this time, I’ve become increasingly convinced that the public continues to overlook Shakur’s greatest legacy: that of a messenger steeped in the Black prophetic tradition, blending spirituality and liberation theology with social justice advocacy—conveying principled messages meant to deliver Black people in this life and thereafter. To be sure, Tupac Shakur was an imperfect messenger. He was brash, profane, and often vulgar. He faced repeated arrest and incarceration for alleged assault and other offenses. He drank liquor, smoked blunts, and celebrated promiscuity. But Shakur at the same time was a harsh critic of police brutality, he advocated for women’s reproductive rights, and condemned wealth inequality in America. More than anything, he was deeply committed to his core demographic: young Black men. To Shakur, young Black men were lost sheep in the wilderness of North America—banished and besieged, feared and misunderstood—and he longed to be their redeemer, even if it meant offering his own life as a cautionary tale. If Shakur could be said to have a creed or doctrine, it would be the doctrine of Thug Life. Many people assumed he was promoting hooliganism, but, Shakur explained, Thug Life was an acronym for “The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody”—meaning the injustices children face at a young age have repercussions on society at large. Thug Life, to Shakur, was his way of reaching his folks where they were at, without judgment or reproach. “Young Black males out there identify with Thug Life because I’m not trying to clean them up,” he said. “I am, but I’m not saying come to me clean. I’m saying come as you are.” In 1962, over a decade before Shakur was born, the writer James Baldwin reflected on his brief stint as a child preacher at a Pentecostal church in Harlem. In his essay, “Letter from a Region in My Mind,” first published by the New Yorker and later reprinted in his landmark book, The Fire Next Time, Baldwin describes what he’d perceived as the hypocrisy, arrogance, and gospel of submissiveness endorsed by the Black Church, and the feeling that the church had abandoned the urgent needs of the people, encouraging them “to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.” He wondered why they couldn’t organize around something tangible, like “a rent strike,” and he asked: “Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?” Thirty years later, Shakur’s 1993 song, “I Wonda if Heaven’s Got a Ghetto,” has clear parallels to Baldwin’s essay. The song, a B-side to his anthemic single “Keep Ya Head Up,” contrasts the pie-in-the-sky promises of the church to the real-life ills facing his community: police brutality, poverty, drug addiction, and other ills. Unlike Baldwin, though, Shakur seems to be asking not if heaven will replicate the same segregated and deplorable conditions as America’s inner cities, but whether heaven will welcome with open arms all the subjugated people who suffered, struggled, and rebelled against their conditions. Early on in his career, Shakur realized that when the church fails to reach the people most in need, it’s the militants, hustlers, or entertainers who will fill that need, and he would embrace all three roles interchangeably. At the same time, Shakur didn’t shy away from rebuking the church for not doing enough to address his community’s needs. In a 1996 VIBE interview, he acts as an interrogator of the church and its function in society: “If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we’d be a’ight,” Shakur says. “Have you seen one of these goddamn churches lately? It’s ones that take up the whole block in New York. It’s homeless people out here. Why ain’t God lettin’ them stay there? Why these n****s got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?” Consciously or not, Shakur’s demands for the church and society at large to pay attention to the unmet needs of Black Americans links him directly to the Black prophetic tradition, exemplified not only by Baldwin, but also Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and many others. The Black prophetic tradition, with roots that date back to the arrival of enslaved Africans to the American colonies, is a rhetorical tradition, rooted in (but not confined by) the Black Church, bearing witness to injustice, speaking truth to power, and boldly condemning White supremacy. The role of the prophet—from the days of Jonah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Hosea, and Daniel, to today—is not to mollify but to rebuke a nation that has deviated from principles of justice and righteousness. Black prophetic fire is a forewarning of grim and dire consequences, both for America and the world, if Black and other marginalized people continue to be persecuted. As the theologian James H. Cone writes in his 1970 book, A Black Theology of Liberation, “The black prophet is a rebel with a cause, the cause of over twenty-five million black Americans and all oppressed persons everywhere.” This, to me, defines Tupac Shakur. In the many hours I’ve spent reexamining his music and listening closely to his words, I’ve come to appreciate him beyond his reputation as a brash and hotheaded young nihilist. The recent influx of products, programs, and conversations related to Shakur proves I’m not alone in this reconsideration and recognition. Shakur was a bearer of difficult truths, a fiery and zealous critic of injustice, and a fierce advocate for the liberation and deliverance of the downtrodden. These are the responsibilities of the prophet. The prophet’s role is not to power over the people but to empower people to better themselves and envision a better world. “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world,” Shakur said, “but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” Nearly three decades after his death, Shakur’s millions of listeners across the world—young fans and oldheads like myself—continue to parse Shakur’s words, as though conducting biblical exegesis, seeking meaning and inspiration in his lyrics and interviews. As Black American men are killed by police officers at a staggering rate, as the gulf between rich and poor grows wider, and as drug addiction and overdose deaths continue to disproportionately affect communities of color, Shakur’s words remain as relevant and important—indeed as prophetic—as ever before. Santi Elijah Holley is a journalist and the author of An Amerikan Family: The Shakurs and the Nation They Created. He lives in Los Angeles."

On Monday, the Finance Committee advanced the award for the family of Darius Cole-Garrit, a 21-year-old man fatally shot by police in 2014 after officials said he pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at officers. Aldermen who voted no were Chris Taliaferro, 29th, Bill Conway, 34th, Matthew O’Shea, 19th, Debra Silverstein, 50th, Marty Quinn, 13th, Nicholas Sposato, 38th, Derrick Curtis, 18th, and Brian Hopkins, 2nd. The full City Council will take up the item on Wednesday, the second time it will consider the settlement this year. In July, the same amount was rejected in a 26-22 vote, the body’s most notable pushback to a Chicago Police Department settlement award under the Johnson administration. At the time, aldermen in opposition voiced long-running frustrations with how the council handles police settlements, which cost the city more than $100 million last year. The settlement was scheduled to come up for another vote in September, but Finance Chair Ald. Pat Dowell pulled it from the committee at the last minute, saying the delay was “to allow the Law Department to do some more work.” On Monday, Dowell, 3rd, had more to say, reminding colleagues of particulars of the shooting that she said “gave us an indication about how difficult this case would be to win.” “I believe that it’s in the city’s best interest to settle this. This is not like the black-and-white kind of case,” Dowell said. “A lot of outstanding concerns. And so I would ask that we maintain our fiduciary duty as counsel and pass this settlement agreement.” The 2016 lawsuit in question surrounds the fatal police shooting of Cole-Garrit, who was biking down 133rd Street on the Far South Side when he was pulled over by Chicago police officers in an unmarked vehicle who were investigating a weapons tip. Cole-Garrit ditched his bike and ran, the city’s corporation counsel John Hendricks said Monday, leading two of the cops to chase him on foot. One cop fired 11 shots, while another fired nine, killing Cole-Garrit, Hendricks said, but “there are up until that point multiple disagreements, or multiple facts, in dispute about what took place.” “(There are) very different versions of the story, radically so that the plaintiffs claim there was actually no gun. The police officers claimed that in fact a gun was pointed at one of them,” Hendricks said. “In short, this is a difficult case factually.” Hendricks said even among the cops testifying, there were “conflicting stories” about Cole-Garrit pointing a gun at them, on top of only one eyewitness who observed the shooting and “supports the deceased’s version of the facts.” And, should the settlement fail and the case go to trial, the award could double or triple, he added. The city’s Independent Police Review Authority found the shooting justified, and a semi-automatic handgun was recovered 20 feet from Cole-Garrit. But fingerprint testing was inadequate because there were too many smudges, Hendricks said. “One of the big disputes here: there were obviously officers who allege they saw the gun and saw it aimed at least one officer, but there are other witnesses who claimed there was no gun, and that the presumption is that maybe it was planted,” Hendricks said. But Hopkins, who voted against the settlement before, said the Law Department ought to be more bullish on its “very strong case to make.” “This is a difficult case and a difficult decision, as many of these cases are,” Hopkins said. “But the fact that they want this settlement and seem to be averse to a trial, is that a possible indication that plaintiff’s counsel does not have as much confidence as they would like us to think?” The Finance Committee also approved an $8.75 million settlement Monday to the family of Michael Craig, a 61-year-old man who was killed by a cop in 2021 after he called 911 to report his wife threatening him at knife point. Police body camera footage shows two people struggling before a gunshot is heard, Law Department counsel Caroline Fronczak said. Craig was then on the ground for two seconds before a second shot went off, she said. An autopsy showed he died of two gunshot wounds and also suffered nonfatal defensive stab wounds. “The Department of Law believes the potential exposure in this case is reasonably high, given the 911 calls identifying that the female was the one that was threatening the husband with the knife,” Fronczak said. And the committee approved a $515,000 settlement to Chicago firefighter James Mundo, stemming from a workplace harassment suit in which he alleged his supervisor made inappropriate comments about his sexual orientation. Meanwhile, the council’s ethics committee approved changes Monday to ease lobbyist registration requirements for nonprofits following years of negotiations. As part of a suite of reforms to ethics rules in the early months of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s tenure, the council required nonprofit lobbyists register with the city and report their activities each quarter. Supporters argued it was an important transparency measure that let the public know who was working to sway council members, the mayor and department heads. But after an uproar from nonprofit leaders about the cost of compliance for smaller organizations and a chilling effect the rules might have on participation in city programs and projects, implementation of that portion of the ordinance was repeatedly delayed. Among the changes: Individuals only need to register if the nonprofit they lobby for “has both an operating budget and net assets or fund balances of five million dollars or more.” Lobbying fees would be capped at $20,000, and those who participate in grassroots lobbying events — like sending mass emails to members of council — would also be exempt. Steve Berlin, the executive director of the Board of Ethics, said the changes still put Chicago “well within the fold of its peer cities” like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Philadelphia. So far, 122 people have registered as nonprofit lobbyists. If passed, the ordinance would take effect in July 2024. ayin@chicagotribune.com aquig@chicagotribune.com"

I’m saying come as you are.” In 1962, over a decade before Shakur was born, the writer James Baldwin reflected on his brief stint as a child preacher at a Pentecostal church in Harlem. In his essay, “Letter from a Region in My Mind,” first published by the New Yorker and later reprinted in his landmark book, The Fire Next Time, Baldwin describes what he’d perceived as the hypocrisy, arrogance, and gospel of submissiveness endorsed by the Black Church, and the feeling that the church had abandoned the urgent needs of the people, encouraging them “to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.” He wondered why they couldn’t organize around something tangible, like “a rent strike,” and he asked: “Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?” Thirty years later, Shakur’s 1993 song, “I Wonda if Heaven’s Got a Ghetto,” has clear parallels to Baldwin’s essay. The song, a B-side to his anthemic single “Keep Ya Head Up,” contrasts the pie-in-the-sky promises of the church to the real-life ills facing his community: police brutality, poverty, drug addiction, and other ills. Unlike Baldwin, though, Shakur seems to be asking not if heaven will replicate the same segregated and deplorable conditions as America’s inner cities, but whether heaven will welcome with open arms all the subjugated people who suffered, struggled, and rebelled against their conditions. Early on in his career, Shakur realized that when the church fails to reach the people most in need, it’s the militants, hustlers, or entertainers who will fill that need, and he would embrace all three roles interchangeably. At the same time, Shakur didn’t shy away from rebuking the church for not doing enough to address his community’s needs. In a 1996 VIBE interview, he acts as an interrogator of the church and its function in society: “If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we’d be a’ight,” Shakur says. “Have you seen one of these goddamn churches lately? It’s ones that take up the whole block in New York. It’s homeless people out here. Why ain’t God lettin’ them stay there? Why these n****s got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?” Consciously or not, Shakur’s demands for the church and society at large to pay attention to the unmet needs of Black Americans links him directly to the Black prophetic tradition, exemplified not only by Baldwin, but also Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and many others. The Black prophetic tradition, with roots that date back to the arrival of enslaved Africans to the American colonies, is a rhetorical tradition, rooted in (but not confined by) the Black Church, bearing witness to injustice, speaking truth to power, and boldly condemning White supremacy. The role of the prophet—from the days of Jonah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Hosea, and Daniel, to today—is not to mollify but to rebuke a nation that has deviated from principles of justice and righteousness. Black prophetic fire is a forewarning of grim and dire consequences, both for America and the world, if Black and other marginalized people continue to be persecuted. As the theologian James H. Cone writes in his 1970 book, A Black Theology of Liberation, “The black prophet is a rebel with a cause, the cause of over twenty-five million black Americans and all oppressed persons everywhere.” This, to me, defines Tupac Shakur. In the many hours I’ve spent reexamining his music and listening closely to his words, I’ve come to appreciate him beyond his reputation as a brash and hotheaded young nihilist. The recent influx of products, programs, and conversations related to Shakur proves I’m not alone in this reconsideration and recognition. Shakur was a bearer of difficult truths, a fiery and zealous critic of injustice, and a fierce advocate for the liberation and deliverance of the downtrodden. These are the responsibilities of the prophet. The prophet’s role is not to power over the people but to empower people to better themselves and envision a better world. “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world,” Shakur said, “but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” Nearly three decades after his death, Shakur’s millions of listeners across the world—young fans and oldheads like myself—continue to parse Shakur’s words, as though conducting biblical exegesis, seeking meaning and inspiration in his lyrics and interviews. As Black American men are killed by police officers at a staggering rate, as the gulf between rich and poor grows wider, and as drug addiction and overdose deaths continue to disproportionately affect communities of color, Shakur’s words remain as relevant and important—indeed as prophetic—as ever before.

The family of Jawan Dallas, 36, alleges that Mobile police used excessive force that led to his death. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Mobile, names the city and two unnamed officers as defendants. It seeks $36 million in damages. Dallas, 36, died July 2 after he was shocked with a stun gun while police were trying to subdue him. FAMILY OF ALABAMA MAN WHO WAS KILLED BY POLICE ASKS CITY TO RELEASE BODYCAM FOOTAGE “He was assaulted multiple times, struck multiple times and tasered multiple times,” attorney Harry Daniels said during a Monday news conference announcing the lawsuit. The district attorney announced last month that a grand jury cleared the officers of criminal wrongdoing and said Dallas died of underlying medical conditions that were exacerbated by drug use and the struggle with officers. Attorneys for the family said the body camera footage, which was viewed by the family last month, shows that officers used excessive force. Family attorneys urged the police department to publicly release the video. The lawsuit also contends that officers had no reason to try to detain Dallas and that he was under no suspicion of criminal wrongdoing at the time of the confrontation. ALABAMA POLICE OFFICER ON LEAVE AFTER VIDEO SHOWS HER USING STUN GUN ON HANDCUFFED MAN Officers approached Dallas after they responded to a possible burglary report at a trailer park when a 911 caller reported that a “homeless guy” was in his yard. Police approached Dallas, who was in his vehicle at another trailer, and another man who was in the yard at the home. According to the lawsuit, an officer demanded Dallas get out of the car and produce his identification. Dallas had told the officers that they were violating his rights, and he attempted to flee on foot at some point but was tackled by an officer, the lawsuit said. Attorneys said Dallas can be heard in the body camera video screaming, begging for help and at one point saying, “I canât breathe. I donât want to be George Floyd.” The Dallas family is represented by attorneys Daniels, John Burrus, Ben Crump and Lee Merritt, who have represented families in a number of high-profile cases where Black people have died during confrontations with police. ALABAMA POLICE RELEASE BODY CAMERA RECORDING OF CONFRONTATION THAT INVOLVED STUN GUN, BATON The lawsuit accuses the city’s police chief of trying to present a “false narrative to the public” in a press conference to justify officers questioning Dallas. The city of Mobile sent out a statement late Monday saying the chief relayed information that had been provided by the 911 caller. The city released a transcript of the 911 call reporting a possible burglary in which the caller said the person was wearing a red shirt or pants and had walked up the road to what “looked like trailer 27.” The city said Dallas was wearing red shorts and was near trailer 27 when police approached him."

Families of eight of the American hostages in Gaza asked for an invitation to the White House Hanukkah celebration, but the White House ignored them. These families are desperate and are even asking the White House to make a side-deal with Hamas or cut Israel out of negotiations altogether, which may be why the White House didn’t want them at the celebration. 6. A police shooting of Jawan Dallas in Mobile, where neither of the officers involved was charged after a grand jury investigated the matter, is the subject of a $36 million lawsuit involving “racial justice” attorney Ben Crump. There are multiple police-related matters in the state of Alabama right now including a police officer tasing a handcuffed suspect in Reform and the ongoing matter of Stephen Perkins’ death in Decatur. 5. Special Counsel Jack Smith is now attempting to get the Supreme Court to rule on the issue of presidential immunity for former President Donald Trump to keep his desired timeline for the trial’s start in early March. This is not the first time prosecutors have conveniently acted days after a Biden legal issue was dominating the headlines. 4. U.S. Sen. Katie Britt (R-Montgomery) is cementing her place as a player in Washington, D.C., and American politics after she endorsed former President Donald Trump last week and she has now announced that she has raised $500,000 for her fellow Senate Republicans. Britt noted, “In the next 11 months, I will continue to do everything within my power to support Republican victories up-and-down the ballot. This includes making sure that good candidates have the resources needed to get their winning messages out to the public. We need to build a team of people who will work together to save the country we know and love.” 3. Talk of gambling in Alabama is starting to gain steam as the year winds down, with State Sen. Sam Givhan (R-Huntsville), hardly a gambling fan, saying that the “absurdities” of “monopoly or an oligopoly to a very limited number of people” are being removed and people are being more intellectually honest. There is also talk of a mid-session special session to deal with the issue of gaming with money going to a Medicaid expansion and/or school choice. 2. U.S. Rep. Dale Strong (R-Monrovia) has inserted language about a border wall that would require that the allocated materials that are currently being stored be used to help build parts of it. The bill notes that there is currently $300 million worth of material that the Biden administration decided to store at $25 million instead of using the material to build the wall in places where illegals are crossing with impunity. 1.

Around 8 a.m. Sunday, SBPD officers responded to an apartment after someone called 911 to report the armed woman. The caller said the woman was inside an apartment and was holding a gun to the head of the caller’s 3-year-old grandson. The woman was not related to the child, officials said, and the caller said she had already fired off the gun at least once. When police arrived on the scene they found the woman, whom they described as “very distraught,” standing on a balcony and pointing a gun at the caller. She also pointed the weapon at an officer, police said. The woman then retreated into the apartment where the child was still inside and locked the door. Officers kicked the door down, where they found the woman standing on a bed inside the living room, pointing a gun at the child who was below her and crying. At least one officer fired at the woman, striking her, but she continued to hold the gun, police said. Officers ordered her to drop the weapon, but she allegedly refused and instead pointed the gun at the child once more. That’s when police opened fire again, striking the woman another time, this time fatally. Officers removed the child from the apartment and began first aid on the suspect, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. She’s been identified as Darvet Brown, a 35-year-old resident of San Bernardino. Brown had no relation to the child and police say her “behavior is not fully understood at this time.” The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information about the incident is urged to contact SBPD Detective Chavez via email."

(WKRG) — Attorneys in the Jawan Dallas case have responded to the 911 transcripts released as part of the investigation. Jawan Dallas, a 36-year-old Black man, died after officers with the Mobile Police Department tased him. The City of Mobile released the 911 call that led to that incident after the Executive Director of Public Safety, Robert Lasky, said attorney Harry Daniels provided “a false narrative” during a press conference Monday. The 911 call transcripts showed that “MPD officers approached Dallas in connection with a July 2 disturbance despite the fact that he did not clear the suspect description given to them and dispatch,” according to a news release from Wukela Communications. The 911 caller reported someone trespassing in his yard and described the person as “that skinny black dude, a thin one… He’s homeless, they squattin’ over here on some property.” Meanwhile, Dallas’ attorneys said he weighed about 193 pounds and was approached while sitting in his vehicle. Mobile Police Chief Paul Prine said in a press conference on July 7 that the caller had described the suspect as “wearing either a red shirt or red shorts;” however, the caller described the man as “wearing a hat, red shirt, possible red pants.” “These officers should have been looking for a skinny homeless man wearing a red shirt, pants and a hat. Instead they zeroed in on Jawan Dallas who was far from skinny wearing a white shirt, shorts and no hat,” said Daniels. “The only thing he shared with the suspect was that they were both Black men. But that was enough for these officers because they approached him, they assaulted him and they killed him.” On Monday, Lasky said, “The City of Mobile does not typically comment on pending litigation. However, we find ourselves in the unusual position of having to correct a false narrative portrayed publicly by attorney Harry Daniels in a press conference earlier today. “During his comments, Mr. Daniels called into question the character of our police chief by claiming he lied to the public about the events leading up to the confrontation between Jawan Dallas and two Mobile police officers on July 2, 2023. Because the statements made by Mr. Daniels are inciteful and false, it is our opinion that it serves a public interest to release the 911 call and the subsequent dispatch of two of our police officers to a reported burglary in progress on July 2, 2023. These transcripts speak for themselves. “The information provided by the operator to the 911 Caller and the responding officers was the same information that Chief Paul Prine relayed to the media and the members of the public during his press conference on July 7, 2023.” The Dallas family filed a $36 million lawsuit against the officer involved and the city. They are being represented by attorneys Harry Daniels, John Burris, Ben Crump, Lee Merritt and Roderick Van Daniels.

In 2023 alone, FX aired a five-part docuseries on him, at least three different writers authored books about him, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a long-overdue arrest and indictment has finally been made in his murder investigation. I’ve thought a lot about Shakur, beginning in the 1990s when I was a teenage fan of his music and more recently during the four years I’ve spent researching, writing, and promoting my book, An Amerikan Family: The Shakurs and the Nation They Created. During this time, I’ve become increasingly convinced that the public continues to overlook Shakur’s greatest legacy: that of a messenger steeped in the Black prophetic tradition, blending spirituality and liberation theology with social justice advocacy—conveying principled messages meant to deliver Black people in this life and thereafter. To be sure, Tupac Shakur was an imperfect messenger. He was brash, profane, and often vulgar. He faced repeated arrest and incarceration for alleged assault and other offenses. He drank liquor, smoked blunts, and celebrated promiscuity. But Shakur at the same time was a harsh critic of police brutality, he advocated for women’s reproductive rights, and condemned wealth inequality in America. More than anything, he was deeply committed to his core demographic: young Black men. To Shakur, young Black men were lost sheep in the wilderness of North America—banished and besieged, feared and misunderstood—and he longed to be their redeemer, even if it meant offering his own life as a cautionary tale. If Shakur could be said to have a creed or doctrine, it would be the doctrine of Thug Life. Many people assumed he was promoting hooliganism, but, Shakur explained, Thug Life was an acronym for “The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody”—meaning the injustices children face at a young age have repercussions on society at large. Thug Life, to Shakur, was his way of reaching his folks where they were at, without judgment or reproach. “Young Black males out there identify with Thug Life because I’m not trying to clean them up,” he said. “I am, but I’m not saying come to me clean. I’m saying come as you are.” In 1962, over a decade before Shakur was born, the writer James Baldwin reflected on his brief stint as a child preacher at a Pentecostal church in Harlem. In his essay, “Letter from a Region in My Mind,” first published by the New Yorker and later reprinted in his landmark book, The Fire Next Time, Baldwin describes what he’d perceived as the hypocrisy, arrogance, and gospel of submissiveness endorsed by the Black Church, and the feeling that the church had abandoned the urgent needs of the people, encouraging them “to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.” He wondered why they couldn’t organize around something tangible, like “a rent strike,” and he asked: “Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?” Thirty years later, Shakur’s 1993 song, “I Wonda if Heaven’s Got a Ghetto,” has clear parallels to Baldwin’s essay. The song, a B-side to his anthemic single “Keep Ya Head Up,” contrasts the pie-in-the-sky promises of the church to the real-life ills facing his community: police brutality, poverty, drug addiction, and other ills. Unlike Baldwin, though, Shakur seems to be asking not if heaven will replicate the same segregated and deplorable conditions as America’s inner cities, but whether heaven will welcome with open arms all the subjugated people who suffered, struggled, and rebelled against their conditions. Early on in his career, Shakur realized that when the church fails to reach the people most in need, it’s the militants, hustlers, or entertainers who will fill that need, and he would embrace all three roles interchangeably. At the same time, Shakur didn’t shy away from rebuking the church for not doing enough to address his community’s needs. In a 1996 VIBE interview, he acts as an interrogator of the church and its function in society: “If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we’d be a’ight,” Shakur says. “Have you seen one of these goddamn churches lately? It’s ones that take up the whole block in New York. It’s homeless people out here. Why ain’t God lettin’ them stay there? Why these n****s got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?” Consciously or not, Shakur’s demands for the church and society at large to pay attention to the unmet needs of Black Americans links him directly to the Black prophetic tradition, exemplified not only by Baldwin, but also Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and many others. The Black prophetic tradition, with roots that date back to the arrival of enslaved Africans to the American colonies, is a rhetorical tradition, rooted in (but not confined by) the Black Church, bearing witness to injustice, speaking truth to power, and boldly condemning White supremacy.

It’s easy to fall back into a life surrounded by gangs, drugs and violence in the streets of Chicago after being released from prison, Juan Romero wrote in an essay from the four walls of his cell as he tried to understand how he landed there and how he could find his way out. “It’s the only way of life we know,” said Romero, 36, now a free man. Last week, a little over four years after serving his sentence, he adorned the hood of the semi-truck he drives for work with an image of ‘La Guadalupana’ — the Virgin Mary — to partake in the annual procession of truckers from Chicago’s South Side to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Des Plaines. The convoy celebrates their faith and gratitude for answered prayers throughout the year. Since he was released from prison in October 2019, Romero commemorates the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe every December with hundreds of other truckers in a pilgrimage the weekend preceding the holiday, on Dec 12. They join thousands of devotees who visit the shrine walking, running, biking and horse riding, making the Midwest celebration the second largest one after Mexico City and the Des Plaines shrine the most visited monument of its kind in the U.S. This year, the Archdiocese of Chicago expects 400,000 people to visit the shrine, which houses the first replica of the sacred tilma — cloak — with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Before it was brought to the Chicago area, the Des Plaines icon was touched to the original image and blessed at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City.

Under proposed agreement, state would drop enforcement of law aimed at deterring deceptive anti-abortion practices If finalized and signed by a federal judge, the agreement to make the judge’s decision permanent would mark a rare victory for anti-abortion groups in a deep blue state with some of the nation’s strongest reproductive rights laws, and a blow to Pritzker, who signed the measure into law last summer and who has promoted Illinois as a national beacon for abortion rights.

In 2023 alone, FX aired a five-part docuseries on him, at least three different writers authored books about him, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a long-overdue arrest and indictment has finally been made in his murder investigation. I’ve thought a lot about Shakur, beginning in the 1990s when I was a teenage fan of his music and more recently during the four years I’ve spent researching, writing, and promoting my book, An Amerikan Family: The Shakurs and the Nation They Created. During this time, I’ve become increasingly convinced that the public continues to overlook Shakur’s greatest legacy: that of a messenger steeped in the Black prophetic tradition, blending spirituality and liberation theology with social justice advocacy—conveying principled messages meant to deliver Black people in this life and thereafter. To be sure, Tupac Shakur was an imperfect messenger. He was brash, profane, and often vulgar. He faced repeated arrest and incarceration for alleged assault and other offenses. He drank liquor, smoked blunts, and celebrated promiscuity. But Shakur at the same time was a harsh critic of police brutality, he advocated for women’s reproductive rights, and condemned wealth inequality in America. More than anything, he was deeply committed to his core demographic: young Black men. To Shakur, young Black men were lost sheep in the wilderness of North America—banished and besieged, feared and misunderstood—and he longed to be their redeemer, even if it meant offering his own life as a cautionary tale. If Shakur could be said to have a creed or doctrine, it would be the doctrine of Thug Life. Many people assumed he was promoting hooliganism, but, Shakur explained, Thug Life was an acronym for “The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody”—meaning the injustices children face at a young age have repercussions on society at large. Thug Life, to Shakur, was his way of reaching his folks where they were at, without judgment or reproach. “Young Black males out there identify with Thug Life because I’m not trying to clean them up,” he said. “I am, but I’m not saying come to me clean. I’m saying come as you are.” In 1962, over a decade before Shakur was born, the writer James Baldwin reflected on his brief stint as a child preacher at a Pentecostal church in Harlem. In his essay, “Letter from a Region in My Mind,” first published by the New Yorker and later reprinted in his landmark book, The Fire Next Time, Baldwin describes what he’d perceived as the hypocrisy, arrogance, and gospel of submissiveness endorsed by the Black Church, and the feeling that the church had abandoned the urgent needs of the people, encouraging them “to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.” He wondered why they couldn’t organize around something tangible, like “a rent strike,” and he asked: “Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?” Thirty years later, Shakur’s 1993 song, “I Wonda if Heaven’s Got a Ghetto,” has clear parallels to Baldwin’s essay. The song, a B-side to his anthemic single “Keep Ya Head Up,” contrasts the pie-in-the-sky promises of the church to the real-life ills facing his community: police brutality, poverty, drug addiction, and other ills. Unlike Baldwin, though, Shakur seems to be asking not if heaven will replicate the same segregated and deplorable conditions as America’s inner cities, but whether heaven will welcome with open arms all the subjugated people who suffered, struggled, and rebelled against their conditions. Early on in his career, Shakur realized that when the church fails to reach the people most in need, it’s the militants, hustlers, or entertainers who will fill that need, and he would embrace all three roles interchangeably. At the same time, Shakur didn’t shy away from rebuking the church for not doing enough to address his community’s needs. In a 1996 VIBE interview, he acts as an interrogator of the church and its function in society: “If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we’d be a’ight,” Shakur says. “Have you seen one of these goddamn churches lately? It’s ones that take up the whole block in New York. It’s homeless people out here. Why ain’t God lettin’ them stay there? Why these n****s got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?” Consciously or not, Shakur’s demands for the church and society at large to pay attention to the unmet needs of Black Americans links him directly to the Black prophetic tradition, exemplified not only by Baldwin, but also Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and many others. The Black prophetic tradition, with roots that date back to the arrival of enslaved Africans to the American colonies, is a rhetorical tradition, rooted in (but not confined by) the Black Church, bearing witness to injustice, speaking truth to power, and boldly condemning White supremacy. The role of the prophet—from the days of Jonah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Hosea, and Daniel, to today—is not to mollify but to rebuke a nation that has deviated from principles of justice and righteousness. Black prophetic fire is a forewarning of grim and dire consequences, both for America and the world, if Black and other marginalized people continue to be persecuted. As the theologian James H. Cone writes in his 1970 book, A Black Theology of Liberation, “The black prophet is a rebel with a cause, the cause of over twenty-five million black Americans and all oppressed persons everywhere.” This, to me, defines Tupac Shakur. In the many hours I’ve spent reexamining his music and listening closely to his words, I’ve come to appreciate him beyond his reputation as a brash and hotheaded young nihilist. The recent influx of products, programs, and conversations related to Shakur proves I’m not alone in this reconsideration and recognition. Shakur was a bearer of difficult truths, a fiery and zealous critic of injustice, and a fierce advocate for the liberation and deliverance of the downtrodden. These are the responsibilities of the prophet. The prophet’s role is not to power over the people but to empower people to better themselves and envision a better world. “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world,” Shakur said, “but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” Nearly three decades after his death, Shakur’s millions of listeners across the world—young fans and oldheads like myself—continue to parse Shakur’s words, as though conducting biblical exegesis, seeking meaning and inspiration in his lyrics and interviews. As Black American men are killed by police officers at a staggering rate, as the gulf between rich and poor grows wider, and as drug addiction and overdose deaths continue to disproportionately affect communities of color, Shakur’s words remain as relevant and important—indeed as prophetic—as ever before.

Investigations Bureau agents learned that at around 9:30 p.m., a GPD officer was called to a disturbance at 200 Western Skies Road. A 21-year-old male from Gallup, was asked to leave the residence and refused to do so. As the GPD officer approached the male suspect, the male walked back to a silver Toyota Camry, opened the door to the vehicle, and a handgun fell to the ground.Â The suspect picked the gun up, took a fighting stance, and racked the slide of the handgun. He then got into the vehicle and fled the scene, initiating a pursuit. The pursuit was terminated by GPD once the vehicle left the city limits. A GPD lieutenant then observed a vehicle matching the description of the Toyota, and a second pursuit was initiated. A New Mexico State Police officer who was in the area, was able to successfully deploy stop sticks on Interstate 40 near mile marker 25.Â The vehicle exited the Interstate and drove into a Blakeâs Lotaburger restaurant parking lot in Gallup and fled on foot. While fleeing on foot, the suspect attempted to steal a white Jeep that was in the parking lot. A GPD sergeant witnessed the suspect attempting to steal the Jeep. At some point during the encounter, the GPD sergeant discharged at least one round from his duty weapon, striking the suspect. The suspect was transported to an area hospital, then flown to a hospital in Albuquerque. His condition is unknown. No officers were injured during this incident.Â The GPD officer involved will not be identified by the New Mexico State Police. For information on their duty status or administrative actions taken, please contact the Gallup Police Department. For information regarding charges for the suspect, please contact the Gallup Police Department.Â New Mexico State Police Investigations Bureau agents are working to independently determine the series of events leading to the shooting, including collecting evidence and conducting interviews. Throughout the process, investigative findings will be shared with the district attorney for review. The New Mexico State Police acts solely as a factfinder in its cases and does not determine whether an officerâs actions were justified in these types of matters. That decision rests with the district attorneyâs office. This incident remains under investigation by the New Mexico State Police."

According to AP News, the court filing alleges several incidents where Palmer âsuffered physical and emotional abuse at the handsâ of Jackson. âOn Sunday, November 5, Darius trespassed into my home, physically attacked me, knocked me over my couch and pinned me down, and stole my phone after I threatened to call the police. This was all caught on home surveillance video,â the filing read. When Black women around the country yell, âprotect Black women,â it isnât just for the fun of it. As news surrounding Keke Palmer and Cassie has become public knowledge, one thing has become clearer: Now is the time to protect Black women. The relationship between Palmer and Jackson started back in June 2021 and ended in October 2023; it also bore their son, Leodis Andrellton Jackson, for whom Palmer is seeking sole legal custody. The filing details an incident of Jackson allegedly âgetting roughâ with their child while changing his diaper, according to The Hollywood Reporter. âGiven Dariusâ uncontrolled, violent outbursts in the past whenever he became jealous, I became seriously concerned he would hurt our son, even if it was just to hurt me,â Palmer says in the declaration. After Palmer stepped in resulting in a âtug of warâ action with the child, Jackson eventually allowed Palmer to finish the diaper change. As she was finishing up, Palmer claims Jackson hit her on the head before leaving the room, according to Daily Mail. Unfortunately, news of Palmerâs alleged abuse hasnât been the only maltreatment against Black women exposed in the limelight. On November 16, singer and songwriter Casandra Venturaâfamously known as Cassieâfiled a lawsuit against media mogul, Sean âDiddyâ Combs. Page Six reports that the suit alleges their decade-long relationship included rape, sex trafficking, and beatings. âAfter years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story,â Ventura said, according to AP News, âTo speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships.â The suit, which came with a trigger warning attached, states that Diddy âsavagelyâ beat Cassie, gave her drugs, and forced her to have sexual intercourse with various men as he watched, filmed, and masturbated. âIn 2018, the suit says, near the end of their relationship, Mr. Combs forced his way into her home and raped her,â according to The New York Times. The National Coalition against Domestic Violence shared that â45.1% of Black women experienced physical violence, sexual violence, or stalking from their intimate partner,â and â31.8% of Black women have experienced one or more of the following intimate partner violence-related impacts: being fearful, concerned for safety, any post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, injury, need for medical care, housing services, victim advocate services, and/or legal services, missed at least 1 day of work or school, and contacting a crisis hotline.â We cannot deny that domestic violence is a health crisis amongst Black women. The alleged abuses that both Cassie and Keke Palmer experienced tell the tale of manyâhow Black women will quietly endure abuse at the hands of those they are romantically involved with, for a plethora of reasons. While both Black men and women experience racism in America, itâs typically agreed upon that sexism is not as important. Feeling like they owe it to Black men to protect them from American prisons, Black women will sacrifice themselves and their health out of an obligation to their race. âOn average, Black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men, with Black women 1.4 times more likely to be killed than their white counterparts,â according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. A recent example of this was when Megan Thee Stallion came out about being shot by Tory Lanez. She initially told officials that she stepped on glass because her first mind was to protect herself and her shooter from the police. âI was lying to protect all of us [from the police]â she told Gayle King in an exclusive interview with CBS Mornings, âand sometimes I wish I would have never said that.â On the other side of Black women allowing their stories to be untold, is the ugly truth of victim blaming, something we also saw happen when Megan came forward. As people called her every name in the book and refused to believe her account of the events from that night, even after Lanez was found guilty by a jury for having shot her. When Black women speak up, there are always outsiders looking to poke holes in their stories. When news of Cassieâs lawsuit came to light, people questioned why she waited so long. Then when Diddy settled the suit the very next day, people criticized Cassie for only being after the moneyâdespite her having filed under the now-expired Adult Survivors Act in New York which allowed victims to sue their abusers even though the statute of limitations had passed. Other underlying factors that contribute to Black women not reporting their abuse or sometimes not leaving their situation include faith and finances. There are some spiritual beliefs where women are made to feel like they are required to stay with their partners through whatever, even abuse. Economic disparities also increase the risk factor of domestic violence in relationships. Weâre oftentimes labeled as âstrongâ or âangry.â And because of those images, itâs hard for society to visualize Black women as helpless, fragile, or victims; those stereotypes allow Black women to be three times more likely to die than their white counterparts as a result of domestic violence. But enough is enough. Malcolm X once said, âThe most disrespected person in America is the Black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black woman.â While this statement was made in 1962, it still rings true 61 years later. Itâs imperative that we utilize our voices and platforms to advocate for the protection of Black women.

In 2023 alone, FX aired a five-part docuseries on him, at least three different writers authored books about him, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a long-overdue arrest and indictment has finally been made in his murder investigation. I’ve thought a lot about Shakur, beginning in the 1990s when I was a teenage fan of his music and more recently during the four years I’ve spent researching, writing, and promoting my book, An Amerikan Family: The Shakurs and the Nation They Created. During this time, I’ve become increasingly convinced that the public continues to overlook Shakur’s greatest legacy: that of a messenger steeped in the Black prophetic tradition, blending spirituality and liberation theology with social justice advocacy—conveying principled messages meant to deliver Black people in this life and thereafter. To be sure, Tupac Shakur was an imperfect messenger. He was brash, profane, and often vulgar. He faced repeated arrest and incarceration for alleged assault and other offenses. He drank liquor, smoked blunts, and celebrated promiscuity. But Shakur at the same time was a harsh critic of police brutality, he advocated for women’s reproductive rights, and condemned wealth inequality in America. More than anything, he was deeply committed to his core demographic: young Black men. To Shakur, young Black men were lost sheep in the wilderness of North America—banished and besieged, feared and misunderstood—and he longed to be their redeemer, even if it meant offering his own life as a cautionary tale. If Shakur could be said to have a creed or doctrine, it would be the doctrine of Thug Life. Many people assumed he was promoting hooliganism, but, Shakur explained, Thug Life was an acronym for “The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody”—meaning the injustices children face at a young age have repercussions on society at large. Thug Life, to Shakur, was his way of reaching his folks where they were at, without judgment or reproach. “Young Black males out there identify with Thug Life because I’m not trying to clean them up,” he said. “I am, but I’m not saying come to me clean. I’m saying come as you are.” In 1962, over a decade before Shakur was born, the writer James Baldwin reflected on his brief stint as a child preacher at a Pentecostal church in Harlem. In his essay, “Letter from a Region in My Mind,” first published by the New Yorker and later reprinted in his landmark book, The Fire Next Time, Baldwin describes what he’d perceived as the hypocrisy, arrogance, and gospel of submissiveness endorsed by the Black Church, and the feeling that the church had abandoned the urgent needs of the people, encouraging them “to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.” He wondered why they couldn’t organize around something tangible, like “a rent strike,” and he asked: “Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?” Thirty years later, Shakur’s 1993 song, “I Wonda if Heaven’s Got a Ghetto,” has clear parallels to Baldwin’s essay. The song, a B-side to his anthemic single “Keep Ya Head Up,” contrasts the pie-in-the-sky promises of the church to the real-life ills facing his community: police brutality, poverty, drug addiction, and other ills. Unlike Baldwin, though, Shakur seems to be asking not if heaven will replicate the same segregated and deplorable conditions as America’s inner cities, but whether heaven will welcome with open arms all the subjugated people who suffered, struggled, and rebelled against their conditions. Early on in his career, Shakur realized that when the church fails to reach the people most in need, it’s the militants, hustlers, or entertainers who will fill that need, and he would embrace all three roles interchangeably. At the same time, Shakur didn’t shy away from rebuking the church for not doing enough to address his community’s needs. In a 1996 VIBE interview, he acts as an interrogator of the church and its function in society: “If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we’d be a’ight,” Shakur says. “Have you seen one of these goddamn churches lately? It’s ones that take up the whole block in New York. It’s homeless people out here. Why ain’t God lettin’ them stay there? Why these n****s got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?” Consciously or not, Shakur’s demands for the church and society at large to pay attention to the unmet needs of Black Americans links him directly to the Black prophetic tradition, exemplified not only by Baldwin, but also Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and many others. The Black prophetic tradition, with roots that date back to the arrival of enslaved Africans to the American colonies, is a rhetorical tradition, rooted in (but not confined by) the Black Church, bearing witness to injustice, speaking truth to power, and boldly condemning White supremacy. The role of the prophet—from the days of Jonah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Hosea, and Daniel, to today—is not to mollify but to rebuke a nation that has deviated from principles of justice and righteousness. Black prophetic fire is a forewarning of grim and dire consequences, both for America and the world, if Black and other marginalized people continue to be persecuted. As the theologian James H. Cone writes in his 1970 book, A Black Theology of Liberation, “The black prophet is a rebel with a cause, the cause of over twenty-five million black Americans and all oppressed persons everywhere.” This, to me, defines Tupac Shakur. In the many hours I’ve spent reexamining his music and listening closely to his words, I’ve come to appreciate him beyond his reputation as a brash and hotheaded young nihilist. The recent influx of products, programs, and conversations related to Shakur proves I’m not alone in this reconsideration and recognition. Shakur was a bearer of difficult truths, a fiery and zealous critic of injustice, and a fierce advocate for the liberation and deliverance of the downtrodden. These are the responsibilities of the prophet. The prophet’s role is not to power over the people but to empower people to better themselves and envision a better world. “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world,” Shakur said, “but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” Nearly three decades after his death, Shakur’s millions of listeners across the world—young fans and oldheads like myself—continue to parse Shakur’s words, as though conducting biblical exegesis, seeking meaning and inspiration in his lyrics and interviews. As Black American men are killed by police officers at a staggering rate, as the gulf between rich and poor grows wider, and as drug addiction and overdose deaths continue to disproportionately affect communities of color, Shakur’s words remain as relevant and important—indeed as prophetic—as ever before.

(KABC) -- Officers shot and killed a woman who was pointing a gun at a toddler inside a San Bernardino home, police officials said. San Bernardino police say the suspect, Darvet Brown, 35, was pointing a gun at a 3-year-old inside the apartment on East 21st Street when officers confronted and ultimately shot her several times. She was later pronounced dead at the scene. The incident unfolded Sunday around 8 a.m. when police were called to the home by a grandmother who said a woman was inside the apartment threatening the caller's 3-year-old grandson. When officers showed up, the grandmother said she feared for her grandson's life as the woman had already fired the gun inside the residence. Officers say as they were talking to the grandmother, they saw the suspect come out on the balcony and point a gun at them before running back inside and locking the door. Officers kicked open the door and say they saw the woman standing on a bed pointing a gun at the child who was seated below her. Fearing for the boy's life, they shot the woman, wounding her. They say she refused to drop the gun and they fired again, then ran in to pull the boy to safety. Brown was declared dead at the scene. She was not related to the child and her motive remains under investigation. The child was not injured. Police released a still image from bodycam video that shows the woman standing on the bed with a gun in her hand. A law enforcement expert said this is the type of split-second, life-or-death decision that officers can face on the job. ""This is the kind of incident that ultimately results in an OIS - officer-involved shooting - that sticks with you your entire career and beyond,"" said Bruce Thomas, a retired investigator with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ""You don't really know what's going on, but you've been told, you hear, and once you kick in the door and go in - that first officer who engages the suspect, that is just heroic, beyond heroic."""

Little Rock Police Department Chief Heath Helton provided the details during a news conference at department headquarters. Officers responded to a shots fired call at a Days Inn, 8219 I-30, just after 3 p.m., Helton said. A caller told police that as many as five shots were fired and that a male suspect in the gunfire left in a vehicle. The caller also reported seeing another potential suspect with a handgun, around the back of the hotel, according to the chief. Another caller told police they saw the suspect shoot into a hotel room, which was later determined to be room 110, though police said they didn't find anybody injured as a result of that gunfire. When officers arrived at the scene they found a male suspect matching the description of the suspect in possession of a gun outside the east side of the Rest Inn, 8217 I-30, according to Helton. Police said they approached the suspect and instructed him to comply with them, though he refused. He reached into his waistband for a handgun. Two officers shot their service weapons, critically injuring the suspect. He was taken to an area hospital, where he later died. Both officers were placed on administrative leave, and the investigation into the shooting and shots fired call remain active, according to police. The officers each had roughly four years' experience within the department, the chief said. Helton described Monday's events as a ""tragic incident."" ""These types of incidents are tough on the victims as well as the officers involved,"" he said. Police didn't immediately release the names of the suspect or the officers who shot him, though Helton said he expects to release the suspect's name within the next day."

St. Paul police released the video five days after the encounter Thursday at Cretin and Marshall avenues that resulted in the death of 24-year-old Brandon Daleshaun Keys, of Maplewood. Officer Michael Tschida was wounded after Keys fired within moments of Tschida's arrival at the scene, striking the officer in the leg before Tschida shot Keys. Keys died the following morning at Regions Hospital. Tschida, a 14-year law enforcement veteran, was treated and released. He was placed on administrative leave â a standard practice for officers involved in use-of-force investigations by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). ""In one moment we experienced an officer who was injured by gunfire in our community, and in that same moment we experienced an officer-involved shooting,"" Mayor Melvin Carter said. ""Trust cannot be built, cannot be established, cannot be done in the dark. Which is why transparency is such a core function."" According to the BCA, the encounter unfolded just after 2 p.m., when a woman called 911 to report that a man she knows was violating a court order for protection against him. She said the man had a gun and was hitting her vehicle with his as she drove through St. Paul with a male passenger. Transcript from the woman's 911 call suggest that Keys rammed the van she was driving with his blue Impala sedan and broke her van's windows. She told the dispatcher he was armed. ""â¦ Oh, my god, he hit me again. Oh, he's gonna â¦ kill me,"" transcript of the woman's call read. The footage showed how the shooting unfolded as soon as Tschida arrived at the scene, exited the squad and ordered Keys to the ground. Keys ducked behind a vehicle and shot at Tschida, who then returned fire. Keys, who was struck, then dropped to the ground behind the vehicle. ""Shots fired,"" Tschida repeats over his police radio, taking cover behind his squad. ""I'm hit."" The woman in question then parked her van and exited, screaming and running to Keys, who was on his back on the pavement. ""Tell 'em don't shoot, don't shoot, please,"" the woman told 911, according to call transcripts. ""He's down. No, he don't have a gun. No please. Send an ambulance, please."" Tschida then yelled at the woman to step away from Keys, who cannot be seen from behind the vehicle. Bystanders also urged the woman to step away from Keys as Tschida limped toward him, picked up the gun where it lay near his feet and moved it away. The footage then ended as multiple squads arrive to the scene. ""The events that transpired on [that day] will have a lasting effect in our community, particularly to our first responders, particularly to our officers, paramedics dispatchers and our professional staff,"" Police Chief Axel Henry said. ""Healing is a process that takes time, patience and support. But we stand here as one community and we will do everything we can to support one another while the BCA completes this investigation."" Keys was due in Hennepin County District Court this week for a hearing in connection with a two-year order for protection secured in October by a 38-year-old woman who shares a 5-year-old child with him, according to court records. It's unclear whether she is the same woman involved in Thursday's incident. She also had an order for protection taken out in 2018, when she alleged that Keys gave her a black eye and bruises. ""[He] has a history of beating me physically,"" she wrote. Keys has been convicted twice for misdemeanor domestic abuse, both times for violating an order for protection involving the same woman, court records show. Tschida was one of four St. Paul police officers who fired their weapons in the killing of Jaffort Demont Smith on May 9, 2016. Smith ignored orders to drop his weapon after he had shot and wounded a 49-year-old woman with him who eventually lost an eye. A grand jury ultimately issued no charges against the officers involved. Last year, Smith's family sued the officers and the city of St. Paul in federal court, alleging Smith's civil rights were violated. According to a Star Tribune database, at least 230 people have been killed in Minnesota during encounters with law enforcement. Star Tribune staff writers Louis Krauss, Paul Walsh and Katie Galioto contributed to this report."

When officers kicked down the door of one the apartment’s bedrooms, they came face-to-face with the woman who was standing on a bed pointing a handgun at the boy who was seated next to her, according to police and photos released from the scene. One officer then fired shots at the woman, according to San Bernardino Police Lt. Jennifer Kohrell. The woman kept the gun in her hand and, after the officer ordered her to drop it, pointed the firearm back at the child. The officer shot her again before additional police rushed in to get the child away from harm, Kohrell said. Officers were unable to negotiate with the woman as the child’s life was in “imminent danger,” Kohrell said. “The gun was pointed directly at the child’s head, and we couldn’t spend too much time negotiating and risk the safety of the child,” Kohrell said. “The actions of the officer saved the child’s life.” The woman, Darvet Brown, of San Bernardino, was pronounced dead at the scene. Brown was friends with the woman living in the apartment and was staying there at the time, Kohrell said. She was not related to the child and information on a motive for her behavior was not available on Monday. The child was not injured and was returned to family members outside the apartment, police said. The incident first began around 8 a.m. Sunday when a 911 caller reported that an armed woman inside her apartment in the 200 block of East 21st Street was holding a gun to the head of her 3-year-old grandson, according Kohrell. The woman had moved onto the balcony when police arrived and pointed a gun at one of the officers. The woman then went back inside the apartment and locked the door with the child still inside. The 911 caller told officers the woman had already fired the gun inside the apartment, Kohrell said. That’s when officers entered the apartment and proceeded to kick down the bedroom door leading to the confrontation. Anyone with information regarding this incident should contact San Bernardino Police Detective Chavez at Chavez_ed@sbcity.org."

In 2023 alone, FX aired a five-part docuseries on him, at least three different writers authored books about him, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a long-overdue arrest and indictment has finally been made in his murder investigation. I’ve thought a lot about Shakur, beginning in the 1990s when I was a teenage fan of his music and more recently during the four years I’ve spent researching, writing, and promoting my book, An Amerikan Family: The Shakurs and the Nation They Created. During this time, I’ve become increasingly convinced that the public continues to overlook Shakur’s greatest legacy: that of a messenger steeped in the Black prophetic tradition, blending spirituality and liberation theology with social justice advocacy—conveying principled messages meant to deliver Black people in this life and thereafter. To be sure, Tupac Shakur was an imperfect messenger. He was brash, profane, and often vulgar. He faced repeated arrest and incarceration for alleged assault and other offenses. He drank liquor, smoked blunts, and celebrated promiscuity. But Shakur at the same time was a harsh critic of police brutality, he advocated for women’s reproductive rights, and condemned wealth inequality in America. More than anything, he was deeply committed to his core demographic: young Black men. To Shakur, young Black men were lost sheep in the wilderness of North America—banished and besieged, feared and misunderstood—and he longed to be their redeemer, even if it meant offering his own life as a cautionary tale. If Shakur could be said to have a creed or doctrine, it would be the doctrine of Thug Life. Many people assumed he was promoting hooliganism, but, Shakur explained, Thug Life was an acronym for “The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody”—meaning the injustices children face at a young age have repercussions on society at large. Thug Life, to Shakur, was his way of reaching his folks where they were at, without judgment or reproach. “Young Black males out there identify with Thug Life because I’m not trying to clean them up,” he said. “I am, but I’m not saying come to me clean. I’m saying come as you are.” In 1962, over a decade before Shakur was born, the writer James Baldwin reflected on his brief stint as a child preacher at a Pentecostal church in Harlem. In his essay, “Letter from a Region in My Mind,” first published by the New Yorker and later reprinted in his landmark book, The Fire Next Time, Baldwin describes what he’d perceived as the hypocrisy, arrogance, and gospel of submissiveness endorsed by the Black Church, and the feeling that the church had abandoned the urgent needs of the people, encouraging them “to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.” He wondered why they couldn’t organize around something tangible, like “a rent strike,” and he asked: “Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?” Thirty years later, Shakur’s 1993 song, “I Wonda if Heaven’s Got a Ghetto,” has clear parallels to Baldwin’s essay. The song, a B-side to his anthemic single “Keep Ya Head Up,” contrasts the pie-in-the-sky promises of the church to the real-life ills facing his community: police brutality, poverty, drug addiction, and other ills. Unlike Baldwin, though, Shakur seems to be asking not if heaven will replicate the same segregated and deplorable conditions as America’s inner cities, but whether heaven will welcome with open arms all the subjugated people who suffered, struggled, and rebelled against their conditions. Early on in his career, Shakur realized that when the church fails to reach the people most in need, it’s the militants, hustlers, or entertainers who will fill that need, and he would embrace all three roles interchangeably. At the same time, Shakur didn’t shy away from rebuking the church for not doing enough to address his community’s needs. In a 1996 VIBE interview, he acts as an interrogator of the church and its function in society: “If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we’d be a’ight,” Shakur says. “Have you seen one of these goddamn churches lately? It’s ones that take up the whole block in New York. It’s homeless people out here. Why ain’t God lettin’ them stay there? Why these n****s got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?” Consciously or not, Shakur’s demands for the church and society at large to pay attention to the unmet needs of Black Americans links him directly to the Black prophetic tradition, exemplified not only by Baldwin, but also Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and many others. The Black prophetic tradition, with roots that date back to the arrival of enslaved Africans to the American colonies, is a rhetorical tradition, rooted in (but not confined by) the Black Church, bearing witness to injustice, speaking truth to power, and boldly condemning White supremacy. The role of the prophet—from the days of Jonah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Hosea, and Daniel, to today—is not to mollify but to rebuke a nation that has deviated from principles of justice and righteousness. Black prophetic fire is a forewarning of grim and dire consequences, both for America and the world, if Black and other marginalized people continue to be persecuted. As the theologian James H. Cone writes in his 1970 book, A Black Theology of Liberation, “The black prophet is a rebel with a cause, the cause of over twenty-five million black Americans and all oppressed persons everywhere.” This, to me, defines Tupac Shakur. In the many hours I’ve spent reexamining his music and listening closely to his words, I’ve come to appreciate him beyond his reputation as a brash and hotheaded young nihilist. The recent influx of products, programs, and conversations related to Shakur proves I’m not alone in this reconsideration and recognition. Shakur was a bearer of difficult truths, a fiery and zealous critic of injustice, and a fierce advocate for the liberation and deliverance of the downtrodden. These are the responsibilities of the prophet. The prophet’s role is not to power over the people but to empower people to better themselves and envision a better world. “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world,” Shakur said, “but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” Nearly three decades after his death, Shakur’s millions of listeners across the world—young fans and oldheads like myself—continue to parse Shakur’s words, as though conducting biblical exegesis, seeking meaning and inspiration in his lyrics and interviews. As Black American men are killed by police officers at a staggering rate, as the gulf between rich and poor grows wider, and as drug addiction and overdose deaths continue to disproportionately affect communities of color, Shakur’s words remain as relevant and important—indeed as prophetic—as ever before.

This time, the jurisdiction has changed. The Universal City Police Department say Eric Cantu Jr, 18, was arrested Saturday after an attempted traffic stop. But instead of pulling over, police say Cantu led one patrol car on a chase on Loop 1604 that ended in a parking lot. UCPD says while the chase was still on, Cantu’s BMW sideswiped another car. Cantu was arrested and charged with evading arrest and leaving the scene of an accident. KSAT-12 reports this is Cantu’s third arrest since he was shot numerous times in a McDonald’s parking lot. On that evening, an officer walked up to Cantu’s car as it was parked while he and his girlfriend were eating inside. The officer recognized Cantu’s vehicle after having chased it the night before, but SAPD called off the chase. Cantu survived multiple gunshots from the officer after he refused to exit the car and tried to pull away. Since that time, Cantu has additional arrests for evading police on another occasion and for shoplifting."

Officer Michael Tschida was shot and wounded in his leg. The officer shot Brandon Daleshaun Keys, 24, in the head and he died at the hospital early Friday. A 911 transcript, along with Tschida’s body-worn and squad dash cameras, show a woman’s desperate call for help and the intensity of the situation on a busy street in the city’s Merriam Park neighborhood. The woman called 911 Thursday afternoon and reported the father of her child was chasing her, that she had a current order for protection against him, and that he had a gun. “He just hit my car,” the woman reported, saying they were in separate vehicles. “… Oh my God. Please, I need help. … I’m trying to get away from him.” She reported he “just busted my windshield” and a male could be heard saying, “Open the door,” the 911 transcript shows. “I’m not calling the police,” the woman said and the man replied, “I just saw you.” “Brandon, I’m not,” the transcript continued. She reported she was in a silver van and he was in a blue Impala, and that the man was ramming her vehicle. “He’s gonna kill me,” she said. “God no, Brandon,” the woman could be heard saying on the call. “… No. You’re not going to jail. … Brandon, please go, leave.” The woman reported that police arrived and then she screamed, “No,” repeatedly and “Tell them stop. … Don’t shoot him,” before she asked for an ambulance to respond. Video shows officer limping, man on ground The videos show Tschida exited his squad at Cretin and Marshall avenues at 2:17 p.m. Thursday. He yelled to a man, “Get on the ground, on the ground!” That’s when the shooting happened. “Shots fired, shots fired!” Tschida relayed on his police radio. “… I’m hit!” A dispatcher called a “Signal 13,” the highest priority in St. Paul of an officer needing help. A woman ran from a silver van and to the man, and Tschida repeatedly shouted for her to move. “Get the (expletive) out of the way, so I can get him help!” Tschida yelled as she cried. The officer could be seen on video limping toward the pair, removing a handgun that was under the man’s ankle and moving it away. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating, has said they recovered a handgun at the scene. Tschida was treated and released from the hospital Thursday. He was placed on administrative leave, which is standard in such cases. Leaders respond Mayor Melvin Carter said Tuesday that St. Paul had “experienced, in one moment, two of the most horrific experiences that a community can endure.” “Both of those together are a challenging incident that leaves our city with complex layers of grief to unpack and to process,” Carter said. “We are fortunate and grateful that in this instance the injuries to Officer Tschida were non-life threatening. Our prayers, of course continue to be with him and with his family as he recovers. … We also know that we lost a community member at the same time. … We also know that that reality is traumatizing.” Carter said, in the interest of transparency, he’s committed to releasing body-camera footage after the BCA collects preliminary witness statements and the family of the deceased is able to view it. They hope the video provides “at least some clarity around some of the facts that we know very early on,” said Police Chief Axel Henry. Mark Ross, St. Paul Police Federation president, said the video shows Tschida responded “heroically” after he was shot and had no place to take cover. “This, once again, illustrates the grave danger posed to law enforcement, communities, and the decisions that must be made, in a split second, to preserve life,” said Brian Peters, Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association executive director, in a Tuesday statement. “This incident could have ended differently: the victim of domestic abuse could have died and/or the law enforcement officers or other innocent victims could have died. Enough is enough. It’s time for our leaders to stand together to denounce violent escalation on police.”"

The woman, identified as Darvet Brown, 35, and as not related to the child, forced herself into the apartment in the 200 block of East 21st Street around 8 a.m., the San Bernardino Police Department said. The childâ€™s grandmother called 911 and said a woman was in her apartment and holding a gun to her grandsonâ€™s head, police said. During the call, the grandmother said the woman had fired one round inside the apartment and said she was afraid for the childâ€™s safety, according to police. Father suspected of killing two of his four children had violent history, court records show Before his arrest, Prospero Serna had a string of custody battles, domestic violence restraining orders, and criminal cases â€” including a conviction for causing a fire to a structure or forest. Officers arrived at the apartment and found Brown on a balcony and pointing the gun at the grandmother, police said. Brown, appearing distraught, also pointed the gun at police, authorities said. Brown went back into the apartment and locked the door, police said. Officers knocked down the door and found Brown standing on a bed in the living room and pointing the gun at a crying boy who was seated next to her, according to police and a screenshot from an officerâ€™s body camera. San Bernardino police released the screenshot that shows Brown pointing a gun at the child while an officer points a weapon at Brown. Police have not released any video footage from the incident. A boy was killed last month when the gun he and another juvenile were handling unintentionally discharged, L.A. County sheriffâ€™s investigators concluded. An officer fired at Brown and struck her, but she continued to hold the gun and refused to drop it, police said. The officer shot at her again after she pointed the gun at the child a second time, according to police. Officers removed the unharmed child from the apartment before providing Brown with first aid, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Itâ€™s unclear what led up to the shooting or the circumstances surrounding Brownâ€™s behavior.

In 2023 alone, FX aired a five-part docuseries on him, at least three different writers authored books about him, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a long-overdue arrest and indictment has finally been made in his murder investigation. I’ve thought a lot about Shakur, beginning in the 1990s when I was a teenage fan of his music and more recently during the four years I’ve spent researching, writing, and promoting my book, An Amerikan Family: The Shakurs and the Nation They Created. During this time, I’ve become increasingly convinced that the public continues to overlook Shakur’s greatest legacy: that of a messenger steeped in the Black prophetic tradition, blending spirituality and liberation theology with social justice advocacy—conveying principled messages meant to deliver Black people in this life and thereafter. To be sure, Tupac Shakur was an imperfect messenger. He was brash, profane, and often vulgar. He faced repeated arrest and incarceration for alleged assault and other offenses. He drank liquor, smoked blunts, and celebrated promiscuity. But Shakur at the same time was a harsh critic of police brutality, he advocated for women’s reproductive rights, and condemned wealth inequality in America. More than anything, he was deeply committed to his core demographic: young Black men. To Shakur, young Black men were lost sheep in the wilderness of North America—banished and besieged, feared and misunderstood—and he longed to be their redeemer, even if it meant offering his own life as a cautionary tale. If Shakur could be said to have a creed or doctrine, it would be the doctrine of Thug Life. Many people assumed he was promoting hooliganism, but, Shakur explained, Thug Life was an acronym for “The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody”—meaning the injustices children face at a young age have repercussions on society at large. Thug Life, to Shakur, was his way of reaching his folks where they were at, without judgment or reproach. “Young Black males out there identify with Thug Life because I’m not trying to clean them up,” he said. “I am, but I’m not saying come to me clean. I’m saying come as you are.” In 1962, over a decade before Shakur was born, the writer James Baldwin reflected on his brief stint as a child preacher at a Pentecostal church in Harlem. In his essay, “Letter from a Region in My Mind,” first published by the New Yorker and later reprinted in his landmark book, The Fire Next Time, Baldwin describes what he’d perceived as the hypocrisy, arrogance, and gospel of submissiveness endorsed by the Black Church, and the feeling that the church had abandoned the urgent needs of the people, encouraging them “to reconcile themselves to their misery on earth in order to gain the crown of eternal life.” He wondered why they couldn’t organize around something tangible, like “a rent strike,” and he asked: “Was Heaven, then, to be merely another ghetto?” Thirty years later, Shakur’s 1993 song, “I Wonda if Heaven’s Got a Ghetto,” has clear parallels to Baldwin’s essay. The song, a B-side to his anthemic single “Keep Ya Head Up,” contrasts the pie-in-the-sky promises of the church to the real-life ills facing his community: police brutality, poverty, drug addiction, and other ills. Unlike Baldwin, though, Shakur seems to be asking not if heaven will replicate the same segregated and deplorable conditions as America’s inner cities, but whether heaven will welcome with open arms all the subjugated people who suffered, struggled, and rebelled against their conditions. Early on in his career, Shakur realized that when the church fails to reach the people most in need, it’s the militants, hustlers, or entertainers who will fill that need, and he would embrace all three roles interchangeably. At the same time, Shakur didn’t shy away from rebuking the church for not doing enough to address his community’s needs. In a 1996 VIBE interview, he acts as an interrogator of the church and its function in society: “If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we’d be a’ight,” Shakur says. “Have you seen one of these goddamn churches lately? It’s ones that take up the whole block in New York. It’s homeless people out here. Why ain’t God lettin’ them stay there? Why these n****s got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me?” Consciously or not, Shakur’s demands for the church and society at large to pay attention to the unmet needs of Black Americans links him directly to the Black prophetic tradition, exemplified not only by Baldwin, but also Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, and many others. The Black prophetic tradition, with roots that date back to the arrival of enslaved Africans to the American colonies, is a rhetorical tradition, rooted in (but not confined by) the Black Church, bearing witness to injustice, speaking truth to power, and boldly condemning White supremacy. The role of the prophet—from the days of Jonah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Hosea, and Daniel, to today—is not to mollify but to rebuke a nation that has deviated from principles of justice and righteousness. Black prophetic fire is a forewarning of grim and dire consequences, both for America and the world, if Black and other marginalized people continue to be persecuted. As the theologian James H. Cone writes in his 1970 book, A Black Theology of Liberation, “The black prophet is a rebel with a cause, the cause of over twenty-five million black Americans and all oppressed persons everywhere.” This, to me, defines Tupac Shakur. In the many hours I’ve spent reexamining his music and listening closely to his words, I’ve come to appreciate him beyond his reputation as a brash and hotheaded young nihilist. The recent influx of products, programs, and conversations related to Shakur proves I’m not alone in this reconsideration and recognition. Shakur was a bearer of difficult truths, a fiery and zealous critic of injustice, and a fierce advocate for the liberation and deliverance of the downtrodden. These are the responsibilities of the prophet. The prophet’s role is not to power over the people but to empower people to better themselves and envision a better world. “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world,” Shakur said, “but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” Nearly three decades after his death, Shakur’s millions of listeners across the world—young fans and oldheads like myself—continue to parse Shakur’s words, as though conducting biblical exegesis, seeking meaning and inspiration in his lyrics and interviews. As Black American men are killed by police officers at a staggering rate, as the gulf between rich and poor grows wider, and as drug addiction and overdose deaths continue to disproportionately affect communities of color, Shakur’s words remain as relevant and important—indeed as prophetic—as ever before.

When officers kicked down the door of one the apartment’s bedrooms, they came face-to-face with the woman who was standing on a bed pointing a handgun at the boy who was seated next to her, according to police and photos released from the scene. One officer then fired shots at the woman, according to San Bernardino Police Lt. Jennifer Kohrell. The woman kept the gun in her hand and, after the officer ordered her to drop it, pointed the firearm back at the child. The officer shot her again before additional police rushed in to get the child away from harm, Kohrell said. Officers were unable to negotiate with the woman as the child’s life was in “imminent danger,” Kohrell said. “The gun was pointed directly at the child’s head, and we couldn’t spend too much time negotiating and risk the safety of the child,” Kohrell said. “The actions of the officer saved the child’s life.” The woman, Darvet Brown, of San Bernardino, was pronounced dead at the scene. Brown was friends with the woman living in the apartment and was staying there at the time, Kohrell said. She was not related to the child and information on a motive for her behavior was not available on Monday. The child was not injured and was returned to family members outside the apartment, police said. The incident first began around 8 a.m. Sunday when a 911 caller reported that an armed woman inside her apartment in the 200 block of East 21st Street was holding a gun to the head of her 3-year-old grandson, according Kohrell. The woman had moved onto the balcony when police arrived and pointed a gun at one of the officers. The woman then went back inside the apartment and locked the door with the child still inside. The 911 caller told officers the woman had already fired the gun inside the apartment, Kohrell said. That’s when officers entered the apartment and proceeded to kick down the bedroom door leading to the confrontation.

The most recent incident over the weekend led to a police pursuit and ultimately an officer-involved shooting. “It’s unwanted by the community and it’s a very dangerous activity,” said Lorenzo Lewis, IMPD’s Northwest District Commander. IMPD said that these kinds of street takeovers can include reckless driving, speeding, racing, spinning and donuts with sometimes hundreds of people at a time. These events typically take place on private property without any kind of authorization. This is not only illegal but can lead to significant damage and cleanup for property owners. “They are (happening) illegally,” Lewis said. “They don’t have permits. They don’t have the authorization to hold those events. They don’t have the proper licensing or permits to do that. They illegally block traffic and take over private property that they don’t have permission to be at.” As street takeovers continue to become more common, police are working with other agencies to increase their resources. “We’ve worked collaboratively with other agencies, state police in particular. I want the community to know this, that we have been effective, so don’t feel discouraged that we can’t do anything because we can and have,” Lewis said. Just this year, IMPD has responded to multiple incidents involving reckless driving and spinning, without getting into specifics, they say their new tactics are working. “In one particular incident in the summer where we worked with the state police and other agencies as well where we were able to make over 40 arrests and actually confiscate 80 stolen vehicles,” he said. Police say this activity tends to slow down during the colder months but that doesn’t mean it can’t still happen. That’s why they want to send this message. “You will be arrested. They need to know that. They are going to be held accountable,” Lewis said. The community can help combat this problem too. People living near this type of activity are asked to call the police immediately."

It requires that all such investigations be presented to a grand jury to determine if the evidence supports the return of an indictment against the officer or officers involved. The investigation is ongoing and no further information is being released at this time. Jersey Shore Online went to the scene on the morning of December 6 and found a KIA Optima with major damage.

People are also reading… The video consists primarily of slides summarizing the incident and came with the caveat: ""This incident is under investigation, and all statements in this briefing are based on the details we know at this point. As the investigation continues, more details may be revealed that change the understanding of this incident."" According to the information slides contained in the video, at about 5:30 p.m., the Corson County Sheriff's Office asked BIA Standing Rock law enforcement officers to help them locate a man who was making threats with a gun.Â The agencies coordinated to meet at the sheriff's office in Mcintosh. The sheriff's office informed BIA law enforcement the man had fired a shot in front of a home that afternoon and had a history of assaults against police officers.Â Law enforcement found the man driving a blue pickup truck in front of a rural residence just northwest of Bullhead. Law enforcement stopped the truck, and the man got out and waved the handgun before returning to the vehicle and driving away. Footage of that portion of the incident is not included in the video.Â While driving away, the truck reportedly crashed into a BIA officer's vehicle that appears to be completely stopped. The first dash camera clip shows that incident. The blue truck fishtailed along the shoulder on the wrong side of the road in a head-on direction of the BIA vehicle. The dash camera shows the truck descend into the ditch on the right-hand side of the BIA vehicle. There is a thump as the truck passes. The BIA vehicle then made a U-turn into the ditch, got back onto the road and joined the pursuit of the blue truck. The clip then ends.Â The next clip shows the incident in the parking lot of the Bullhead Community Center where the man was ultimately shot. It lasts about 50 seconds.Â The BIA vehicle pulled into the parking lot and the man â whose face is blurred â is seen walking away from the truck. The driver side door of the truck is open.Â The man held what appeared to be a gun in his right hand throughout the entire interaction. He walked in a straight line away from the truck, turned towards the dash camera, walked backwards for a few steps, turned away again and continued walking. He then made a loop away from the dash camera and walked an almost half-circle in the parking lot. At that point, an officer shouted, ""Drop that gun.""Â The man began to wave around his left hand, keeping his right hand with the apparent weapon down at his side. An officer then shouted, ""Get down.""Â He then walked backwards away from law enforcement towards the edge of the parking lot, and an officer shouts, ""Drop that gun."" As the man turned away, an officer shouted, ""Get on the ground."" The man kept walking. With his back turned to the camera, he was shot once. Two officers come into view of the camera, but their faces were blurred. According to the BIA, law enforcement rendered first aid and called emergency medical services. He was taken to a hospital in Bismarck. On July 6, he was taken into federal custody. Neither his name nor the name of the BIA officer have been released.Â Citing privacy purposes, some audio and images were concealed in the video, but the BIA stated the footage from the incident has not been edited aside from the privacy redactions.Â The release of the footage comes about a year after the Department of the Interior announced a series ofâ¯new law enforcement policies intended to advance transparent and accountable policing practicesâ¯as part of the implementation of President Bidenâs May 2022â¯Executive Orderâ¯on advancing effective, accountable policing and strengthening public safety. According to the BIA's Friday release, the bureau plans to consult with tribes on the development of a bureau policy consistent with the departmentâs policy and the presidentâs executive order. ""The BIA is committed to transparent policing and strengthening the publicâs trust in its law enforcement program,"" according to the statement.Â The FBI is still investigating the shooting, and the BIA Office of Justice Services Internal Affairs Division is conducting an administrative review of the incident. Neither agency has completed their investigation. Contact Shalom Baer Gee at sgee@rapidcityjournal.com"

(WFRV) – Two Wisconsin men are facing criminal charges after allegedly fleeing officers in a stolen vehicle, which led to an officer-involved shooting. On December 10, the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office issued formal charges against 22-year-old Kenneth D. Brown and 19-year-old Kenneth D. Rogers in connection to a shooting that happened on December 6 on the 400 block of North 29th Street and in connection to an officer-involved shooting on December 7, at North 51st Street and West Hampton Avenue. According to the Milwaukee Police Department, on Thursday, December 7, shortly after 3:15 a.m., officers observed a stolen vehicle wanted in connection to a shooting. They attempted to stop the car, but the suspects, Brown and Rogers, did not abide, and a pursuit ensued. Officers deployed stop sticks to stop Brown and Rogers, which were successful prior to the pair crashing. However, the two fled the vehicle on foot. Preliminary investigations reveal that Rogers was reportedly carrying a visible firearm and refused to drop the weapon despite multiple verbal commands from officers. Milwaukee Police says shortly before 3:30 a.m., multiple shots were fired in the 4800 block of North 51st Street. Both Rogers and Brown were transported to a nearby hospital, where Rogers was treated for critical injuries, and Brown was treated for minor injuries. The officers involved in the shooting were a 26-year-old man with eight years of service and a 27-year-old man with two years of service. Both officers have been placed on administrative duty, as is routine in an officer-involved shooting. Both were uninjured during the incident. Kenneth Brown is facing the following charges: - 1st-Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety - PTAC, as a Party to a Crime - Use of a Dangerous Weapon - Possess Firearm-Convicted of a Felony - Drive or Operate Vehicle w/o Consent - 2nd-Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety - Vehicle Operator Flee/Elude Officer - Resisting or Obstructing an Officer - Possess w/Intent-Cocaine (>15-40g) - PTAC, as a Party to a Crime - Posses w/Intent-Fentanyl (<=10g) - PTAC, as a Party to a Crime Kenneth Rogers is facing the following charges: - Possess Firearm-Adjudicated Deliquent of a Felony - Drive or Operate Vehicle w/o Consent - PTAC, as a Party to a Crime - Resisting or Obstructing an Officer - Possess w/Intent-Cocaine (>15-40g) - PTAC, as a Party to a Crime - Posses w/Intent-Fentanyl (<=10g) - Posses w/Intent-Fentanyl (<=10g) Court records show that Brown and Rogers are expected to have initial appearances in Milwaukee County Court on Monday. The pair could face over 50 years in prison and over $175,000 in fines each if convicted. The Milwaukee Police Department says that the Waukesha Police Department is leading the law enforcement investigation regarding the officer-involved shooting. Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact them at (262)-524-3831. No additional details were provided."

Law enforcement found the man inside Lucky Eagle Casino in Rochester. Officers contacted the man, and one officer shot him, the sheriff’s office said.

A referral authored by Supervisor Otto Lee, and scheduled for consideration by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, would create a direct phone line to reach the Trusted Response Urgent Support Team, or TRUST. The program dispatches four teams — for each quadrant of the county — consisting of a behavioral health professional, a medic and a community member with “lived” experience to provide peer support for someone who calls for help. Currently, someone who wants a response from TRUST has to call the 988 Suicide and Crisis lifeline and be triaged by a call taker, or in some cases, navigate a phone tree to access the program. Lee and supporters of establishing a direct line, led by the civil-rights group Silicon Valley De-Bug and families of people who have been killed by police while experiencing mental health crises, want to offer a more immediate connection and also get a clearer picture of how much the service is needed in the region. “This does not make 988 any less important. We’re happy with that service,” Lee said in an interview Monday. “This is for the caller who wants to know that there is no risk of having a uniformed response to a mental health crisis … The goal is that we hope more people will use TRUST more directly. We want people to seek help.” Debra Townley, a 54-year-old San Jose resident who says she has utilized public mental health services for more than three decades, says the prospect of directly contacting the service — and knowing there is no possibility of a triage assessment sending over a police officer — would be reassuring for those seeking psychiatric help before a situation becomes dangerous. “I’m a person with a mental disability, and when I’m emotionally hijacked, I need a direct line to help. I can’t navigate a phone tree. When that’s happening, you need direct access,” Townley said. “It seems really logical if we want to help people.” Jennifer Myhre, a senior organizer Showing Up for Racial Justice at Sacred Heart Community Service, said more and more, people are averse to calling 911 for a psychiatric emergency. “It doesn’t matter who we talk to, whether it’s a homeowner in Willow Glen or a working-class family in Gilroy, everyone sees the need and is longing for a non-police alternative to a mental health crisis,” Myhre said. She also cited a news investigation by the Bay Area News Group, KQED and the California Reporting Project published in October that examined a decade of use-of-force records from San Jose police and concluded that people who are mentally impaired — either by psychiatric illness or intoxication — accounted for nearly three-quarters of serious use of force incidents and 80 percent of police killings. The investigation also highlighted broad trends of police encountering people exhibiting erratic behavior, without threats of violence, ending up experiencing serious force and injury. “The investigative report that The Mercury News broke on the higher risk of injury and death of mentally ill and intoxicated people with police really underscored the stakes,” Myhre said. The report, Myhre added, gave the direct-line proposal a boost of political traction after it lost momentum over the past year. Lee said his referral, which if approved by the board would compel a report due Feb. 6 outlining how a direct TRUST line could be implemented, is not as experimental as it might appear. He pointed to similar arrangements in Oakland, Los Angeles County, Atlanta, Denver and Oregon. Advocates also pointed out that police intervention in psychiatric emergencies that involve threats of violence or safety concerns would remain an important response option, but that pushing programs like TRUST to the forefront would help ensure that it’s not utilized before it’s absolutely necessary. That aspiration is borne out in data cited by Lee’s office, recorded between November 2022 and this past August, showing that the program received 1,531 referrals from the Santa Clara County 988 line, second only to the Mobile Crisis Response Team, which pairs a clinician and police officer to respond to psychiatric emergencies. According to first-quarter 2023 data provided by TRUST, field teams were able to stabilize people in 72% of their dispatched calls without needing outside help. The program resolved more than 30% of their calls over the phone, and dispatched the field teams in 47% of calls. Lee said creating a direct line is important to getting a better gauge of how much demand there is for the program, and if it’s as robust as supporters expect, to resource it accordingly. “We won’t know until it’s implemented and we collect three to six months of data to find out how much more that need is, and then we can see what we need to allocate.”"

The child was not physically harmed during the incident, and no officers were injured. The San Bernardino P.D. gave this account of the incident: At about 8 a.m., officers responded to a call in the 200 block of East 21st Street of a subject armed with a handgun. According to a very distraught caller, there was a woman inside the residence with a gun to the head of her 3-year-old grandson. When officers arrived, the female suspect walked onto a balcony of the apartment and allegedly pointed a gun at one of the officers, who had just met the reporting party outside. The suspect retreated into the apartment where the young child was still located and locked the door. The reporting party was hysterical as she explained that the female suspect had already shot off the gun inside the residence and stated the baby was not safe with the suspect inside. Due to the suspect barricading herself with the child inside, the officers had to kick open the door. When the first officer kicked the door open, he saw the suspect standing on a bed inside the living room with a gun pointed directly at the young child, who was seated on the bed right below her. The child was crying and was in immediate danger of being shot at that moment. The officer fired several rounds at the suspect. The suspect was wounded, but she kept the gun in her hand. The officer ordered her to drop the firearm; however, she pointed her gun back at the child once more. The officer fired his weapon again to stop the suspect and attempt to save the childâs life. Officers immediately ran and grabbed the baby to get it away from harm. The child was not injured and was returned to family members outside the apartment. Medical aid was rendered to the suspect, but she succumbed to her injuries at the residence. The suspect was identified as Darvet Brown, a 35-year-old resident of San Bernardino. She was not related to the child, and the motive for her behavior is not fully understood at this time. This investigation is still ongoing. Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact Detective Chavez at Chavez_ed@sbcity.org."

It would go to the children of Michael Craig, 61, who was shot and killed by police in 2021 after Craig called 911, saying his wife had “a knife on me, on the bed, on my throat.” Chicago taxpayers will spend $8.75 million to compensate the family of a 61-year-old man who was shot to death by a Chicago police officer who responded to a call about a woman “threatening her husband with a knife.” The $8.75 million award to the adult son and minor child of Michael Craig was the largest of three settlements approved Monday by the City Council’s Finance Committee for a total of $11.26 million. The larger of the other two — for $2 million — was narrowly rejected by the City Council in July. It stems from a 2014 police shooting that killed Darius Cole-Garrit. Prior to that earlier 26-to-22 vote, Ald. Bill Conway (34th), a former assistant state’s attorney, noted that eight of the shots fired by officers who chased Cole-Garrit on foot were “in the front” of the victim’s body. That means he was facing the officers. Conway voted “no” again Monday. He has said the Independent Police Review Authority, the oversight body that preceded the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, had cleared the officers involved in the case. There is no bodycam video. The larger settlement involves Michael Craig, who was shot and killed by Chicago police officer Alberto Covarrubias on Oct. 4, 2021. Covarrubias, who remains on the force, was responding to the latest in a series of domestic violence calls at that same address. This time, Craig had personally called 911 to say his wife had “a knife on me, on the bed, on my throat.” “She’s got a knife on my neck, I can’t move. If I move she’s gonna kill me,” Craig is heard saying on audio of the 911 call released after the shooting. The victim is then heard telling his son: “Go downstairs so you can let the police in. Go. Do like I said, go downstairs.” When Covarrubias arrived at the Gresham apartment building in the 7700 block of South Carpenter, Craig’s 7-year-old son was indeed “standing outside the apartment building waiting for them,” Deputy Corporation Counsel Caroline Fronczak told alderpersons Monday. “That child indicated that his mother had the knife to his father’s throat,” Fronczak said. “When the medical examiner reviewed the injuries to Mr. Craig, there were multiple stab wounds on him that she characterized as defensive. … So all indications are that the woman was, in fact, threatening and actually stabbing the man with a knife.” Body-worn camera footage released by COPA showed Covarrubias walking up the stairs to the couple’s second floor apartment with a Taser in his right hand. From the stairwell outside the door, the officer announced, “Chicago police” and Craig was heard yelling back: “She got a butcher knife to my neck!” As the officer prepared to step through the door, Craig’s wife screamed and the officer drew his pistol, switching the Taser to his left hand. He fired the first shot almost immediately after crossing the threshold of the apartment door, as Craig and his wife appeared to struggle in a narrow hallway between the kitchen and bathroom. Craig and the woman fell to the floor, and the officer fired a second shot as Craig tried to sit up while the officer shouted, “Stop! Stop! Stop touching her.” The settlement, to be paid to Craig’s adult son Patrick Jenkins and a “minor son,” was approved by a unanimous voice vote. “The Department of Law believes the potential exposure in this case is reasonably high, given the 911 calls identifying that the female was the one that was threatening the husband with the knife,” Fronczak said. Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st) said there were “things that were shared” during closed-door aldermanic briefings on the case that “make me deeply angry.” La Spata did not elaborate, but he got Fronczak to acknowledge that the second shot was fired while Craig was on the ground. “I’m gonna let that sit … for a minute,” the alderperson said. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) added, “He knew the situation and went in shooting?” Fronczak noted that “only one officer actually saw” the struggle. “He believed the man was the aggressor toward the woman, but a post-shooting investigation indicates otherwise,” Fronczak said. COPA and CPD both recommended “discipline” for Covarrubias that is “currently under review in this case,” Fronczak said. The smallest of the three settlements — for $515,000 — went to a gay Chicago firefighter who went on extended leave after being harassed by a deputy chief who was subsequently disciplined for that behavior."

Troopers from Shenandoah and Mahanoy City boroughs were dispatched to the 300 block of West Coal Street at 12:38 a.m. after a report of a burglary that was taking place inside a vacant home, troopers said. The owner of the vacant home told police he called 911 after he looked at video surveillance inside the home and noticed a man inside the home wearing a mask and carrying a âlarge knife.â When troopers arrived at the scene, they met with the property owner, who gave them access to the home. During a search troopers found a man, later identified as Bryon Scheuring, 32, of Shenandoah, âhiding under a bed in an upstairs bedroom,â said PSP. Troopers said they asked Scheuring multiple times to surrender but he refused to comply, according to PSP. âAs [officers] began moving the bed to take him into custody, Scheuring lunged at officers while holding a machete. A Shenandoah officer fired one round from his pistol, striking Scheuring,â troopers said in a statement. Officers rendered aid and called EMS, but Scheuring died from his injuries, according to state police. Troopers said he was pronounced dead by the Schuylkill County Coronerâs office.

Sheriffâs officials said Curtis Harris was killed after he pulled a gun and shot at officers in the parking lot of a Ralphs grocery store, injuring a police sergeant. Someone called police about 10 p.m. to report a stolen vehicle and a prior domestic violence incident. Police said they received a suspect description and information that he was a felon and known to carry a firearm, said sheriffâs Lt. Joseph Jarjura. Sheriffâs officials are investigating the shooting under a countywide agreement that ensures no agency investigates its own police shootings. Police found the car about 11:30 p.m. at the 4S Commons Town Center on 4S Commons Drive near Rancho Bernardo Road. Jarjura said officers were trying to serve Harris with an emergency protection order when they approached him at the store. The victim in the protective order, which had been signed by a judge, lived near the shopping center, he said. It was unclear when the order had been issued or when the alleged prior domestic violence incident had occurred. Officers found the suspect inside of the store, and as police approached, he ran outside. Harris allegedly turned and fired multiple rounds at officers in the parking lot â striking a sergeant in the head. A round also struck a police vehicle, Jarjura said. Three officers fired at Harris, who was struck and fell to the ground. Police said a firearm was located near Harris, who was also carrying a loaded magazine. Officers rendered medical aid to the suspect and the sergeant, and both were transported by medics to separate hospitals. Harris was pronounced dead around 1 a.m. The sergeant, who has not been identified, was âstable,â police said Monday. He has been with the department around six years, police officials said. Names of the officers involved in the shooting also have not been released. Footage of the incident was recorded on body-worn cameras, officials said earlier. San Diego officers have faced more gun threats in 2023 than the previous two years combined, according to data maintained by the departmentâs homicide unit. Since January, two officers have been shot, five officers have been shot at and three officers have been threatened with firearms. And in August, a suspect fatally shot a 4-year-old police dog named Sir. The latest news, as soon as it breaks. Get our email alerts straight to your inbox.

Bryon David Scheuring, 32, was shot by a borough police officer who fired one round from his pistol when police moved a bed and Scheuring lunged at them while holding a machete, officials said. The officers had given “numerous verbal commands to Scheuring to surrender, which he failed to obey,” police wrote in a news release issued Monday afternoon. Shenandoah and Mahanoy City police responded at 12:38 a.m. to 309 W. Coal St. for a burglary in progress called in by the property owner, who through video surveillance saw a person inside the home wearing a mask and carrying a large knife, and called 911, police said. As police were clearing the residence they found Scheuring under a bed in an upstairs bedroom. After the shooting, officers rendered aid and contacted EMS, police said. Mayor Andrew Szczyglak, who said he arrived at the scene about 2 a.m., said Deputy Coroner Albert T. Barnes pronounced the man dead at the scene. “There has never been a fatal death involving a police officer in my time,” he said about his nearly 20 years as a council member or mayor in Shenandoah. Officer put on leave The mayor said two Shenandoah officers were in the room when the shooting took place but doesn’t know if any Mahanoy City police were present. State police are doing ballistics tests, Szczyglak said. He said the investigation is being conducted by state police because borough police were involved. The mayor said the full-time officer, who he declined to name, is on leave until the outcome of the investigation by state police. He wasn’t sure Monday afternoon if it would be paid leave. Borough police do not wear body cameras, Szczyglak said. Autopsy planned County Coroner Dr. David J. Moylan III said there will be a traditional forensic autopsy on Scheuring’s body at the Dauphin County Forensics Centers either Tuesday or Thursday. Moylan said he requested the traditional autopsy to be thorough considering the circumstances. He declined to provide details about the post-mortem scan he conducted Monday, referring all questions to state police. Trooper David Beohm, public information officer for Reading-based Troop L, first posted on X at 5:21 a.m. that state police were investigating an officer-involved shooting. District Attorney Michael A. O’Pake, who said he was notified about the incident at 1:30 a.m., anticipates the investigation will be turned over to his department mid- to late this week. District attorney offices typically investigate officer-involved shootings in Pennsylvania. Neighbors react Neighbors said they noticed ambulance sirens and later lots of police vehicles, but otherwise weren’t aware there was a shooting. Fred Koch, 71, who has lived with his wife, Rosemary, at 325 W. Coal St. since 1971, said he woke up at 1:30 a.m. and noticed the bright lights from an ambulance, but thought maybe a neighbor was ill. Marian Long, 64, and her husband, George, 67, who have live at 305 W. Coal St. for about 30 years, said they fell asleep on the first floor and woke up at 12:20 a.m. Shortly thereafter they noticed an ambulance. Marian Long also thought it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. Later in the morning, she saw a number of police vehicles, and said her husband talked to police. “It’s just shocking that it happened two doors down from where I live,” she said."

According to court documents, filed on Sunday in Marion County, Sebastian Jimenez has been preliminarily charged with one count of battery with a deadly weapon, one count of criminal recklessness and one count of reckless driving. Late Saturday evening, going into Sunday morning, IMPD officers were called to the 2800 block of Lafayette Rd., a location on the near northwest side of Indianapolis, on reports of reckless driving. When officers arrived, they saw numerous cars drifting around bystanders and vehicles that almost struck others in the lot. The documents said they also saw people hanging out of the windows of the cars while they were drifting. According to the documents, officers heard shots fired as they attempted to clear the lot. When the shots were reportedly fired, the IMPD officers vacated the lot. One of the officers identified a white Camaro being one of the reported vehicles that was reportedly driving erratically. Once officers initiated a traffic stop on the Camaro, officers reported that the vehicle fled northbound on Tibbs Ave. A vehicle pursuit between IMPD and the white Camaro continued northbound on Tibbs Ave. and passed West 30th Street into the parking lot of Cardinal Ritter High School. The documents said the parking lot was “a dead end” and IMPD officers blocked the exit. The documents said that the suspect in the Camaro, identified by police as Jimenez, rammed a police vehicle “so hard it caused significant damage and made (the) vehicle inoperable.” Officials said he nearly struck an officer, as well as another vehicle. According to previous reports, this is when an IMPD officer “engaged the vehicle (which led) to an officer-involved shooting.” Officials said at the time that no one was wounded by gunfire. The court documents filed on Sunday did not specify that an IMPD officer shot their weapon during the incident. Jimenez reportedly drove the Camaro out of the parking lot and drove to the nearby intersection where he struck a gray Kia sitting at the light. The documents said that Jimenez, as well as a female passenger, were transported to a nearby hospital with injuries. Jimenez was then placed under arrest on preliminary charges. According to court documents, Jimenez has a pending case in Spencer County on one count of auto theft, a Level 6 felony, as well as misdemeanor battery and reckless driving charges. Jimenez was out on bond when Sunday’s incident occurred. A hearing is scheduled in this case for Thursday."

The victim was found with a gunshot wound to the upper left thigh. Investigations reportedly revealed multiple bullet casings and fragments at the scene, and the victim's vehicle showed signs of gunfire. Surveillance video indicated that the suspects were in a black Honda. According to the criminal complaint from the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office, at around 3:17 a.m. on Dec. 7, a police pursuit involving the same Honda CRV began at N. 91st and W. Silver Spring. The chase, spanning over three miles, reportedly ended with the vehicle crashing near N. 51st Blvd. and the suspects fleeing on foot. The pursuit was captured on police body cameras and reportedly involved high speeds, wrong way driving and evasion of stop sticks. The complaint reports that shots were then fired, leading to critical injuries to Rogers and minor injuries to Brown. During the arrest, officers reportedly found a .45 caliber Glock pistol near where Rogers was arrested, and narcotics in the allegedly stolen Honda CRV. The complaint states that the drugs tested positive for cocaine and fentanyl, consistent with distribution quantities. Brown faces eight charges, including first-degree reckless endangerment using a dangerous weapon. This could lead to over 17 years in prison if convicted. He is also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years. Brown is also accused of stealing and operating a vehicle without the owner's consent, which could result in up to 3.5 years in prison. Another charge of second-degree reckless endangerment has a maximum sentence of 10 years. Fleeing from an officer could add another 3.5 years, while obstructing an officer has a smaller penalty of up to 9 months. For drug-related charges, Brown could face up to 25 years for intending to distribute cocaine and up to 15 years for the fentanyl charge. Rogers is facing a total of five charges, including possession of a firearm by an adjudicated delinquent, which has a maximum sentence of 10 years. Similar to Brown, Rogers is charged with stealing and operating a vehicle without consent, potentially leading to 3.5 years in prison. He could face up to 9 months for obstructing an officer. The drug charges against him, including intending to distribute cocaine, could lead to 25 years in prison, and the fentanyl charge has a maximum of 15 years."

Curtis Harris, a 46-year-old San Diego resident, was named by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department as the man shot by SDPD officers overnight Friday. According to SDSO, Harris had an unserved Emergency Protection Order against him tied to a prior domestic violence incident. Authorities were alerted to the incident after receiving a report of the protection order and a possible stolen vehicle around 10 p.m. Thursday. According to SDSO, a description of the suspect in the case was identified through officers’ initial investigation, including that he was a felon and known to carry a firearm. Around 11:30 p.m., officers were able to locate the stolen vehicle in the parking lot of a shopping plaza in the 10500 block of 4S Commons Drive. According to SDSO, the location was a short distance away from the residence of the victim in the protective order signed by a judge. Officers attempted to contact Harris, who was inside a Ralph’s grocery store in the center, in order to serve him the protection order. However, SDSO said he proceeded to run outside the store, firing multiple rounds at officers. One of the gunshots struck a sergeant with the SDPD SWAT team in the head, while another hit a SDPD vehicle. The sergeant was critically injured, but as of Monday, authorities said he remains in stable condition. Three officers returned Harris’ fire, striking him multiple times. According to SDSO, he then collapsed, dropping the loaded firearm on the ground near him. An additional magazine was also found on his body. Officers attempted to render medical aid to Harris and his partner. Both were transported to separate hospitals by paramedics. He was later pronounced dead by medical personnel at about 1 a.m. Friday. An autopsy of Harris conducted by the San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed the cause of death to be the gunshot wounds, with the manner of death ruled as a homicide. Per the countywide memorandum of understanding, SDSO’s Homicide Unit was called to the scene to conduct the investigation into the shooting involving the officers. SDPD is handling the investigation into the stolen vehicle. Once SDSO completes its investigation into the shooting, it will be reviewed by the San Diego County District Attorney to determine if the officers bear any state criminal liability for discharging their weapons. SDPD will also conduct an administrative investigation. The Commission on Police Practices will also review the incident and provide any appropriate recommendations. The names of all SDPD personnel involved in the shooting, including that of the injured sergeant, are being withheld by SDSO at this time. It is also not clear if the partner mentioned by authorities was the victim in the domestic violence case, or what the nature of their injuries were. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the Homicide Unit at 858-285-6330 or the after hours line at 858-565-5200. Those that would like to remain anonymous can do so by calling Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477."

Oakland man Joshua Gloria, 34, was shot and killed by Fremont officer Brian Burch on March 24, 2021 near Highway 84 and Ardenwood Boulevard. Police alleged that Gloria was driving a stolen car associated with an armed robbery and was also carrying a firearm. ""We believe that Fremont Police Officer Brian Burch 'had valid reasons to believe that Mr. Gloria represented a substantial risk of causing severe harm or even death to both himself and those in the vicinity and further that he reasonably believed that he needed to use deadly force to stop Mr. Gloria from fleeing,'"" reads a statement released by the district attorney's office. Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price in January announced that her office would be reviewing in-custody deaths and police shootings in her area, and she formed a Public Accountability Unit to do so, or PAU. Gloria's case was one of eight examined by her office. According to Price, so far, charges have been filed against two sheriff's deputies in the Vinetta Martin case, who took her own life at Santa Rita Jail in April 2021. At the time, there were accusations of inadequate cell checks and that guards had improperly cataloged cell checks. In May, deputies Sheri Baughman and Amanda Bracamontes were charged with falsifying records pertaining to Martin's suicide."

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said officers fatally shot the man in his 20s after he attempted to take hold of an officers weapon while resisting arrest. On Sunday afternoon, December 10, two San Antonio Park Police officers responded to a domestic disturbance call between a man and a woman at Elmendorf Lake Park on the near the Westside of San Antonio. When the first officer arrived, McManus says, the man involved in the dispute fled, hopping a fence into the backyard of a nearby house possibly because he had four outstanding warrants. McManus said the first officer attempted to tase the man twice, but the efforts were futile, and a struggle ensued between the officer and the man. “The struggle continued,” McManus said during a press conference near where the incident occurred in the 3400 block of Buena Vista Street near Our Lady of the Lake University. “The suspect was able to get his hand on the officer’s gun to try and take it from him. The officer cried out to his over officer, and the cover officer shot the suspect.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad More For You The man, who McManus said was in his late 20s, was pronounced dead at the scene. One of the responding officers had 14 years of experience on the force, says McManus, while the other had “considerably less years” of experience. The police chief said the man had four outstanding warrants for his arrest, including a warrant for previously attempting to take an officer’s weapon. “This morning our Park Police officer encountered a worst-case scenario and had to draw and use their weapon to defend a fellow officer in a life and death struggle with a criminal,” San Antonio Park Police Association President Henry Bassuk said in a statement. “A man, with several outstanding warrants, was shot and killed on site. Sadly, this is no longer a unique situation in San Antonio. Time and time again we see criminals with multiple warrants consistently committing crimes and endangering the lives of citizens and law enforcement. It’s well past time our city and county leaders, specifically District Attorney Joe Gonzales, step up and end this cycle of law breaking, bail, warrants, and more law breaking. Criminals belong in jail.” When asked if he found it frustrating that the man was out while wanted on four criminal charges, McManus said he’d yet to lookup the man’s background, but he said it “always remains a frustration.”"

This time, no one was wounded by gunfire. It was around midnight when several IMPD officers tried to clear a parking lot in the 2800 block of Lafayette Road, where several vehicles were driving recklessly and performing burn outs. ”While formulating a plan, at least one officer verbally informed dispatch that multiple shots were being fired in the area,” said Patrolman William Young. “They had already identified one vehicle for reckless driving, criminal recklessness. They engaged that vehicle, and it refused to stop for those officers and a short pursuit ensued that brought us here, where they rammed an occupied patrol vehicle, which in turn, the suspect took off and struck another vehicle.” Police said that, when the driver drove into a dead end parking lot near Cardinal Ritter High School, he pulled a U turn, and that’s where the police vehicle was rammed head-on with an officer inside and then took aim at two more officers. “A second officer engaged the vehicle leading to an officer involved shooting” said Young. “The vehicle continued to travel back southbound at a high rate of speed refusing to stop leading officers to West 30th street at Tibbs Avenue, striking another uninvolved vehicle at the intersection coming to a stop.” Officers took the 23-year-old driver into custody and called an ambulance for his female passenger. In an email sent Sunday evening, IMPD announced that Sebastian Jiminez was arrested for his alleged role in the incident. Jiminez has been preliminarily charged with battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness and reckless driving. ”Neither the suspect driver nor the passenger was shot by the officers,” said Young. Two officers were treated for minor crash injuries. At least twice in the past month, police say they have been targeted by drivers. Photos courtesy of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. George Leachman was shot by officers in Irvington last February when he rammed their vehicles. Out on bond and awaiting trial, Leachman was involved in another IMPD ramming incident on Indy’s south side in early November. Just before Thanksgiving, Antonio Berry was arrested after police say he smashed three of their vehicles at 75th and Shadeland one night as officers tried to arrest him for brandishing a gun outside of a bar and threatening to kill a bartender. This morning’s driver faces charges of Recklessness with a Deadly Weapon and Resisting with a Motor Vehicle. ”Absolutely, a truck can be considered a deadly force situation,” IMPD Lt. Shane Foley said after a previous incident. “We’ve seen earlier this year people have been killed with people using vehicles as weapons. We’ve seen earlier this year where people have used these weapons against our officers and it’s resulted in injury.” The driver from the Sunday morning incident is at the Adult Detention Center awaiting an initial hearing."

An arrest is merely an accusation, and he should be considered innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law. The Marion County Prosecutorâs Office will make the final charging decision.” INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Indianapolis police are investigating after an officer fired shots at a suspect early Sunday morning on the city’s near northwest side. At 12 a.m. Sunday, officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to the 2800 block of Lafayette Road on a report of multiple vehicles driving recklessly and spinning in the area. Spinning is a trend of utilizing a public park, a parking lot, a street, intersections or even an interstate to perform an action commonly referred to as a doughnut in a vehicle. Officers arrived on the scene to stop the reckless driving. At least one officer verbally reported to dispatch that he heard multiple gun shots fired in the area. Following the gun shots fired, officers witnessed a vehicle nearby that was driving recklessly and almost struck several people. Officers attempted to initiate a traffic stop for aggressive and erratic driving. The vehicle refused to stop for officers and a vehicle pursuit followed. Officers pursued the vehicle to a dead end in the 3000 block of Lincoln Road. The suspect vehicle then made a U-turn and rammed an IMPD vehicle head-on with an officer inside. Following that, a second officer was involved in an officer-involved shooting. However, neither the suspect driver nor the passenger was shot. The vehicle continued back southbound at a high rate of speed to W. 30th Street to Tibbs Avenue, striking another uninvolved vehicle at the intersection before coming to a stop. Officers then made contact with the suspect vehicle taking the driver and passenger into custody. The officers also rendered aid to the driver of the uninvolved vehicle until Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services (IEMS) arrived. The uninvolved driver was checked out by IEMS and released at the scene. The driver of the suspect vehicle and passenger were transported in stable condition to an area hospital with minor injuries. Two officers involved received minor injuries and were transported to an area hospital. Officers checked the nearby neighborhood and apartment complex and did not find additional injuries or property damage. The officer, who fired his firearm, has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in an officer-involved shooting investigation."

The department announced the update in a FridayÂ news release. Police conducted interviews and examined electronic devices as part of their month-long investigation, which did not identify any current employees of the department or its partner agencies as having engaged inÂ the unauthorized release of the images,Â the release says. Images of the 28-year-old shooterâs writings were released online by a conservative political commentator in November, eight months after the deadly attack at Covenant School. The shooter was killed by police at the scene. The leak of the images came amid an intense legal battle among groups who want evidence â including the shooterâs writings â released by authorities and parents of victims who said their release would cause further trauma. The images show hate-filled language directed toward the Covenant School and children and include what seems to be a timeline of events leading up to the shooting. The police department made attempts last month to interview a former detective who had images of the writings as part of his official duties, but he declined, according to the release. The department said it cannot âcompel statements or cooperation from former employees.â Police department employees previously placed on administrative leave pending the investigation have returned to their normal roles, the release added. Two detectives from the departmentâs Specialized Investigations Unit took photos of the writings immediately after finding journals in the Covenant School shooterâs vehicle to gather information about the shooter, the investigation found. One detective took two of the photos while the other took one, according to the release. The department will advance the investigation upon any new or undiscovered information, the release says. Steven Crowder, the American-Canadian conservative commentator who released the images, previously toldÂ CNN affiliate WSMVÂ that he did not regret sharing them online. Crowder, who has been accused of usingÂ homophobic and racist slursÂ in the past, said he released the pages for more transparency in the case. The March 27 massacre triggered an intense monthslong legal battle. Both gun rights advocates and news organizations have sought the release of the shooterâs writings, which might shed light on the motive for the attack â and could include the shooterâs journals and a suicide note. Those petitioning to have the writings released â including The Tennessean newspaper â say the documents are public records and that the First Amendment and the Tennessee Constitution grant public access to the records. Alternately, the National Police Association and the Tennessee Firearms Association, whoÂ are also suing for the records,Â have argued lessons gleaned from the writings could benefit public safety by shedding light on the killerâs thinking. But theÂ parents of two of the three childrenÂ who were killed have asked the court to deny Freedom of Information Act requests for the release of the shooterâs writings. The church that runs the school also sought to prevent the records from being released, alongside many parents of students who fear the release could inspire âcopycat attacks,âÂ CNN has previously reported.

Stephen Perkins, 39, was fatally shot on September 29 after officials said he “brandished a handgun” with a light “towards an officer with the Decatur Police Department,” according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. On Thursday (December 7), Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion announced that the city’s major decided to fire three officers and suspend one following a hearing that determined the officers violated policy. Decatur police were initially called to Perkins’ home after he allegedly pulled a handgun on a tow truck driver as he was attempting to repossess a vehicle at the 39-year-old’s home. Officers arrived at the scene with the tow truck driver, which is when Perkins “exited the residence armed with a handgun and began to threaten the tow truck driver,” according to police. “Officers on scene ordered the homeowner to drop his weapon, which he refused to do. It was at this time the homeowner turned the gun towards one of the Officers on scene. The Officer discharged his duty weapon, striking the subject,” Decatur police claimed. The police chief later said the officer didn’t order Perkins to drop a weapon. “We now know the officer identified themselves as ‘police’ and ordered Mr. Perkins to ‘get on the ground’ prior to the officer firing rather than ordering him to drop the weapon at that time as we initially reported the morning of the shooting,” Pinion said in a statement. “That means that we also erred in stating Mr. Perkins ‘refused’ to drop his firearm prior to the shooting. I apologize for the inaccurate description of the encounter in our initial statement.” Perkins’ family argued that the 39-year-old didn’t owe money on his car, citing that they had “found financial receipts proving” he wasn’t at risk of “being in an active status of repossession” and that “monthly payments were processed through his financing company.” “The Towing Company and City of Decatur Police Department wrongfully appeared at (his) home,” the family said in a statement. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is still investigating the incident independent of the probe completed by Decatur police. The Black Information Network is your source for Black News!

A French juvenile court on Friday convicted six teenagers for their roles in the beheading of a teacher by an Islamic extremist that shocked the country. Teacher Samuel Paty was killed outside his school in 2020 after showing his class cartoons of the prophet of Islam during a debate on free expression. The attacker, a young Chechen who had been radicalized, was killed by police. The court found five of the defendants, who were 14 and 15 at the time of the attack, guilty of staking out the teacher and identifying him for the attacker. Another defendant, 13 at the time, was found guilty of lying about the classroom debate in a comment that aggravated online anger against the teacher. EUROPE FACING ‘HUGE RISK OF TERROR ATTACKS’ DURING CHRISTMAS SEASON, EU WARNS The teenagers — all students at Paty’s school — testified that they didn’t know the teacher would be killed. All were handed brief or suspended prison terms, and required to stay in school or jobs during the duration of their suspended terms with regular medical checkups. They left the courtroom without speaking. Some had their heads down as they listened to the verdicts. One appeared to wipe tears. Paty’s name was disclosed on social media after a class debate on free expression during which he showed prophet caricatures published by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The publication had triggered a deadly extremist massacre in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom in 2015. Paty, a history and geography teacher, was killed on Oct. 16, 2020, near his school in a Paris suburb by attacker Abdoullakh Anzorov. The five who identified Paty to the attacker were convicted of involvement in a group preparing aggravated violence. SUSPECT IN ATTACK THAT KILLED TOURIST IN PARIS REPORTEDLY SHOUTED ‘ALLAHU AKBAR’ The sixth defendant wrongly claimed that Paty had asked Muslim students to raise their hands and leave the classroom before he showed the class the prophet cartoons. She was not in the classroom that day, and later told investigators she had lied. She was convicted of making false allegations. Her father shared the lie in an online video that called for mobilization against the teacher. He and a radical Islamic activist who helped disseminate virulent messages against Paty are among eight adults who will face a separate trial for adults suspected of involvement in the killing, expected late next year. The trial was held behind closed doors, and the media are not allowed to disclose the defendants’ identities according to French law regarding minors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The proceedings come weeks after a teacher was fatally stabbed and three other people injured in northern France in October in a school attack by a former student suspected of Islamic radicalization. That killing occurred in a context of global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and led French authorities to deploy 7,000 additional soldiers across the country to bolster security and vigilance."

Beginning in October 2023, Caltrans will be conducting a 12-mile-long freeway repaving project covering the entire Fremont segment from Ardenwood to Warm Springs. The project also includes safety improvements for pedestrian crossings at the various freeway interchange ramps. The entire project is expected to finish in 2025. Â Caltrans is undertaking the Capital Preventive Maintenance project to preserve and extend the life of pavement and improve ride quality for 90 lane miles on Interstate 880 in Alameda County. The work includes replacing asphalt surfacing, upgrading curb ramps to ADA standards, enhancing uncontrolled crossing locations with rectangular rapid flashing beacons, upgrading metal beam guardrails, replacing loop detectors, and modifying traffic systems and signs. Â The project will provide a smoother ride for motorists in Fremont and Newark, fixing potholes and deteriorated roadway and enhancing safety and mobility on the freeway. The work will be performed mainly at night to minimize the impact to motorists on this heavily traveled corridor. One or more lanes will be closed overnight from 8 pm to 5 am in northbound I-880 and 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. in southbound I-880 to accommodate the work. Both northbound and southbound I-880 will be repaved, with digout repair work beginning at spot locations along both directions of the freeway in Fremont and Newark in October 2023. Â The work will cover 11.8 miles in each direction from Fremont Boulevard south to the Alameda County/Santa Clara County line, for a total of 90 lane miles. It is the final piece of a major project that has been rehabilitating pavement on the I-880 corridor in Alameda County. Â Signage will be provided to alert motorists to the lane closures and California Highway Patrol will be onsite. One or more lanes will be closed to accommodate the work. Â Caltrans thanks the traveling public for your patience as we work to improve the bridges, highways and tunnels of the Bay Area. Â Construction Start: Fall 2023 Construction Finish: Fall 2025 Â Project Partners Caltrans, Bay Area Infrastructure Authority (BAIFA) and City of Fremont Â Progress to Date The project was awarded to Bay Cities Paving & Grading, Inc on July 13, 2023.

Â The agency will not register a disinfectant or sterilizer until it is determined to be effective and not posing an unreasonable risk to consumers when used according to the label directions. Products not registered with EPA can be harmful to human health, cause adverse effects, and may not be effective against the spread of germs. Â As part of the settlement, Grocery Outlet will pay a $392,000 penalty. Between October 24, 2020, and May 30, 2021 the company sold the unregistered products at its stores in Redwood City and Oakland and distributed them to independently operated Grocery Outlet stores, including in Stockton and Concord. Â âUnregistered products claiming to be disinfectants or sterilizers, like the kinds sold by Grocery Outlet in California, can defraud the public and threaten human health,â said EPA Pacific Southwest Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division Director Amy Miller. âThis settlement shows EPAâs continued commitment to enforcing laws that protect consumers from potential health risks and fraudulent claims.â Â The unregistered products are: - Love of Dream Antibacterial Wipes - Fabuloso Orange Energy Cleaner - Miami Sterilizing Antiseptic Wipes - Miami 75% Alcohol Wipes - Gold Essence Multi-Purpose Antibacterial Wet Wipes Â The wet wipes that Grocery Outlet sold and distributed claimed to sterilize or kill germs and bacteria on surfaces and the cleaning product claimed to be effective against bacteria such as E. coli. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, products that claim to kill or repel bacteria or germs, including disinfectants and sterilizers, are considered pesticides and must be registered with the EPA. The term âsterilizingâ is a claim attributed to pesticide products with the highest level of efficacy against microorganisms. Public health claims can only be made regarding products that have been properly tested and are registered with the EPA.

He will sing theater, film and pop. âCastro Valley Arts Foundation is very excited to bring an artist of this caliber to our stage,â said Vice President Mary Ann DeGrazia. Â In a telephone interview, Rutherford spoke about the challenges of playing the same role eight times a week, week after week. âI knew that half of my audience had seen the show before and the other half was attending Les Miserables for the first time. My goal was to meld this complex character with my personality. I always tried to dig deep to find the nuggets of truth in the script. And for those seeing the show multiple times, I tried to continue to grow with the character.â He remarked, âSome see Jean Valjean as saintly, but he struggles with his flaws in the anthem, âWho Am I?ââ¦Above all, an actor must be a good storyteller!â Â Rutherford joined Lea Salonga on Broadway in the 20th anniversary Les MisÃ©rables revival. He was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Valjean at the First Annual National Broadway Theatre Awards, held at the New York Supper Club in NYC. Rutherford has also starred in South Pacific, Titanic, and West Side Story. He played alongside Andrea McArdle at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Maine. Rutherford currently performs with orchestras worldwide as a concert soloist and cabaret artist. He lives in Irvine, California, and has a busy online teaching schedule when not touring.

LBP is second only to the common cold as a reason for a physician visit. Despite all the attention to LBP, a major contributor is often overlooked as a pain generator. Â According to Dr. Nic Gay, Orthopedic Surgeon at Silicon Valley Orthopedics, âup to 30% of low back symptoms are related to the Sacroiliac (SI) Joint. Yet, most physicians were never trained to consider the SI Joint when evaluating patients for back or hip pain.â Â The SI Joint forms the lowest segment of the spine and is located on either side of the sacrum in the low back and the pelvic areas. The SI Joint connects the sacrum, the triangular bone at the bottom of the spine, with the pelvic iliac crest. Â Strong ligaments encase each joint and allow for approximately two to four millimeters of movement during weight-bearing and forward flexion. When these ligaments become damagedâby normal wear and tear, or by injuryâthey may have excessive motion. This excessive motion may inflame and disrupt the joint and surrounding nerves. Â Sacroiliac joint pain can mimic discogenic or radicular low back pain, pelvic pain, or even hip pain. âThis could potentially lead to the wrong diagnosis and treatment,â says Dr. Gay. Â Common symptoms of SI joint dysfunction include: - Lower back pain (below L5) - Sensation in lower extremity; pain, numbness, tingling, weakness - Pelvis/buttock pain - Hip/groin pain - Leg instability (buckling, giving way) - Disturbed sleep patterns due to pain - Disturbed sitting patterns (unable to sit for long periods, sitting on one side) - Pain when going from sitting to standing Â Physicians can perform several diagnostic tests to determine if the SI Joint is contributing to symptoms. Tests may include provocative manipulation and injecting the SI joint with painkillers. Â Treatment may involve physical therapy and SI joint injections to manage the pain. âFor patients who are no longer responding to conservative care, the iFuse Implant System offers a minimally invasive surgical option,â states Dr. Gay. Â The iFuse procedure is a minimally invasive surgery that stabilizes and fuses the SI joint. Typically, a surgeon places three small triangular titanium implants across the joint, and the triangular shape and strength of the implant resists movement and rotation of the joint. Â If youâre interested in scheduling a consultation, call Silicon Valley Orthopedics at (510) 739-6520. To learn more about sacroiliac joint dysfunction and treatment options, join a free educational event on Wednesday, September 27 at 6 p.m. at Stonebrae Country Club, 202 Country Club Dr., Hayward.

Stratford Village Park features barbecue pits, picnic tables, and a half basketball court. Mature pines, elm and weeping willows surround several acres of healthy grass for sun or sports. Â The major attraction for this park is a mini skate park for novice skateboarders to sharpen their skills. There is a half-pipe made from two 4-foot berms; a 5-foot long 16-inch-high metal rail; and a small kick/flip ramp. Â The facility also boasts two playgrounds – one with a âjungle gymâ for grammar schoolers and toddlers, and another with equipment more appropriate for older children. The grounds are maintained by Hayward Area Recreation and Park District (H.A.R.D.). Â To get there, turn north from Industrial Parkway in Hayward, just east of I-880, onto Stratford Road. Stay on Stratford until you reach the park on your right, between Welford Lane and Canterbury Lane. Â Two blocks from the park you will find the neighborhood creek trail. The first street you pass on Stratford Road, to your left, is Pacheco Way. This street ends at the trailhead and there is always ample parking in this cul de sac. Â From the trailhead, an asphalt path for walking, biking or jogging extends along the elevated eastern shore of Alameda Creek for about a half mile. This ADA friendly trail that runs beside the creek from Pacheco Way to Folsom Avenue is excellent for brief exercise in a natural relaxing landscape. Â A manicured grassy slope between the foot path and the creek offers creekfront walking access. The grass route is popular for feeding the ducks. Several species of ducks and other birds, geese and an occasional blue heron frequent this stretch of waterway. I like to walk this trail in the mornings and often find myself surrounded by hundreds of assorted avians. Â Â Â A Clinicianâs Perspective on High Medical Costs in the United States Submitted by Darren Watt Â Background: Darren Watt, a senior at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, was able to interview Dr. Albert Woo, who has worked as both a healthcare provider and in healthcare informatics and software. (Dr. Woo prefers to keep his title and workplace private). Watt intends to major in Public and Global Health in college, and asked questions on this topic. Â From your time working in medical billing, what problems have you identified? Clinicians and hospitals get reimbursed by insurance companies or government payers after a service is provided. Thereâs a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done for medical billing to occur. Some procedures require prior authorization, which include a doctor submitting information to an insurance company to get approval. After the procedure is completed, the patient encounter turns into a claim submission by coders and billing specialists. The cost of the healthcare administrative overhead is around 30% of overall cost. There should be a more cost-effective way to determine whether the patient needs a treatment and send payment back to the service providers efficiently. Â How does insurance fraud contribute to high medical costs? The most common insurance frauds are billing for the same service multiple times, billing for more than what the patient received, or billing for services that werenât provided. In 2014, an oncologist was convicted of giving chemotherapy to his patients who did not need it. To answer your question, the unnecessary cost is absorbed and distributed to the healthcare system as a whole. The burden then falls on everyone. Â If these fraud cases occur, how do the government and law enforcement investigate and prosecute the offenders? Iâm not too familiar with the government and law enforcementâs processes. Insurance companies have internal audits to look for irregularities. There are times when whistleblowers can bring certain fraudulent practices into the light. Â From your time in the hospital, why do you think healthcare spending is on the rise? New drugs or procedures are being developed continually. Healthcare reimbursement historically is based on quantity. The more services a hospital provides, the more revenue it generates. Thereâs an inherent incentive to do more tests and procedures. Perhaps we need to place more emphasis on quality and outcome. Additionally, more healthcare services are needed as the population expands. Because of advancing treatment options, people live longer. Older patients also tend to have chronic illnesses requiring long term treatments and services. Â Are doctors providing unnecessary treatment or procedures? Patients in this country have reasonable access to healthcare. As physicians, weâre trained to do everything we can to help our patients regardless of cost. However, weâre not well trained in dealing with patients with terminal illnesses. Our approach is to do Â everything in our power to keep the patient alive. Sometimes that leads to wasteful spending such as providing treatment that does not consistently result in improvement of the patientâs outcome. Sometimes conservative measures can be more effective than aggressive measures such as expensive drugs and invasive procedures. Â Is labor shortage and physician burnout an issue? Itâs definitely a problem for the healthcare industry. Labor shortage increases the workload for many healthcare providers. That leads to burnout, leading to more people leaving the industry. Tired clinicians can cause more medical errors, which isnât good for patients. Labor shortage also has an impact on hospitalsâ finances as they would need to pay more to retain existing staff. The country needs more doctors and nurses to meet healthcare demands so the existing staff is not overworked. Â What do you think is the best way to lower healthcare spending? Like any other industry, we need to be more innovative and value conscious. Technology is a big part of the solution. Developing systems that diagnose diseases accurately leads to delivering the correct treatment sooner. Outcome research can also benefit the healthcare industry. The more we learn about how we achieve better outcomes, the quicker we identify the most effective treatments. Decreasing errors in healthcare also helps improve quality and lower costs. Â Conclusion: The US healthcare system spends over $4 trillion a year on healthcare. Healthcare spending totals 18.3% of GDP in the US, the highest in the world. Healthcare providers, organizations, and policymakers all share the responsibility of solving these challenges. Â Â Â Empowerment through books Submitted by Tamanna Gandhi Â Books hold a special power, allowing readers to escape into a fictional world, embark on thrilling adventures, learn historical and scientific facts, and experience a range of emotions. Â However, several studies report an evident gender imbalance in childrenâs novels. According to a study by Florida State University, among 6,000 childrenâs books published between 1900 and 2000, just 31% have female central characters. While this number has improved, a recent study published by the NIH finds that female protagonists remain underrepresented in childrenâs books. Â After noticing the lack of historical fiction books for older elementary school students that featured female protagonists, Tamanna Gandhi, a Washington High School student, was inspired to write her novel. Her goal was simple: create a historical fiction novel about the womenâs suffrage movement that was easy to read, included multiple perspectives, and revealed the theme of courage throughout the story. This led to the creation of her novel, Journey of Time: Silence, Suffrage, and Spirit, published as an e-book in October 2022 and later as a hardcover in July 2023. Â The story follows a 12-year-old girl who unexpectedly time-travels to the 1900s suffrage movement where she uncovers a history that inspires her to support her auntâs mayoral campaign and develop confidence. Â Tamanna is working towards making the book available to as many libraries and schools. Currently, you can find the book on Amazon.com. Â Â Â Mission, Vision, and Valuesâ¦Oh My!

However, itâs important to consider the environmental impact of these meals and aim for a zero-waste approach. The incredible amount of waste generated by school lunches, often laden with single-use packaging, poses a significant threat to our environment. Plastic bags, for instance, find their way into landfills and oceans, breaking down into smaller fragments that persist indefinitely, polluting soil and endangering wildlife. Â Fortunately, there are effective strategies that can be employed to create a zero-waste school lunch, benefiting both the planet and your wallet. Here are some key tips to help you achieve this goal: Â - Invest in an insulated lunch bag. This not only eliminates the need for disposable alternatives, but extends the freshness of the packed food. Â - Opt for reusable drink bottles. Swap out the single-use juice boxes and plastic water bottles for reusable options.Equip your child with a durable drink bottle that suits their preferences so theyâre excited to use it again and again. Many schools support and encourage the use of reusable bottles, contributing to reduced plastic waste on campus. Â - Choose reusable containers over plastic baggies. Bento boxes, designed for single-serving meals, present an organized and appealing way to transport food. Insulated thermoses maintain warmth for liquids like soup. Minimize waste and save money by opting for reusable food-grade snack bags (e.g., silicone bags) that are easy to clean and come in various sizes and designs. Â - Incorporate reusable utensils and cloth napkins. Replace disposable utensils with a reusable cutlery set of bamboo, metal, or sturdy plastic to minimize waste. Switch to fun cloth napkins that are cost-effective and eco-friendly, as they can be washed with your regular load of laundry. Â By adopting these simple adjustments to your lunch-packing routine, you can significantly reduce waste and contribute to a sustainable school campus. Hereâs to a fantastic and environmentally conscious school year! Â Â Â Honda Pilot Grows Up By Michael Coates Â The 2023 Honda Pilot SUV is in its fourth generation, bigger and more powerful than itâs ever been. With its new off-road-oriented TrailSport model and capacity to haul eight passengers, the Pilot stretches into new territory as the largest vehicle Honda offers in the U.S. Â What started as a more family-friendly big brother SUV to the most popular Honda, the compact CR-V, now stretches more than 200 inches long and can haul the infield and outfield of a kidâs baseball team (pitcher and catcher will need to find their own ride). The space is mainly people-oriented as luggage space is limited, so that imaginary baseball team may need to haul its equipment in another vehicle as well. Â Bigness is not a trait usually associated with Hondas, but the company carries it off well here. The TrailSport model, a mid-range trim line among the six offered with the Pilot, focuses on the currently trendy âadventureâ mode. It has off-road tires designed for better grip on a trail, skidplates to protect the undercarriage from damage, a higher ground clearance that also helps in that department, and suspension tuning designed to handle the challenges encountered in an off-road adventure. I didnât get the change to put the Pilotâs capability in this department to the test, but I have no reason to doubt Honda engineers have packed enough technology in this model to satisfy the weekend off-roader. Â Most Powerful Engine My faith in Hondaâs engineers was reinforced when I saw the powertrain package on the TrailSport. The base of the system is a 285 horsepower 3.5-liter V6, the most powerful engine Honda offers. Mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission and Hondaâs i-VTM4 all-wheel drive, all of the technology to handle most off-road situations is there. It has drive modes for snow, trail and sand; hill start assist and hill descent control; and pretty much everything youâll need, short of a winch for when you go a little too far. Â The engine power translates well on road as well. Unlike many powertrains in current cars, it rarely felt like it had to strain to keep up with traffic or accelerate when called on. The road driving dynamics were positive as well. It may be the biggest Honda ever, but it drove with the same efficient control youâd expect from smaller Honda. Properly equipped it can tow 5,000 pounds as well to add to the âadventureâ potential. Â Fuel economy on the Pilot felt low until I realized the bulk (4,685 pounds) that was being pulled around. The EPA official numbers are 18 mpg city, 23 highway, and 20 combined. My average with a freeway-heavy driving focus was on the high end of the EPA numbers. The consistency was the kind you expect from Honda. Â The Package One of the most impressive features of the Honda Pilot TrailSport I drove was how well-equipped it was, but the car had only one optionâits Diffused Blue Sky Pearl paint job (which I would describe as a gray-blue, fitting for the Pacific Northwest I was driving it in). With the paint premium and the destination and handling charge, the AWD Pilot was $50,500. Entry level 2WD Pilots start at $37,000, but most seem to hover closer to this range. Â As might be expected in this price range, the safety features in particular were extensive. Adaptive cruise control was on board along with a collision mitigation braking system, lane keeping assist system, road departure mitigation, traffic jam assist and nine airbags. Â Power assists were everywhere throughout the car, while the interior detail on the leather seats and trim added a nice touch. This is a family hauler ready for anything. Â Â Â Â HISTORY MATTERS Â By John Grimaldi and David Bruce Smith September 1 through September 15 Â The Fighting Turtle Submarines were crucial to the success of Americaâs defense strategy during the two World Wars [1914-1918; 1939-1945,] but their maiden missions actually happened at the time of the American Revolution. Â According to History.com, â[They] were first built by Dutch inventor Cornelius van Drebel in the early 17th century, but it was not until 150 years later that they were first used in naval combat. David Bushnell, an American inventor, began building underwater mines while a student at Yale University. Deciding that a submarine would be the best means of delivering his mines in warfare, he built an eight-foot-long wooden submersible that was christened the Turtle for its shape. Large enough to accommodate one operatorâ¦[it] was entirely hand powered. Lead ballast kept the craft balanced.â Â The Grateful American Book Prize recommends The American Turtle Submarine, The Best-Kept Secret of the American Revolution by Arthur Lefkowitz Â Â Declaring Independence In June 1776, Founding Father Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed a congressional resolution: âThat in all continental commissions, and other instruments, where, heretofore, the words âUnited Coloniesâ have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the United States.â Â History.com reports that âBy September, the Declaration of Independence had been drafted, signed, printed, and sent to Great Britain. What Congress had declared to be true on paper in July was clearly the case in practice, as Patriot blood was spilled against the British on the battlefields of Boston, Montreal, Quebec and New York. Congress had created a country from a cluster of colonies and the nationâs new name reflected that reality.â Â The Grateful American Book Prize endorses The Epic Story of 1776: 25 People, 13 Colonies and 1 War by Jenny L. Cote and Libby Carty McNamee. Â Â The Overland Mail Route As country-wide know-how ascended in the 19th century, postal service fell behind; to bolster it; the Overland Mail Company was rolled out on September 15, 1858, with an investment of $1 millionâ [$37,279,390 in 2023âs currency]. Â History.com says that funds were required to make a âwinding 2,800-mile route and [to build] way stations at 10â15-mile intervals. Teams of thundering horses soon raced across the wide-open spaces of the West, pulling custom-built Concord coaches with seats for nine passengers and a rear boot for the mail.â Â Known also as the Butterfield Overland Mail Company it âoperated from 1858 to 1861 under contract with the U.S. Postal Department, providing transportation of U.S. mail between St. Louis, Mo. and San Francisco, Calif. The route proposed by the Butterfield Mail Co. became known as the âOxbow Routeâ because of its shape on a map, starting in St. Louis and then dipping southwesterly through Missouri, western Arkansas, and the Indian Territory, turning west across Texas and southern New Mexico and Arizona, and then curving north again in California to finish at San Francisco,â according to the companyâs website.

Perhaps a neighbor snuck some onto your doorstep. Â Here are some recipe ideas: French fried zucchini, chocolate zucchini cake, sweet and sour zucchini, creamy zucchini smoothie, roasted zucchini with parmesan, zucchini fritters, zucchini curry, courgette puff pastry tarts, tuna-stuffed courgettes, etc. Â In England, the zucchini is call a courgette. In France, we have the âgreen gourd.â If this gets confusing, try âbaby marrowâ or cucurbita pepo. For a more scientific definition, you can look up squash, a definition that wanders into summer squash and winter squash. Zucchini is a type of small summer squash. Does this help? No? Â Iâve always been fascinated by English television programs, which talk about vicious marrow competitions. In case you are tempted to try, the largest marrow weighs 256 pounds 9.8 ounces. It was pampered on Walesâ Barry Island on a diet of fish guts and fish heads. Â Zucchini ancestors wandered into the Americas via Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, etc., following Columbus and his many 1492 travels. In the 1800s it was hybridized in Italy. Here the large size was called âzuccaâ and the small size became zucchini. Big and small, zucca and zucchini, were brought to the United States in about 1920 by Italian immigrants. Â Legally zucchini is a fruit, even though mostly everybody thinks it is a vegetable. If you want to see an enormous variety of fruits and veggies, including golden zucchini, zucchino rampicante and the Polish nimba zucchini, go to the National Heirloom Exposition in Ventura, California from September 12 to 14 (https://www.rareseeds.com/). Buy seeds. Next summer, have gifts for your neighbors. Bake marvelous zucchini bread. Save some for me â Pat. Â Â Â The Robot Report Autonomous farming machines By Mike Oitzman Â Apex.AI, a company that develops safety-certified software for mobility and autonomous applications, announced a joint product development project for commercial-ready autonomous farming systems with Krone, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery and precision agricultural technology, and Lemken, a company that manufactures innovative machines for tillage, sowing and sustainable plant care. The âCombined Powersâ concept vehicle, which was developed by Krone and Lemken, is an autonomous drive unit that acts as a smart system that can plow, cultivate, sow, mow, turn and swath. The companies are now transitioning the concept carrier vehicle from the prototype stage to series production by leveraging Apex.AIâs Software Development Kit (SDK), consisting of Apex.Grace and Apex.Ida. Â The commercial-ready âCombined Powersâ vehicle, which has already proven its performance in the fields, will save farmers valuable time in the future while maintaining the precise quality of work. There is a shortage of skilled workers in agriculture as in many other sectors. Therefore, farmers are increasingly relying on digitization and automation in order to make optimal use of the available work capacity and are increasingly leveraging innovative technology including robots that assist in livestock breeding or machines that work the fields highly autonomously. Â Key software functions of the âCombined Powersâ architecture are based on the Robot Operating System ROS, making it a logical decision to rely on Apex.AI products, which are also based on ROS. Unlike ROS, however, Apex.AIâs products are certified by TÃV Nord for applications with special functional safety requirements and are therefore suitable for commercial vehicle use. Due to the compatibility, the data obtained with the prototypes can be used directly in series development. This makes the Apex.AI software the ideal core component for the further development of the âCombined Powersâ products into series production. Â âApex.AI is establishing an operating software for the autonomous age. The partnership with Krone and Lemken is a win-win for all parties: Our development environment, consisting of Apex.Grace and Apex.Ida, is the perfect basis for the applications of Krones and Lemkens carrier vehicles. We are now working closely with both companies on a first project to familiarize the teams from the agricultural technology manufacturers with the suitability for series production and the possibilities of the Apex.AI products and methods. We will also evaluate our software as the framework and middleware solutions as part of the implementation phase of the VTE concept,â explains Jan Becker, CEO of Apex.AI.

Â Â Â Summer gardening routines continue into fall By Daniel O'Donnell Â Fire season in California is the time of the year that wildfires are most likely. Traditionally it was between May and October; however, with the changing climate, fire season has been steadily beginning earlier and ending later. The same is true with seasonal variations in the garden. Warm spring temperatures are coming earlier, and summer heat is lingering longer into fall. This is causing less predictable growing seasons. Gardeners are taking steps to protect their gardens from the changes a warmer climate is bringing in the same way precautions and change of habits are being enlisted to mitigate wildfires. September and October are two prime months to incorporate these changes. Â Changes in gardening techniques need to be implemented because extended warmer temperatures lengthen a plantâs growing season. This means many plants will need more water, and many non-irrigated native plants will be pushed beyond their limits for survival. An extended growing season can distort a plantâs natural life cycle, stressing the plant and creating dryer soils, which can strain a plantâs root system. Stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases and predators. Longer warmer temperatures also threaten plants by creating conditions for more generations of pests, pathogens, and invasive plant species to be created. Â What to do? First, check the irrigation systems for leaks, add additional irrigation to plants that look stressed, and adjust the timer to continue to water further into the fall. Many gardeners add compost and mulch to their gardens in spring. A late summer round of adding compost and re-mulching will help keep any additional water from evaporating. Putting water bowls throughout the garden will not only provide wildlife with water when it is scarce, but can dissuade squirrels, raccoons, mice, and others from chewing on irrigation lines to get water. Â Longer and warmer temperatures might change the historic ranges of some native plants. Planting a diverse range of native plants and other appropriate plants for the area will help keep the garden teeming with plants and wildlife even as the climate changes. A diversity of plants can also provide a longer range of blooming times so that migratory and local birds, butterflies, bees, and other pollinators do not arrive too early or too late to the garden for late summer food sources they might have become accustomed to. September is early for planting. However, it is a great time to start researching appropriate new plant candidates, where to purchase them, as well as clearing and preparing the places they can be planted come late fall or early winter. Â Planting more trees in the garden is one of the best ways to combat lingering heat. Trees absorb water and cool the surrounding area by releasing water vapor through their leaves in a process called transpiration. On a 90Â° day, a lawn surface will have a temperature of 105Â°, concrete 125Â°, and asphalt 140Â°. The ground temperature in the shade of a larger tree can be as much as 25 degrees cooler than the 90Â° air temperature. Shade from trees can also significantly cool a house, slow the deterioration of walkways and patios around the home, and provide heat protection for wildlife. Trees could be planted successfully in the past in early October but as warmer temperatures persist, November is becoming the new normal. Â There are a few other gardening adjustments that can be made to fight lingering heat. Shrubs and trees that are normally pruned towards the end of summer may need to be pruned as much as a month later so new growth will not be encouraged going into winter. Dead branches need to be cleared and trimmed later into the year, since fire season has been extended. Vegetable and annual plants will survive longer with prolonged warmth. However, they should be pulled out once signs of stress hit them. Weakened, they will only attract detrimental insects and pathogens, which can affect the health of other plants in the garden. Â Plants and wildlife will do their best to adapt to the lingering high temperatures. It will be our ability to change our gardening practices that will be the most crucial component in helping the garden and wildlife survive a changing climate.

Sweet opener. The Chabot College women's soccer team kicked off the 2023 season with a rousing 5-0 non-conference win over visiting Marin on Tuesday afternoon. Â Guided by first-year head coach Dan Chubbock, the Gladiators (1-0) led 2-0 at halftime on goals by Marin Michieli off a Natalia Lumley assist and a penalty kick by Margarita Vinciguerra after a handball. Michieli added a goal and an assist in the second half. Lumley had the goal off the Michieli pass, and Emily Hornig also found the net. Â âWe played well,â said a pleased Chubbock, noting the Glads âcompletely dominated the second half as Marin tired.â The impressive triumph came in Chabot's first match since the 2021 season; the program was dormant in 2022. Â Chubbock expects a much tougher test at Diablo Valley College in the team's next game, which âwill give us a true gauge of where we are at. â¦ Lots still to improve upon, but great to get a win to start the season!â the coach said. Â Â Â Oakland Roots Sports Club Announces California State University East Bay as 2024 Venue Submitted by Oakland Roots Â Oakland Roots Sports Club announces California State University, East Bay, as the home venue for the upcoming 2024 season as work continues to build the Clubâs own soccer stadium at the Malibu Lot, adjacent to the Coliseum located in East Oakland, in time for the 2025 season. Playing soccer at the Malibu lot in Oakland is poised to be discussed at the City Council's Community and Economic Development meeting next Tuesday, September 12, and after that it would proceed to the full City Council. Â In order to submit preferred home dates for the 2024 USL Championship season, the Club needed to have a set venue with available dates. California State University, East Bay presented the Club with the only viable pathway that is ready today. Â Pioneer Stadium at California State University, East Bay has drawn some of Oakland Roots' largest crowds in history and established an accessible, reliable, and family friendly environment in a beautiful location. The doubleheader event featuring Oakland Roots and Soul, with fans packing the stands, set a new attendance record for the Club and countless other memories have been made at East Bay this season. Â âCalifornia State University, East Bay has been tremendously accommodating by making their venue available to Oakland Roots,â said Club President Lindsay Barenz. âWe explored a number of options in Oakland for the final 12 months before we open our own stadium, but each came with a high degree of uncertainty and the potential for more disruption for our fans. We came to the conclusion that focusing on having our own venue at the Malibu Lot ready to go for 2025 should be the number one priority.â Â Options explored by the Club for 2024 included the C Lot at the Coliseum site and a return to Laney College. While the Club and Laney actively explored potential ways to address the field issue, a workable solution was not found in time for the 2024 season. The C Lot at the Coliseum was considered as a potential stopgap solution for one season, however the time, effort, and financial resources required for a one-year solution would set back the Club's goal of securing a 10-year stadium arrangement at the adjacent Malibu Lot by 2025. Â With the 2024 venue now set, Oakland Roots Members will receive communication regarding 2024 Membership renewals in the coming days. Fans who would like to become new Members in 2024 will be able to place a deposit starting on September 23 at 10 a.m. Fans who hold a 2024 Membership will receive priority access for 2025 seats in the Malibu Lot Stadium before new Memberships are made available to the general public. Â Â Â Mt. Eden hosts WACC Flag Football Jamboree By Eric Donato Â Mt. Eden High School (Hayward), on Saturday, September 9, hosted a historic East Bay high school sports event. The event was the first-ever West Alameda County Conference (WACC) Flag Football Jamboree for girls. A “jamboree” is a festival celebration, and indeed it was, for the participating young female athletes who now have the opportunity to join an organized high school football team. Â Gary Duran, athletic director at Mt. Eden, notes the significance of the event, “Well, I think the sport in general, what this day means for our league, the WACC is, it's our inaugural flag football. We have seven schools represented today, with over 200 student athletes that are participating for the first time in flag football. So, we're super excited about that.” The participating schools for the event were San Leandro, Encinal (Alameda), Piedmont, Mt. Eden, Tennyson (Hayward), Berkeley and Alameda. Â Mt. Eden Monarch's home football field was buzzing with non-stop scrimmaging action as two pairs of competing school teams played simultaneously on each half of the football field. The game showcase format allowed each team fifteen minutes of offense and defense running time versus each opponent. Flag football is similar to regular football in terms of downs played with endzone scoring, with the ball advanced through rushing and passing plays. A stark difference is the contactless nature of the game. Instead of stopping a play by tackling a player to the ground, the defending side tries to remove the opponent's flags from the ball carrier to end a down. The flags are two pieces of foot-long cloth loosely attached to each side of the player's waist. Another missing element in the flag football game is the field goal and punting. Instead, the ball is reset to the 40-yard mark if the line of gain is not reached. Â Sandra Hernandez, head coach for the San Leandro female flag football team, shares the day's excitement, “This Jamboree is a big deal and super exciting for our young female athletes. For many of them, this is their first time playing flag football. I am excited to see this sport grow and continue to build this San Leandro Female Flag Football program. We are making history, and it is very exciting.” Mrs. Bell, a counselor for Mt Eden, echoes the sentiment, “I'm thinking back when I was in high school, and I wish we would've had this when we were growing up, and I think, our girls are hungry. You can't hide that Mt. Eden Monarch pride. I'm just proud of our young ladies.” Â Alameda coach Michael Lee describes his team's excitement, “Well, I think the girls are a little nervous. Some haven't played sports or been on a team before. For some of the girls who play other sports, this is another opportunity for them to participate and condition for their other sports as well. But it's just a huge thing.” Tennyson quarterback and receiver Eliana Estrada shares the excitement with confidence, “I feel good because I feel like we have a good team. Defense-wise, I think it's pretty good.” Â The importance of the event is also appreciated by the parents, who were the loudest cheerleaders of the day. Christine Holmes proudly states her excitement for her daughter, who plays for San Leandro and also for the Alameda flag football coed travel team, “She's been playing flag football since she was 10. This is her last year at high school, and we are so excited that she is joining the school's first girl flag football team.” Â Â Follow along with this exciting inaugural high school sport by checking out the WACC website https://www.westalamedacountyconference.org. Â Â Â Lions Club of Hayward Silicon Valley hosts 10,000 meal packing charity event Submitted by James Varghese Â In a display of compassion and dedication to serving those in need, the Lions Club of Hayward Silicon Valley organized a meal-packing event at Hayward Veterans Memorial Hall on Sunday, September 10. Â Around 70 volunteers, including Lions Clubs District Officers, gathered at the venue at 12 noon to contribute their time and effort. This philanthropic initiative aimed to alleviate hunger in the community while also raising awareness about global hunger. Â Club President Sunil Bhakta welcomed the enthusiastic volunteers, acknowledging their commitment to making a difference. Before commencing the program, a representative from the Rise Against Hunger program, Douglas Vu, provided a brief orientation to familiarize the volunteers with the meal packing process. Â Several tables were stocked with nutritious meals containing rice, soy protein, dehydrated vegetables, and a vitamin and mineral packet. Lions District Governor Manil Babu Shrestha officially inaugurated the event by hitting a gong. Â Volunteers then proceeded to work in an assembly line, diligently packaging the meals. The process involved meticulous tasks such as measuring and pouring ingredients into bags, weighing and sealing the bags, and finally packing them into boxes. In a remarkable display of efficiency, the volunteers packed an impressive total of 10,152 meals in just over two hours. Â The impact of this event extended beyond providing meals to those in need. Each gathering of like-minded individuals served as an opportunity for the community to unite and raise awareness about the prevalent issue of global hunger. Past District Governor James Varghese emphasized the importance of such initiatives, emphasizing that they not only address hunger but also foster a sense of community care. Â During his welcome speech, Club President Sunil Bhakta highlighted several noteworthy projects undertaken by the Lions Club of Hayward Silicon Valley. These projects include financing and partnering with a school for special needs children in Southern India, sponsoring and supporting the treatment of 30 children with cancer, supporting a blind school where 20 women are acquiring skills for livelihood and independence, and providing assistance to the Salinas School District Family Resource Center, where over 50% of students are unhoused. Â Volunteers of all ages, including children, actively participated in this charitable endeavor. Student volunteers were recognized for their efforts and received certificates acknowledging their volunteer credit. Many expressed their enjoyment of the teamwork and inquired about future meal-packing events. Â Lions Club of Hayward Silicon Valleyâs commitment to service continues to inspire others to join hands and work towards building healthier and more supportive communities.

As we have a wheelchair user in our family, we are always exploring accessible parks and trails. Â This time we explored the beautiful California Nursery Historical Park. California Nursery Historical Park is a completely wheelchair-accessible hidden gem located at the historic Niles Canyon Boulevard, in Fremont. Itâs a unique combination of a beautiful garden and a little forest of trees in planters. The floral garden is beautiful with different types of colorful roses, magnolias, calla lillies, and a giant cactus. The rose garden provides a lovely background for pictures. The windmill and the wooden arch with a bench inside are everyoneâs favorite. The blooming rose vines covering the little window and the fountain add to the locationâs beauty. Â There is a nice path along towering boxed trees which gives the feeling of a little forest. There are accessible benches scattered around the park, in case people want to sit down and admire the beauty of the park. There is a little history museum which opens on Sundays. Overall, itâs a quiet place to enjoy a leisurely stroll. Â Wheelchair accessible The most amazing aspect of this park is the accessibility. The entire park is paved and wheelchair accessible. There is accessible parking at the entrance, and there are a few accessible restrooms too. When you visit the park, make sure to visit both sides of the road as the garden and the boxed trees are on opposite sides.

Teacher Samuel Paty was killed outside his school in 2020 after showing his class cartoons of the prophet of Islam during a debate on free expression. The attacker, a young Chechen who had radicalized, was killed by police. The court found five of the defendants, who were 14 and 15 at the time of the attack, guilty of staking out the teacher and identifying him for the attacker. Another defendant, 13 at the time, was found guilty of lying about the classroom debate in a comment that aggravated online anger against the teacher. The teenagers — all students at Paty’s school — testified that they didn’t know the teacher would be killed. All were handed brief or suspended prison terms, and required to stay in school or jobs during the duration of their suspended terms with regular medical checkups. They left the courtroom without speaking. Some had their heads down as they listened to the verdicts. One appeared to wipe tears. Paty’s name was disclosed on social media after a class debate on free expression during which he showed prophet caricatures published by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The publication had triggered a deadly extremist massacre in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom in 2015. Paty, a history and geography teacher, was killed on Oct. 16, 2020, near his school in a Paris suburb by attacker Abdoullakh Anzorov. The five who identified Paty to the attacker were convicted of involvement in a group preparing aggravated violence. The sixth defendant wrongly claimed that Paty had asked Muslim students to raise their hands and leave the classroom before he showed the class the prophet cartoons. She was not in the classroom that day, and later told investigators she had lied. She was convicted of making false allegations. Her father shared the lie in an online video that called for mobilization against the teacher. He and a radical Islamic activist who helped disseminate virulent messages against Paty are among eight adults who will face a separate trial for adults suspected of involvement in the killing, expected late next year. The trial was held behind closed doors, and the media are not allowed to disclose the defendants’ identities according to French law regarding minors. The proceedings come weeks after a teacher was fatally stabbed and three other people injured in northern France in October in a school attack by a former student suspected of Islamic radicalization. That killing occurred in a context of global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and led French authorities to deploy 7,000 additional soldiers across the country to bolster security and vigilance."

Fahren James alleges she was badly injured when she was shot by officers multiple times with so-called “less-lethal” projectiles on May 30, 2020, outside CBS Studios, when citizens were protesting the killing of Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police five days earlier, according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court. Attorneys representing the defendants had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit James filed in 2021, arguing that the protest was unlawful and the officers actions were not intended to stifle free speech. They also argued that they did not use excessive force on James, and that the doctrine of qualified immunity shielded the officers from civil action, among other claims. U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall reviewed officers’ body-worn camera footage, and evidence and argument presented by the plaintiff’s attorney before issuing her decision Tuesday. The judge determined that a reasonable jury could find James’ act of protesting was a substantial motivating factor in the officers’ conduct. “Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to (James), a reasonable jury could conclude that (her) act of protesting at an anti-police rally was a substantial factor that motivated the defendant officers’ conduct,” Marshall wrote. The lawsuit alleges First and Fourth Amendment violations made by LAPD, including excessive force and retaliation against peaceful protestors. “This decision, allowing Ms. James’ case to proceed, is a beacon of hope for the protection of free speech and against police brutality,” James’ attorney V. James DeSimone said in a statement. “The court recognized the gravity of the allegations and the importance of allowing a jury to hear Ms. James’ story. This is a step forward in our relentless pursuit of justice and ensuring the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters is respected.”"

Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said one of the intercepted letters contained a “white powder substance” and urged caution to people who receive suspicious mail without a return address. Police later said the powder was found to be harmless. The suspected shooter, 67-year-old Anthony Polito, was shot and killed by police at the scene of the shooting Wednesday, officials said, adding he applied to numerous higher education jobs throughout Nevada, including UNLV. Two of the victims of the shooting were UNLV professors, though it is unknown whether Polito knew them. The identity of the third victim was not released because police had yet to contact their family, police said. A fourth victim, also a UNLV professor, was described as in life-threatening condition at a local hospital. McMahill said Polito had a list of professors at UNLV and East Carolina University, where he previously worked, in his possession when he was killed. A motive is still unclear, he said. None of the faculty members on the list was a victim in the attack, McMahill added. During a search of Polito’s apartment nearby, police said a document appearing to serve as a last will and testament was found, and an eviction notice was posted on the apartment door. When Polito was shot and killed by police, he was headed toward the nearby student union. The gunman had more than 150 rounds of ammunition on him, McMahill said, adding he was “glad [the shooter] didn’t get out of UNLV.” “Yesterday was the most difficult day in the history of our university,” UNLV President Keith Whitfield said in a statement Thursday. “Words are still hard to come by as we’re only beginning to process the grief, loss, anger, and fear associated with Wednesday’s tragic campus shooting that took the lives of three of our cherished faculty members.

Polito, who was shot and killed by police, injured a fourth person during the shooting inside a UNLV business school building, authorities said. The victim, a visiting male professor, is being treated for life-threatening injuries, McMahill said Thursday. The 67-year-old Polito had written a âtarget listâ that included âpeople he was seeking on the university campus as well as faculty from the Eastern Carolina University,â McMahill said Thursday, though he noted none of the faculty members shot Wednesday were on the list. McMahill did not explain what led investigators to believe it was a list of targets or where the document was found. It is still unclear why Polito, who lived in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, targeted UNLV or if he had any connection to the school. He had worked at schools in Georgia and North Carolina, his now-removed LinkedIn page showed, including as a business professor at Eastern Carolina University. And in recent years he worked as an adjunct instructor at and attended Roseman University in Henderson, ending his association with the school in 2022, the school confirmed. Polito had unsuccessfully applied to several higher education jobs in Nevada and appeared to be struggling financially, McMahill said Thursday, noting an eviction notice was found on the door of his Henderson apartment. In the hours leading up to the shooting, Polito had mailed 22 letters to university personnel across the country with no return address, the sheriff said. At least some of the envelopes had a white powder in them, but the substance was found to be harmless, Las Vegas police said Thursday evening. Further details about the lettersâ contents werenât immediately released. Detectives are working with the postal inspector and federal personnel to process the letters, but are asking people who work in academia who receive a letter with no return address to âproceed with caution,â McMahill said. UNLV president Keith Whitfield described the shooting, which happened just days before the start of final exams, as âthe most difficult day in the history of our university.â The shooting began shortly before noon on Wednesday inside the universityâs Beam Hall, where professors had been preparing students for the tests to come. Outside, a gathering of students was enjoying games, food and other activities. Two of the people killed were business school professors Patricia Navarro-Velez and Cha-Jan âJerryâ Chang, the president said Thursday in a letter to the school community. The name of the third slain faculty member will be released after that personâs relatives are notified, he said. âI wonât sugarcoat it. We are all hurting right now,â Whitfield said. âBut itâs in these trying times that we need to lean on one another for support.â UNLV mourns beloved faculty In his letter to the university community, Whitfield acknowledged the shock many on campus are grappling with following the loss of several beloved faculty members. âWords are still hard to come by as weâre only beginning to process the grief, loss, anger, and fear associated with Wednesdayâs tragic campus shooting that took the lives of three of our cherished faculty members,â Whitfield wrote. Navarro-Velez, an assistant professor of accounting, had been teaching at the school for almost five years and had âdevoted her career to educating the next generation of accountants,â the president said. The second slain professor, Chang, had been teaching UNLVâs business school students for more than 20 years as a âlongtime educator of management information systems,â Whitfield said. Navarro-Velez, 39, worked on the fourth floor of Beam Hall and Chang, 64, worked on the third floor, according to the sheriff. Ammunition, electronics found at shooterâs home Investigators found several computers and hard drive components were found while searching Politoâs apartment, the sheriff said Thursday. Investigators are scrubbing the devices and scouring Politoâs social media in an effort to gain insight into any possible motive, he said. Additionally, authorities discovered ammunition consistent with cartridges found at the scene of the shooting, as well as a Taurus box matching the handgun police believe the gunman used, he noted. On a chair, investigators also discovered a document similar to a âlast will and testament,â McMahill said. Gunman was fascinated by Vegas and conspiracy theories Politoâs online writings paint a picture of a man who was fascinated by Las Vegas and had an interest in various conspiracy theories. His personal website includes a handful of syllabuses for his past courses but is largely a list of hundreds of links related to his personal interests entitled âResources.â While the list includes ordinary topics like âTravelâ and âShopping,â one section is devoted to âPowerful Organizations Bent on Global Domination!â It also includes links to common conspiracy theory fodder like Freemasonry, the Trilateral Commission and âThe Rothchild (sic) Family.â George Soros, a common target for antisemitic conspiracy theories, is listed as one of the âGreat Minds of the Twentieth Century,â alongside Albert Einstein and others. Three of Politoâs former students say he spoke frequently about Las Vegas and visited the city as much as he could while teaching in other states. His website also notes he had made âmore than two dozen trips to Vegas over the last fifteen years,â although it was not clear when the statement was originally posted. Jonathan Peralta, who was in one of Politoâs classes at ECU in 2013 or 2014, told CNN Polito had an unorthodox teaching style and would usually start his classes with stories, frequently about Las Vegas. âThis was surprising,â Peralta said of the UNLV shooting. âThe Vegas connection is what makes it so crazy because he would talk about Vegas so much.â Polito worked at ECUâs college of business from 2001 until he resigned in 2017, when he was a tenured associate professor, a college spokesperson told CNN. He had ties to Nevadaâs Roseman University from October 2018 to June 2022, attending the school and working as an adjunct professor, a school spokesperson said. How the shooting unfolded Authorities still are trying to piece together what happened inside Beam Hall, which does not have interior cameras, but have been able to construct a timeline of events before and after Polito entered the building, the sheriff said. Polito arrived at the university just before 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, and police began receiving 911 calls around 11:45 a.m. about a shooting at the university, prompting both on- and off-duty law enforcement to rush to the campus, according to McMahill. University and city police arrived on the scene and entered Beam Hall, where classrooms of students and professors were preparing for exams next week, the sheriff said. The first officer got to the scene within 78 seconds of the first 911 call, according to Adam Garcia, the director of university police services, southern command. Polito, armed with a 9 mm pistol and nine loaded magazines, made his way through multiple floors of the building before exiting around 11:55 a.m., the sheriff said. Outside, he confronted university police and a shootout ensued, McMahill said. Polito was shot multiple times and collapsed, McMahill said. He was then arrested and died at the scene, he added. âOfficers then assembled action teams and began a systematic search for additional suspects and victims. Those teams went through multiple buildings and multiple floors. Many times we had to force entry into rooms where students and faculty were sheltering in place,â sheriff said. The fear and panic on campus evoked memories of the Route 91 Harvest music festival massacre, which took place near UNLV on October 1, 2017, and remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Wednesdayâs tragedy marked the 80th school shooting in the US so far this year, 29 of which have been on university and college campuses, according to a CNN analysis."

Polito, armed with a 9 mm pistol and nine loaded magazines, also injured a visiting male professor in a building that is part of the business school. That man was being treated for life-threatening injuries, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Thursday. None of the faculty members shot Wednesday were on Politoâs âtarget list,â which included âpeople he was seeking on the university campus as well as faculty from the Eastern Carolina University,â McMahill said. The sheriff did not explain what led investigators to believe it was a list of targets or where they found the document. It remained unclear why Polito, who lived in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, targeted UNLV or if he had any connection to the school. He had unsuccessfully applied to several higher education jobs in Nevada and appeared to be struggling financially, McMahill said. An eviction notice was found on the door of Politoâs Henderson apartment, the sheriff said. And in the hours leading up to the shooting, Polito had mailed 22 letters to university personnel across the country with no return address, he said. At least some of the envelopes had a harmless white powder in them, Las Vegas police said Thursday evening more details about the lettersâ contents werenât immediately released. Detectives are asking people in academia who get a letter with no return address to âproceed with caution,â McMahill said. UNLV mourns beloved faculty The shooting, just days before the start of final exams, was âthe most difficult day in the history of our university,â UNLV president Keith Whitfield said. Killed were business school professors Patricia Navarro-Velez and Cha-Jan âJerryâ Chang, Whitfield said Thursday in a letter to the school community. The name of the third slain faculty member will be released after that personâs relatives are notified, he said. âI wonât sugarcoat it. We are all hurting right now,â Whitfield said. âBut itâs in these trying times that we need to lean on one another for support. âWords are still hard to come by as weâre only beginning to process the grief, loss, anger, and fear associated with Wednesdayâs tragic campus shooting that took the lives of three of our cherished faculty members,â Whitfield wrote. Navarro-Velez, 39, an assistant professor of accounting, had been teaching at the school for almost five years and had âdevoted her career to educating the next generation of accountants,â Whitfield said. Chang, 64, had been teaching UNLVâs business school students for more than 20 years on âmanagement information systems,â Whitfield said. The gunman: Ammunition and conspiracies Investigators found several computers and hard drive components while searching Politoâs apartment and are reviewing the devices and Politoâs social media for a possible motive, the sheriff said. Authorities also found ammunition like cartridges found at the scene of the shooting, as well as a box matching the gun police believe Polito used, McMahill said. On a chair, investigators also discovered a document similar to a âlast will and testament,â he said. Politoâs online writings show interest in the gambling capital and in conspiracy theories. His personal website lists a section devoted to âPowerful Organizations Bent on Global Domination!â and includes links to common conspiracy theory fodder like Freemasonry, the Trilateral Commission and âThe Rothchild (sic) Family.â Billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a common target for antisemitic conspiracy theories, is listed as one of the âGreat Minds of the Twentieth Century,â alongside Albert Einstein. Meanwhile, three of Politoâs former students say he spoke frequently about Las Vegas and visited the city as much as he could while teaching in other states. His website notes he had made âmore than two dozen trips to Vegas over the last fifteen years,â although it was not clear when the statement was posted. Polito had an unorthodox teaching style and often opened classes with Las Vegas stories, said Jonathan Peralta, who was in one of Politoâs classes at Eastern Carolina University in 2013 or 2014. âThis was surprising,â Peralta told CNN of the UNLV shooting. âThe Vegas connection is what makes it so crazy because he would talk about Vegas so much.â Polito worked at Eastern Carolina Universityâs college of business from 2001 until he resigned in 2017, when he was a tenured associate professor, a college spokesperson told CNN. He had ties to Nevadaâs Roseman University from October 2018 to June 2022, attending the school and working as an adjunct professor, a school spokesperson said. He also had worked in academia in Georgia, his now-removed LinkedIn page showed. How the shooting unfolded Polito got to the university just before 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, just minutes before the shooting erupted in Beam Hall as professors were preparing their classes for upcoming tests and students outdoors were enjoying games, food and other activities. Police began getting 911 calls around 11:45 a.m., prompting officers to rush to the campus, McMahill said. Officers entered Beam Hall â which lacks interior cameras, the sheriff said â with the first officer arriving within 78 seconds of the first 911 call, said Adam Garcia of University Police Services. Polito made his way through multiple floors of the building, where Navarro-Velez worked on the fourth floor and Chang on the third floor, the sheriff said. The gunman left the building around 11:55 a.m., he said. University police outdoors confronted Polito, who was shot repeatedly and collapsed, was arrested and died there, McMahill said. âOfficers then assembled action teams and began a systematic search for additional suspects and victims,â he said. âThose teams went through multiple buildings and multiple floors. Many times we had to force entry into rooms where students and faculty were sheltering in place.â CNNâs Cheri Mossburg, Jillian Sykes, Andy Rose and Evan Perez contributed to this report.

A French juvenile court is handing down a verdict Friday Dec.8, 2023 for six teenagers accused of involvement in the killing of teacher Samuel Paty, beheaded by an Islamic extremist after he showed caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad to his class for a debate on freedom of expression. PARIS (AP) â A French juvenile court on Friday convicted six teenagers for their roles in the 2020 beheading of a teacher by an Islamic extremist, an attack that shocked the country and shone a light on the real-world dangers of online hate speech. Samuel Paty, a history and geography teacher, was killed near his school after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. Attacker Abdoullakh Anzorov, a young Chechen who had become radicalized, was killed by police. The court found five of the defendants, who were 14 and 15 at the time of the attack, guilty of involvement in staking out the teacher and identifying him for the attacker. The sixth defendant, 13 at the time, was found guilty of lying about the classroom debate in a comment that aggravated online anger against the teacher. After the ruling, the six defendants left the courtroom without speaking. Some had their heads down as they listened to the verdict. One appeared to wipe tears. The teenagers â all students at Patyâs school â acknowledged wrongdoing, and testified that they didnât know the teacher would be killed. One was given a six-month prison term but allowed to serve it under house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The others were given special suspended sentences of between two and three years requiring them to stay in school or jobs and attend regular medical meetings. The sentences included special educative follow-up measures that also involved their families. Lawyers for Patyâs family decried the sentences as too lenient. Lawyers for the teenagers expressed relief. Patyâs name was disclosed on social media after the class debate, during which he showed caricatures of Islam's prophet published by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The publication had triggered a deadly extremist massacre in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom in 2015. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims in France and around the world, who see them as sacrilegious. But Paty's killing reinforced the French stateâs commitment to freedom of expression, and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. The five who identified Paty to the attacker were convicted of involvement in a group preparing aggravated violence. Recommended for you The sixth defendant wrongly claimed that Paty had asked Muslim students to raise their hands and leave the classroom before he showed the class the cartoons. She was not in the classroom that day, and later told investigators she had lied. She was convicted of making false allegations. Her lawyer Mbeko Tebula said she ââdoesnât forgive herself for this lie.ââ ââShe didnât imagine it would â¦ turn into so much horror,ââ he said. ââShe was 13.ââ âShe will try to move forward,â he said. ""She will try to rebuild herself as a woman. To live with this permanent guilt, which will not pass through her but will inhabit her.ââ The girl's father shared the lie in an online video that called for mobilization against the teacher. Now incarcerated, her father and a radical Islamic activist who helped disseminate virulent messages against Paty are among eight adults who will face a separate trial for adults suspected of involvement in the killing, expected late next year. Lawyer Virginie Le Roy, representing Patyâs family, had tears in her eyes as she described her anger that the punishment was not tougher. ââYes, I am emotional. I am emotional for this family, also for the memory of Samuel. A man decapitated in the street is not nothing. We are in France. This was in 2020,ââ she said. The sentences are ""a bad signal to the family of Samuel, a bad signal to the students, and a bad signal to teachers.ââ Teachers at the school and Paty's relatives were in the courtroom along with some of the defendantsâ parents. Family members of the teenagers comforted each other afterward, some looking depleted or resigned. They refused to speak to reporters. The media are not allowed to disclose the defendants' identities, according to the French law regarding minors. The proceedings come weeks after a teacher was fatally stabbed and three other people were injured in northern France in October, in a school attack by a former student suspected of Islamic radicalization. That killing occurred in a context of global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and led French authorities to deploy 7,000 additional soldiers across the country to bolster security and vigilance.

Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling announced the decision Thursday night after the conclusion of personnel hearings. A fourth officer was suspended. The mayorâs office did not name the officers. The city’s police chief previously said departmental policies were violated with the shooting. Thirty-nine-year-old Steve Perkins was shot and killed by police on Sept. 29. Officers said he brandished a handgun when they accompanied a tow truck driver trying to repossess Perkinsâ truck. The shooting has drawn regular protests in the north Alabama city."

Cha-Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64, died Wednesday when a gunman went into his office in Beam Hall at the school, shooting him and two other faculty members, according to the Associated Press. Chang, who lived in Henderson, Nev., was an associate professor in the business school’s Management, Entrepreneurship & Technology department and had been teaching at UNLV since 2001. He earned his master’s degree in May 1986 at CMU before going on to obtain masters and doctorate degrees at Texas A&M University, and the University of Pittsburgh, according to his online resume. He earned a bachelor of science degree in oceanography from National Taiwan Ocean University, according to his resume. Keith E. Whitfield, president of UNLV, issued a statement on the university’s website and social media, saying he is heartbroken for the families of Chang and the other faculty members killed after disgruntled professor Anthony Polito, 67, stuffed loaded handguns into his waistband, walked into Beam Hall and committing the murders. A visiting professor was left with life-threatening wounds in the attack and was taken to a local hospital for treatment, according to the Associated Press. “Dr. Chang was a longtime educator of management information systems, spending more than 20 years of his academic career teaching a generation of UNLV Lee Business School students,” Whitfield said in the statement. CMU Communications officials said there are no longer any faculty at CMU who were teaching at the university during Chang’s tenure as a graduate student. About 10 minutes after the first reports of shots fired, police shot and killed Polito, who is said to have been denied jobs at various Nevada colleges and universities. Police found nine magazines for a 9mm handgun he’d legally purchased last year, along with a list of targets at UNLV, although police said none of the people shot were on the list, according to the AP. The university remained closed Friday, but was tentatively scheduled to re-open next week for final exams, the AP reported. Polito arrived at UNLV at 11:28 a.m. Wednesday, about 15 minutes before the shootings, in a 2007 Lexus he parked in a lot south of the business school, according to Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill. He got out of the car, put items in his waistband and entered Beam hall at 11:33 a.m.; the first reports of gunfire came at 11:45 a.m., according to the AP. Terrified students and professors cowered in classrooms and offices as the gunman roamed the top three floors of UNLV’s five-story Lee Business School. University and city police swarmed into and outside the building. UNLV police Chief Adam Garcia has said the first university officer arrived at the business school within 78 seconds of the gunfire report. Near the main entrance, UNLV officers saw Polito leaving the building and he shot at them, a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department statement said Thursday night. The officers fired back, killing him at the scene. Authorities searched Beam Hall and found two people dead on the third floor and one victim dead on the fourth floor, the statement said. Investigators believe the wounded survivor was shot on the fifth floor, but he managed to make it to the ground floor. Student Jordan Eckermann, who was in a second-floor classroom in the business school when the rampage began, said the timestamp on a short cellphone video he recorded showed the building’s alarm went off at 11:48 a.m., three minutes after the shooting started. It’s unclear how many shots Polito fired, but the sheriff said Polito brought more than 150 rounds of ammunition to the campus. Given that sheer number of rounds, McMahill said he believed Polito may have been intending to open fire on the student union next to the business school, where students were hanging out, eating and playing games. Polito also was carrying what McMahill described as a “target list” of named faculty members both from UNLV and from East Carolina University in North Carolina, where Polito taught at the university’s business school from 2001 to 2017. He resigned from East Carolina as a tenured associate professor, according to a statement Thursday from the university. “None of the individuals on the target list became a victim,” McMahill said, adding that police have contacted everyone on the suspect’s list, except for one person who was on a flight. A dash camera in Polito’s car showed that before heading to campus, he stopped at a post office in Henderson, where he was living, police said. Police discovered that he had dropped off 22 letters to university faculty members across the U.S. Some contained an unknown white powder that was later found to be harmless, police said. Police didn’t immediately disclose the nature of the letters or other details. The sheriff said at a news conference that investigators were still looking into a motive but noted that Polito applied for several jobs at various colleges and universities in Nevada and was denied the job each time. However, Roseman University of Health Sciences in Henderson said Polito had an adjunct faculty contract and taught two courses in the school’s the Master of Business Administration program from October 2018 to June 2022. He left when the program was discontinued, said Jason Roth, a spokesperson for the school. Authorities on Thursday said Polito appeared to be struggling financially. When they arrived at his apartment Wednesday night to search the property, they found an eviction notice taped to his front door, McMahill said. Inside, detectives found a chair with an arrow pointing down to a document “similar to a last will and testament,” McMahill said without elaborating. The attack at UNLV terrified a city that experienced the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history in October 2017, when a gunman killed 60 people and wounded more than 400 after opening fire from the window of a high-rise suite at Mandalay Bay on the Las Vegas Strip, just miles from the UNLV campus. It wasn’t immediately clear how long Polito had been living in the Las Vegas area. One of Polito’s former students at East Carolina, Paul Whittington, said Polito often talked about his regular trips to Las Vegas. He also seemed obsessive over anonymous student reviews at the end of each semester, Whittington said. Polito told Whittington’s class that he remembered the faces of students who gave him bad reviews and would express that he was sure who they were and where they sat, pointing at seats in the classroom, Whittington said. “He always talked about the negative feedback he got,” said Whittington, now 33, who took Polito’s intro to operations management class in 2014. “He didn’t get a lot of it, but there would always be one student every semester, or at least one student every class, that would give a negative review. And he fixated on those.” Ben Finley reported from Norfolk, Virginia.

Stephen Perkins, 39, was fatally shot by police outside his home in the northern Alabama city of Decatur on September 29 after he allegedly âbrandished a handgunâ equipped with a light âtowards an officer with the Decatur Police Department,â the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said in a statement weeks ago. This led the officer to open fire at Perkins, the agency added. Perkins died later at a hospital, police said. The cityâs mayor decided to fire three officers and suspend one after Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion concluded in a hearing that the officers violated policy, Pinion said in a news release Thursday. The release did not say what the violations were. Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling told reporters he made the decision for each officer, and said a state law prohibits city officials from releasing certain information Thursday, including the officersâ names or how they violated policy. âPer Alabama law, there is an exception to the public records law that covers sensitive personnel records. Officersâ names and the specific policy violations along with specific decisions remain sensitive to personnel records and cannot be made public at this point in the process,â Bowling said Thursday in a news conference. âHowever, if any of the officers choose to appeal these decisions, their names charges and additional details will become public as part of a potential personnel board appeals hearing,â the mayor said, adding those hearings would be publicized. The officers have seven days beginning Thursday to file an appeal, city attorney Herman Marks Jr. said during the news conference. The suspended officer âwasÂ foundÂ toÂ beÂ involvedÂ toÂ aÂ lesserÂ degreeâ based on the reviewed facts of the case, the mayor said. âIt is now incumbent on us as a city, as people who love Decatur, to move forward and to work to ensure that this tragedy is not forgotten or ignored,â Bowling said. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency still is conducting a criminal investigation, Pinion said. That probe is independent of the completed investigation by Decatur police, he said. âAs I have said from the earliest days, we will accept whatever decision results from that process,â Pinion said. CNN has reached out to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency for an update on the investigation. How police initially described the shooting, and then changed the account The incident unfolded around 1:30 a.m. September 29 when Decatur officers were called to Perkinsâ home by a towing company that alleged heâd pulled out a handgun on the tow truck driver as the driver was trying to repossess a car in Perkinsâ driveway, according to an initial statement from Decatur police. When officers arrived at the home with the tow truck driver, Perkins âexited the residence armed with a handgun and began to threaten the tow truck driver,â police said. The initial police statement said Perkins refused to drop his weapon when officers ordered him to do so, and that an officer shot him when he turned the gun toward that officer. However, the police chief subsequently said the officer did not order Perkins to drop a weapon. âWe now know the officer identified themselves as âpoliceâ and ordered Mr. Perkins to âget on the groundâ prior to the officer firing rather than ordering him to drop the weapon at that time as we initially reported the morning of the shooting,â Pinion said in a social media post October 11. âThat means that we also erred in stating Mr. Perkins ârefusedâ to drop his firearm prior to the shooting. I apologize for the inaccurate description of the encounter in our initial statement,â Pinionâs post reads. Shortly after the shooting, Perkinsâ brother told CNN that Perkins feared dying at the hands of police. âThis has always been his biggest fear, being shot and killed by police. Just being a Black man in America, it was his fear,â Nicholas Perkins, his eldest brother, told CNN for a story published in early October. âThis is a very hard loss; he was such a likeable guy. He had no enemies.â Stephen Perkins was married and left behind two children, his brother said. âHe was a great guy, a family man,â his brother said. âHis favorite hobby was going to the gym. Thatâs all he did. Work, home and gym. He was always smiling, laughing and joking. He was levelheaded. Just an all-around cool demeanor. This doesnât add up.â Perkinsâ family disputed any claim that he owed money on his car, saying they âfound financial receipts provingâ he was not at risk of âbeing in an active status of repossessionâ and that âmonthly payments were processed through his financing company.â CNNâs Cara Lynn Clarkson, Nick Valencia and Maxime Tamsett contributed to this report.

Takemaru taught Japanese studies, according to herÂ faculty pageÂ on UNLVâs website. While she faced multiple challenges and physical disabilities, Takemaru was described by her colleague, associate professor Margaret Harp, as a âtriple-threat artist.â She was a professional concert pianist, embroidered and enjoyed making homemade chocolates, Harp said during a news conference Friday. Takemaru was also a cat lover who covered her office in photos, drawings and calendars of cats. âNaoko was frail physically, however, she was lionhearted in kindness, lionhearted in generosity, lionhearted in humanity, the point of liberal arts, and I have no doubt she was lionhearted in her final moments on earth,â Harp said. UNLV will forego in-person finals in the wake of the fatal shooting but will hold winter commencement as planned. âGiven the physical and emotional trauma that the university community has endured, and because of the impact to campus facilities, we have decided that faculty and staff should continue to work remotely through the end of the calendar year,â university President Keith Whitfield saidÂ in a post. Whitfield said the university will âprovide flexibility for faculty and instructors â as well as students â to bring this semester to a positive endâ by ending the semester with the grades earned through work completed before the shooting. Some professors may elect to hold optional online finals or arrange for take-home projects. Winter commencement will proceed in person as planned on December 19 for undergraduates and December 20 for those receiving masterâs and doctoral degrees.

About three dozen 911 calls were released from the shooting, most from those in the Lee Business School where the shooting took place. Others were placed by people fleeing the scene as well as distraught family members relaying information sent via text by loved ones at the scene. Many callers reported hearing âa lot of shots,â and then âscreaming.â The calls included one from a woman who was crying and hiding under the desk in her office as she described hearing gunshots followed by screaming. Officers entered Beam Hall â which lacks interior cameras, the sheriff said â with the first officer arriving within 78 seconds of the first 911 call, said Adam Garcia of University Police Services.

They were identified as Detective Nathanial Drum and Officer Damian Garcia, Chief Garcia said. Drum has worked for the department since 2017 and is assigned to the detective bureau, while Garcia has worked for the agency since 2018 and is assigned to the special events division as well as the detective bureau, the chief added. âIn a word, these two officers are heroes. They kept the worst from becoming a bloodbath,â Garcia said. âThe collective response in actions of our other initial responding officers, UPD, Metro or many regional agencies no doubt saved lives as well.Â Their swift response and exceptional courage were pivotal in neutralizing this threat and undoubtedly prevented further harm for our community.â The two men have been put on administrative leave pending an investigation, as is standard procedure during officer-involved shootings, Garcia said.

The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said 24-year-old Brandon Daleshaun Keys of Maplewood was the man shot by police yesterday afternoon. Keys was taken to Regions Hospital for treatment and died of a gunshot wound to the head early Friday morning. Michael Tschida was identified as the officer who shot Keys. Tschida was shot in the leg and was also taken to Regions Hospital for treatment and was released. Tschida, a 14-year law enforcement veteran, is now on administrative leave â a standard practice for officers involved in BCA use-of-force investigations. According to information gathered by the BCA so far, a woman called police to report a order for protection violation. She said she was driving with another man in her passenger seat when Keys pulled up behind her vehicle and began hitting it from behind with his own. She said Keys had a gun. The woman stopped at the intersection of North Cretin and Marshall Avenues, blocks from the University of St. Thomas, and Keys left his car to approach her vehicle. Tschida then arrived and told Keys to get on the ground. That's when BCA officials said the two exchanged gunfire. The woman and her passenger were not injured. Investigators recovered a handgun from the scene and say they are canvassing the area for witnesses, video footage and other clues to determine what happened. Tschida's body-worn-camera also captured the incident, but it's unclear if or when that will be made public. Dozens of St. Paul squad cars responded to yesterday's shooting, cordoning off blocks around the crime scene to recover evidence. Keys was due in Hennepin County District Court next Monday for a hearing in connection with a two-year order for protection secured in October by a 38-year-old woman who shares a 5-year-old child with him, according to court records. It's unclear whether she is the same woman involved in Thursday's incident. The Minneapolis woman's petition for protection alleged that Keys kept her captive in her home on Oct. 19 for 4 Â½ hours while swearing and yelling at her. ""I tried to leave, but he wouldn't let me,"" she wrote in the petition. She also had an order for protection taken out in 2018, when she alleged that Keys gave her a black eye and bruises. ""[He] has a history of beating me physically,"" she wrote. The woman added that he stalked her over the phone and kept driving by her workplace. ""He called back to back so much, I had to turn my phone off."" Keys has been convicted twice for misdemeanor domestic abuse, both times for violating an order for protection involving the same woman, court records show. One violation occurred when he broke into the woman's home in St. Cloud, caused property damage and stole items. The second violation occurred when Keys was with the woman at a county government office. That woman and Keys' parents could not be reached for comment. Tschida was one of four St. Paul police officers who fired in the killing of Jaffort Demont Smith. Police shot Smith about 3:30 a.m. May 9, 2016, in the 700 block of Buffalo Street after he fired on them and ignored repeated orders to drop his weapon following an encounter outside a towing company. Smith also had shot and wounded a 49-year-old woman with him who eventually lost her eye. A grand jury ultimately issued no charges against the officers involved. Last year Smith's family sued the officers and the city of St. Paul in federal court, alleging Smith's civil rights were violated. That lawsuit is still pending after a settlement was not reached during a conference Dec. 1. According to a Star Tribune database, at least 230 people have been killed in Minnesota during encounters with law enforcement. Star Tribune staff writer Katie Galioto contributed to this report."

Samuel Paty, a history and geography teacher, was killed near his school after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. Attacker Abdoullakh Anzorov, a young Chechen who had become radicalized, was killed by police. The court found five of the defendants, who were 14 and 15 at the time of the attack, guilty of involvement in staking out the teacher and identifying him for the attacker. The sixth defendant, 13 at the time, was found guilty of lying about the classroom debate in a comment that aggravated online anger against the teacher. After the ruling, the six defendants left the courtroom without speaking. Some had their heads down as they listened to the verdict. One appeared to wipe tears. The teenagers â all students at Patyâs school â acknowledged wrongdoing, and testified that they didnât know the teacher would be killed. One was given a six-month prison term but allowed to serve it under house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The others were given special suspended sentences of between two and three years requiring them to stay in school or jobs and attend regular medical meetings. The sentences included special educative follow-up measures that also involved their families. Lawyers for Patyâs family decried the sentences as too lenient. Lawyers for the teenagers expressed relief. Patyâs name was disclosed on social media after the class debate, during which he showed caricatures of Islam’s prophet published by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The publication had triggered a deadly extremist massacre in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom in 2015. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims in France and around the world, who see them as sacrilegious. But Paty’s killing reinforced the French stateâs commitment to freedom of expression, and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. The five who identified Paty to the attacker were convicted of involvement in a group preparing aggravated violence. The sixth defendant wrongly claimed that Paty had asked Muslim students to raise their hands and leave the classroom before he showed the class the cartoons. She was not in the classroom that day, and later told investigators she had lied. She was convicted of making false allegations. Her lawyer Mbeko Tebula said she ââdoesnât forgive herself for this lie.ââ ââShe didnât imagine it would â¦ turn into so much horror,ââ he said. ââShe was 13.ââ âShe will try to move forward,â he said. “She will try to rebuild herself as a woman. To live with this permanent guilt, which will not pass through her but will inhabit her.ââ The girl’s father shared the lie in an online video that called for mobilization against the teacher. Now incarcerated, her father and a radical Islamic activist who helped disseminate virulent messages against Paty are among eight adults who will face a separate trial for adults suspected of involvement in the killing, expected late next year. Lawyer Virginie Le Roy, representing Patyâs family, had tears in her eyes as she described her anger that the punishment was not tougher. ââYes, I am emotional. I am emotional for this family, also for the memory of Samuel. A man decapitated in the street is not nothing. We are in France. This was in 2020,ââ she said. The sentences are “a bad signal to the family of Samuel, a bad signal to the students, and a bad signal to teachers.ââ Teachers at the school and Paty’s relatives were in the courtroom along with some of the defendantsâ parents. Family members of the teenagers comforted each other afterward, some looking depleted or resigned. They refused to speak to reporters. The media are not allowed to disclose the defendants’ identities, according to the French law regarding minors. The proceedings come weeks after a teacher was fatally stabbed and three other people were injured in northern France in October, in a school attack by a former student suspected of Islamic radicalization. That killing occurred in a context of global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and led French authorities to deploy 7,000 additional soldiers across the country to bolster security and vigilance."

SDPD officials said the incident happened at around 11:30 pm Thursday night at the 4S Commons Town Center near Craftsman Way. Both the sergeant and suspect involved were transported to the hospital, and ABC 10News learned the suspect later died DPD Chief David Nisleit told the media early Friday morning that the sergeant was in serious but stable condition after sustaining at least one gunshot wound to the upper body. The sergeant was slated to undergo surgery later in the morning, the chief said. Police said the sergeant ""was expected to survive."" According to Nisleit, the sergeant initially made contact with the individual inside one of the stores at the shopping center, which led them to the outside of the store. ""This is a very dangerous situation; multiple rounds being fired at officers. The officers did a phenomenal job tonight,"" Nisleit said. ""Obviously, we have a sergeant in the hospital, that makes me emotional. But the officers did an amazing job tonight."" The chief said this is the third officer shot in the line of duty in the last 12 months. When asked about that, Nisleit gave a long and impassioned response. ""This goes back to not holding criminals accountable. And victims of violent crimes losing their voice. And it puts law enforcement in this position where the authority, the narrative about law enforcement creates an environment that's dangerous. Even more dangerous. And if you have a suspect that's willing to shoot at police, they're willing to shoot at anybody. So you have somebody that openly fires on police officers, again this is my third officer that's been hit in the last 12 months ,and I've had multiple officers shot at. Yes, we're a large city, but we've not seen this kind of violence towards law enforcement in my 35-year career that I can remember. And you can tell I'm kind of fed up with it, to be honest with you. And a lot of it is because criminals are no longer being held accountable. And it's gotta stop."" Police said the sergeant has been with the department for several years and has served with the SWAT unit. Per San Diego County protocols for law enforcement officer-involved shootings, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department Homicide Unit will lead the investigation into the incident.

The Illinois Policy Institute found that in Chicago, neighborhoods with more single-parent headed households face 226% higher violent crime rates and 436% higher homicide rates. In cities across America, and on the streets of Chicago, the report finds public safety is greater in communities where the two-parent family is the dominant norm. During a recent panel discussion, Rafael Mangual, a member of the Council on Criminal Justice, said the 2022 police shooting of a 13-year-old Black teen during a foot pursuit in Chicago has changed the landscape. “The protests that ensued in the wake of that shooting led to real policy shifts on the ground where now Chicago police pursuit policies are different and foot pursuits and vehicle pursuits are significantly less likely to happen, and that changes the dynamics on the street,” said Mangual. Crime has been a highly debated issue in the Chicago area and most likely will be a hot button topic during next year’s election. Gov. J.B. Pritzker recently told Crain’s Chicago Business that violent crime has been coming down in Chicago for the past three years. However, according to Chicago Police Department statistics, over the past four years murders have increased 23% and the number of shooting incidents increased 16%. Mangual said the Black Lives Matter movement has had an impact on how police deal with crime, which has led to consequences. “The protests not only zapped morale, but they drove an enormous amount of policy shifts,” said Mangual. “Those policy shifts created the conditions for the crime increases.” According to the Illinois Policy Institute, Chicago Police Department arrest rates were the lowest in a decade last year. Less than 12% of the more than 238,000 crime reports resulted in arrests. The Illinois State Police provide a public website to view crime statistics in Illinois. The “Crime in Illinois Online” website is part of the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which serves as the state’s digital storage for crime statistics to provide information for use in law enforcement."

The document also revealed the suspect had “minimal involvement in the Austin area.” The suspect was identified by the Austin Police Department as Shane James, 34. Travis County Jail records show he booked into the jail at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday and charged with capital murder of multiple people. James is due in court on Jan. 18, court records show. Police responded at 6:49 p.m. Tuesday to a burglary call in the 5300 block of Austral Loop, which is in southwest Austin. According to an affidavit, the caller reported that he was “viewing a live feed of his surveillance system” and saw a man actively breaking into his home where his wife and special needs daughter were at the time. When officers got there they saw the suspect was in the house and trying to flee out of the back of the house, the affidavit said. That’s when James shot at an officer and the officer was hit multiple times. According to APD, the officer shot back but the suspect was not hit. APD Interim Chief Robin Henderson said the officer is in stable condition. Furthermore, police said the officer was released from the hospital and recovering from his injuries. Due to the investigation involving an officer in the shooting, police said it would release more details within 10 business days, per APD protocol. Police found two victims inside the home, who were pronounced dead on the scene. APD identified the two victims as Katherine Short, 56, and Lauren Short, 30. Life-saving measures were performed but unsuccessful, the affidavit noted. According to the affidavit, James stole a car from the garage of the home on Austral Loop and drove away. The suspect was chased by police until he crashed at the intersection of State Highway 45 and FM 1826. The affidavit said during the chase, speeds reached up to 90 mph before James hit another car and crashed. KXAN has reached out to multiple agencies on details surrounding the crash but we have not yet obtained a crash report. Officers took James into custody and found a pistol in his waistband, the affidavit stated. The affidavit said after James was identified, “it was found he had minimal involvement with the Austin, Texas area.” James had an address in San Antonio, and APD requested the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office to check the residence for any injured people, according to the affidavit. BCSO went to the residence and located two people “deceased with obvious trauma to their bodies,” the affidavit said. They were later identified by BCSO as James’ parents. Shane is connected to multiple homicides and aggravated assaults in Austin and Bexar County Tuesday, Dec. 5. The affidavit said documents charging Shane with other crimes will be produced in separate affidavits."

Fahren James alleges she was badly injured when she was shot by officers multiple times with so-called “less-lethal” projectiles on May 30, 2020, outside CBS Studios, when citizens were protesting the killing of Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police five days earlier, according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court. Attorneys representing the defendants had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit James filed in 2021, arguing that the protest was unlawful and the officers actions were not intended to stifle free speech. They also argued that they did not use excessive force on James, and that the doctrine of qualified immunity shielded the officers from civil action, among other claims. U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall reviewed officers’ body-worn camera footage, and evidence and argument presented by the plaintiff’s attorney before issuing her decision Tuesday. The judge determined that a reasonable jury could find James’ act of protesting was a substantial motivating factor in the officers’ conduct. “Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to (James), a reasonable jury could conclude that (her) act of protesting at an anti-police rally was a substantial factor that motivated the defendant officers’ conduct,” Marshall wrote. The lawsuit alleges First and Fourth Amendment violations made by LAPD, including excessive force and retaliation against peaceful protestors. “This decision, allowing Ms. James’ case to proceed, is a beacon of hope for the protection of free speech and against police brutality,” James’ attorney V. James DeSimone said in a statement. “The court recognized the gravity of the allegations and the importance of allowing a jury to hear Ms. James’ story. This is a step forward in our relentless pursuit of justice and ensuring the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters is respected.”"

According to previous reports, 35-year-old Darcel Edwards was shot in the early morning hours of Oct. 24 by Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Officer Gunnar Gossett in the area of E 25th St. and Columbia Ave. In the footage provided by IMPD, which is edited, the body camera worn by an officer showed a traffic stop conducted in the area of E. 25th St. and Park Ave. around 4:20 a.m. on Oct. 24. A man, later identified as Edwards, was pulled over for driving at a high rate of speed. When he was pulled over, Edwards exited his vehicle and told the officer about another vehicle hitting his car. The officer told Edwards not to reenter his vehicle. However, the footage shows that Edwards got back into his vehicle and fled from the stop. The vehicle was located crashed near the corner of E 25th St. and Columbia Ave. The video shows Edwards running in a nearby backyard and officers later located him in a nearby tree. While in the tree, multiple IMPD officers told Edwards to get out of the tree, and one of the officers told him to “show his f—— hands.” Edwards refused and asked police to call his mother. Edwards told the officers on scene multiple times that he had epilepsy and that he had seizures. As officers continued to ask Edwards to get out of the tree, the video shows Edwards telling officers that he could not get out of the tree, continuing to ask officers to call his mom. “I’m coming down, but I feel like I’m coming into a seize man,” Edwards said, to which officers responded, “Well, you might not want to do it up there. Get down and we’ll get you the help you need.” Edwards asked the officers to help him, to which officers told him that a medic would be provided if he came down. When Edwards told officers he would wait in the tree until the medic comes, officers continued to demand that he come down from the tree. In response to this, the video shows Edwards telling officers: “well, shoot me with the taser then.” When officers told Edwards that it was a pistol, Edwards responded “whatever it is, hit me with it.” An officer on scene told Edwards that he has to have a reason to discharge his weapon, warning Edwards “do not give me one.” “I don’t have anything on me,” Edwards said, to which the officer responded “I don’t believe you.” An argument between the officers and Edwards continues as Edwards seems to reach for something in the tree. An officer at the scene warns if Edwards reaches for something again, he will be shot. “Get down,” the officer said. Edwards responded “Kill me” to which the officer said “No.” This exchange happened a few times. When Edwards seemingly reaches for something in his pocket, Gossett discharged his weapon twice toward the tree which seem to hit Edwards. Officials said Edwards was transported to a local hospital in critical condition and died two days later. At the scene, officials found a holster, but a gun was not found. According to previous reports, crews took down the tree where Edwards was and investigators raked the underbrush in the search of a firearm."

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that Brandon Daleshaun Keys, 24, of Maplewood, died of a gunshot wound to the head early Friday morning. Police allege Keys had been involved in an exchange of fire with St. Paul Officer Michael Tschida, who suffered a gunshot wound to the leg near the intersection of Cretin and Marshall Avenues in the Merriam Park neighborhood. The BCA says Tschida is a 14-year law enforcement veteran, and has been placed on standard administrative leave. In a statement, the BCA said St. Paul PD has received reports of an order for protection violation, with a woman reporting ""she was driving with a man in her passenger seat when Keys pulled in behind her and started hitting her vehicle with his."" The woman told police that Keys was armed, and that when she stopped at Cretin and Marshall he got out of his car and approached her vehicle. Per law enforcement, Tschida arrived at the scene, got out of his squad car and ordered Keys on the ground. ""The two exchanged gunfire, during which Keys was struck in the head and Tschida was struck in the leg. Both were taken to Regions Hospital for treatment, where Keys later died,"" the statement says. Tschida has since been treated for his injury and release from Regions. Neither the woman who called 911 or the passenger in her vehicle were hurt. The BCA says there were ""numerous witnesses to this incident,"" which was also captured on a number of cameras including Tschida's body-worn camera. A handgun was recovered from the scene.

On Friday, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department released a Critical Incident Video that included edited body-worn camera footage and security video from an Oct. 26 incident where a man was shot and killed after firing at an officer’s leg with an IMPD-issued gun. The incident, IMPD said at the time, began around 5:50 p.m. after officers were called to the intersection of E. 21 Street and N. Shadeland Avenue on Indy’s east side for a trespassing investigation. Per previous reporting, IMPD said an officer saw a man he recognized as 37-year-old Frederick Davis trespassing at a nearby business called The Rodeway Inn. In the video released Friday, the IMPD officer can be seen telling Davis to put his hands on a squad car. Instead, Davis can be seen walking away and arguing with the officer before the officer chases the suspect off the Rodeway Inn property. Davis then is seen running on foot into the street and the officer does not pursue him on foot. IMPD said officers then began searching for Davis, who reportedly was banned from several businesses in the area. Around this time, according to police, an employee of a nearby Burger King flagged down officers and said the man they were looking for was inside the restaurant. In the edited bodycam footage released Friday, Officer Nicolas Deem and a fellow officer are seen entering the Burger King and immediately finding Davis near the bathrooms. The video shows that while trying to arrest Davis, a struggle ensued and all three men fell to the ground. It is around this time that IMPD says Davis was able to gain control of Ofc. Deem’s service weapon and shot the officer in the right leg. While Davis cannot clearly be seen firing the gun in the bodycam footage, a fired shot can be heard just after the suspect says “I’m about to die.” Furthermore, a section of IMPD’s Critical Incident Video pauses and highlights moments of bodycam and security footage where Davis is seen grabbing and holding the officer’s weapon after firing. That can be seen below: Bodycam footage then shows Ofc. Deem reach for his backup service weapon and fire four consecutive shots at Davis, striking the suspect. Davis is then seen running out of the restaurant before tripping and falling in the parking lot as the second IMPD officer chases him. The second officer can then be heard radio signaling that a “police action shooting” has occurred before rolling Davis onto his stomach and handcuffing him. Soon after this, Ofc. Deem is shown standing up, grabbing his firearm from the floor of the restaurant and running outside. He can later be heard requesting medics for himself and Davis and then asking the Burger King employees standing outside if they were okay. IMPD says officers then provided Davis with medical aid until IEMS showed up and took him to Eskenazi Hospital, where he later died. While Ofc. Deem can be heard downplaying his gunshot wound as a graze wound in bodycam footage, IMPD later said he suffered injuries more significant than previously thought. Ofc. Deem, according to the department, has significant bullet fragments in his leg with some fragments expected to stay in his leg forever. No other officers or uninvolved citizens were injured in the incident. As a result of the shooting, both IMPD’s Critical Incident Response Team and IMPD Internal Affairs opened separate investigations. Ofc. Deems has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure whenever an officer-involved shooting investigation is underway. The civilian majority Use of Force Review Board will hold a mandatory hearing when the criminal process is finalized, IMPD said.

Teacher Samuel Paty was killed outside his school in 2020 after showing his class cartoons of the prophet of Islam during a debate on free expression. The attacker, a young Chechen who had radicalized, was killed by police. The court found five of the defendants, 14 and 15 at the time of the attack, guilty of staking out the teacher and identifying him for the attacker. Another defendant, 13 at the time, was accused of lying about the classroom debate in a comment that aggravated online anger against the teacher. All were handed brief or suspended prison terms. The teenagers testified that they didnât know the teacher would be killed. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. APâs earlier story follows below. PARIS (AP) - A French juvenile court is handing down a verdict Friday for six teenagers accused of involvement in the killing of teacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded by an Islamic extremist after he showed caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad to his class for a debate on freedom of expression. Paty, a history and geography teacher, was killed on Oct. 16, 2020, near his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin who had become radicalized. The attacker, Abdoullakh Anzorov, was then shot dead by police. Patyâs name was disclosed on social media after a class debate on free expression during which he showed prophet caricatures published by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The publication had triggered a deadly extremist massacre in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom in 2015. All those on trial were students at Patyâs school. If convicted, they face up to two-and-a-half years in prison. Five of the defendants, who were 14 or 15 at the time of the attack, are accused of staking Paty out until he left school that day and identifying him for the attacker in exchange for promises of 300-350 euros ($350-400). Investigators found that the attacker wanted to target Paty but didnât have the means to identify him. The five are facing charges of criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing aggravated violence. The sixth defendant, who was 13 at the time, is accused of wrongly claiming that Paty had asked Muslim students to raise their hands and leave the classroom before he showed the class the prophet cartoons. She was not in the classroom that day, and later told investigators she had lied. She is facing a charge of making false allegations. Her father shared the lie in an online video that called for mobilization against the teacher. He and a radical Islamic activist who helped disseminate virulent messages against Paty are among eight adults who will face a separate trial for adults suspected of involvement in the killing, expected late next year. In sometimes tearful testimony, the teenagers on trial said they had no idea the teacher would be killed, according to French media reports. The trial has been held behind closed doors, and the media are not allowed to disclose the defendants’ identities according to French law regarding minors. The proceedings come weeks after a teacher was fatally stabbed and three other people injured in northern France in October in a school attack by a former student suspected of Islamic radicalization. That killing occurred in a context of global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and led French authorities to deploy 7,000 additional soldiers across the country to bolster security and vigilance.

(WNCT) — The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is investigating an officer-involved shooting that resulted in the death of a fugitive who was wanted on multiple felony warrants. The incident happened in New Bern on Friday morning, according to the United States Marshals Service. Officials with the Carolinas Regional Fugitive Task Force were involved in the shooting while serving the warrants. The New Bern Police Department, which was providing support, said in a memo the incident happened at 709 Broad Street. The 700 block of Broad Street was closed down at 7:20 a.m. for about 40 minutes after the shooting. The U.S. Marshals Service said in a press release that during the attempted arrest, “the fugitive produced a firearm, and the task force fired, striking the fugitive.” Life-saving measures were attempted and EMS soon arrived to transport the person, whose name has not been released, to CarolinaEast Medical Center. He was pronounced dead there. Officials said no law enforcement officer injuries occurred. The U.S. Marshals Service will also conduct an internal review after the SBI completes its investigation."

Around 4 that morning, an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer patrolling near East 25th Street and Park Avenue heard gunshots and saw a vehicle speed away. The officer followed the vehicle and pulled it over on East 25th Street. Video from the officer’s body camera shows Edwards, getting out of a sedan with his hands up. Edwards places his hands on the trunk and says something about someone hitting his car. The officer asks Edwards who hit his car and tells him not to get back inside the vehicle. Edwards ignores the command, gets back behind the wheel, and heads east on 25th Street. A few minutes later, the officer found Edwards’ car crashed on the northeast corner of East 25th Street and Columbia Avenue, just west of Dr. Andrew J. Brown Avenue. The officer approached the vehicle but Edwards was not inside. Moments later, according to IMPD, Edwards “emerged from the driveway of a nearby home and ran into a backyard.” Several other IMPD officers arrived at the scene and joined in the search. Less than five minutes later, Edwards was found hiding in a tree. In the video from Officer No. 2’s body camera, that officer can be heard yelling, “Show me your hands! Show me your hands! Show me your hands and get down!” Edwards, hidden by tree branches, yells back that he has epilepsy and can’t get down. The body-worn camera of Patrol Officer Gunnar Gossett shows Gossett pointing his firearm at the tree and ordering him to come down. Again, Edwards refuses and tells officers to tase or shoot him. IMPD says Edwards tried to reach for his pocket, but the motion is somewhat obscured by tree branches. Officers yell at Edwards to stop reaching and Patrol Officer Gossett warns him, “If you do it again, you will be shot. Do you understand? I’m telling you right now, if you reach for something again, you will be shot.” Edwards yells back, “Kill me!” to which an officer responds, “No!” Edwards orders the officers again to kill him, and an officer again tells him no. The officers warn him again not to reach before Gossett fires two shots into the tree. Once Edwards is on the ground, video from Gossett’s body camera shows the officers giving him first aid. He was transported to a local hospital in critical condition and died two days later. IMPD says officers found a gun holster in Edwards’ waistband but a firearm was never located. The Oct. 24 shooting was the 13th police shooting of 2023. Several others have occurred since then, including one on the day Edwards died. The shooting is being investigated by the IMPD Critical Incident Response Team and the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office. A separate and independent investigation by IMPDâs Internal Affairs Unit will ensure that department policy is followed, the department says. The fatal shooting will be reviewed by the civilian-majority use of force review board. The review will take place after the criminal investigation is complete.

The shooting happened just after 2 p.m. at the busy intersection of Marshall and Cretin avenues in the city's Merriam Park neighborhood, just north of the University of St. Thomas. Neither the officer nor the alleged suspect involved in the incident have been publicly identified. At a press briefing Thursday evening, St. Paul Police Sgt. Mike Ernster said preliminary information indicates the officer confronted the man while investigating an alleged restraining order violation. A woman had called 911 to report the violation, telling dispatch a man with a handgun was following her in her vehicle and intentionally driving his vehicle into hers and damaging it, Ernster said. When police arrived in the area and confronted the suspect, he fired at officers with his handgun, Ernster said. One officer was struck in the lower leg. ""Our officer returned fire, striking the man and critically injuring him,"" Ernster said. Both the officer and the suspect were taken to Regions Hospital. As of Thursday evening, the officer had been treated and released and the suspect remains hospitalized with life-threatening injuries.

As he rode, he held another bike in tow alongside him. He was also in possession of a replica handgun, which the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office said he used to protect himself on the streets. On that same day, police said they received a report of a stolen bicycle. Officers said they wanted to stop Corvera to question him. What ensued resulted in a street being blocked off, multiple San Francisco police units arriving — his attorney estimated nearly 80 officers– the appearance of two military-grade armored vehicles, and Corvera being shot at approximately 15 times from four different officers, including one shot that nearly missed his head, his attorney said. Corvera was never charged with being in possession of a stolen bike. Instead, he was charged with resisting arrest, brandishing a replica firearm and interfering with the lawful performance of a police officer. His trial began in early November, but ended in a hung jury, leading the public defender’s office to argue — not for the first time — that Corvera should never have been approached in the first place. The office said some jurors told them that they felt police had confronted their client for racially motivated reasons. Now the public defender’s office has filed a Racial Justice Act claim in Corvera’s case. RJA claims are based on a state law that went into effect in 2021 that allows defendants to raise issues of bias in their cases based on race, ethnicity or national origin. “Mr. Corvera was unjustly singled out by the police based on racial stereotypes of Latinx people, of the unhoused, and of their rights to possess things like bikes,” said attorney Kathleen Natividad in a statement released by the public defender’s office Wednesday. On Thursday, police spokesperson Sgt. Kathryn Winters said that the public defender’s office is entitled to mount whatever defense they deem appropriate for their client. “It is up to the courts to determine if the defense has merit,” wrote Winters in an email. “The merits of their claim will be argued in court. As for this case, there is a parallel administrative investigation that will examine the officers actions and determine whether they were in policy from the stop through the officer involved shooting.” Winters declined to comment further on the case or whether officers approached Corvera out of bias. “Because of the pending criminal trial and the pending administrative investigation, we will not speak to the veracity of Mr. Corvera’s defense, as it would be inappropriate for us to make public statements that could result in claims that conditions exist that prevent a fair trial for the defendant,” she said. San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott held a town hall soon after the shooting, as he does with any officer-involved shootings. The department played body-worn camera images of the encounter that showed the gradual buildup of police the morning of Aug. 6, 2022. According to Cmdr. Paul Yep, Corvera was pursued onto Shotwell Street and an officer reported seeing a gun in his hand. Corvera can be seen holding what looked like a gun in the footage. Corvera crouched down behind a car and pointed the replica firearm at the officers, who in turn pulled out their weapons. Audio of Corvera can be heard, with him yelling, “Get out of here!” and, “I don’t need no help.” Police discharged their firearms, but no one was hurt. Eventually Corvera tossed his fake gun into the street. Police allege his gun then fired, but there is no sound on the audio to confirm this, except for an officer saying, “It went off when he threw it.” At the time of the town hall, the public defender’s office said the stop by police had “instigated and escalated a situation which endangered the public, Mr. Corvera, and members of the SFPD.” The RJA hearing is set for Dec. 13. and due to the mistrial, prosecutors are pursuing another trial that is scheduled to begin Dec. 29. Public Defender Mano Raju on Wednesday urged the District Attorney’s Office to drop the case. The District Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment.

The indictment Thursday includes three felonies and six misdemeanors. Special counsel David Weiss says Hunter Biden âspent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills.â Defense attorney Abbe Lowell argues prosecutors bowed to political pressure in the case, which had been expected to end with a plea deal before it imploded over the summer. The new charges are in addition to federal firearms charges in Delaware alleging Hunter Biden broke laws against drug users having guns in 2018. BAGHDAD (AP) â U.S. and Iraqi officials say a rocket attack at the sprawling U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has caused minor damage but no casualties. Iran-backed militias in Iraq have claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks that targeted bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria since the Israel-Hamas war began two months ago. The embassy is in the heavily fortified Green Zone of Iraq's capital. An Iraqi security official said 14 Katyusha rockets were fired on Friday, of which some struck near one of the U.S. Embassyâs gates.

Jamaal Bowman for triggering a fire alarm in a U.S. Capitol office building when the chamber was in session. The New York congressman Thursday became the third Democrat in the House to be admonished this year through the process.Â âCensure me next. Thatâs how worthless your effort is,â Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the floor late Wednesday. âIt has no credibility. No integrity. No legitimacy. Censure me next, and Iâll take that censure and Iâll wear it next week, next month, next year like a badge of honor.âÂ The vote is the latest example of how the chamber has begun to deploy punishments like censure, long viewed as a punishment of last resort, routinely and often in strikingly partisan ways.

WASHINGTON (AP) â The Biden administration is putting pharmaceutical companies on notice. Washington is warning them that if the price of certain drugs is too high, the government might cancel their patent protection and allow rivals to make their own versions. Under a plan announced Thursday, the government would consider overriding the patent for high-priced drugs that have been developed with the help of taxpayer money and letting competitors make them in hopes of driving down the cost. The administration did not immediately release details about how the process will work and how it will deem a drug costly enough to act. If the plan is enacted, drugmakers are almost certain to sue. AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â A Texas judge has given a pregnant woman whose fetus had a fatal diagnosis permission to get an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to the stateâs ban that took effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. It was unclear Thursday how quickly or whether Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, will be able to obtain an abortion. State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble has granted a temporary restraining order allowing Cox to have an abortion. The state has not said if it plans to appeal. Cox is 20 weeks pregnant. Her attorneys say Cox went to an emergency room this week for a fourth time during her pregnancy.

With the reopening of the world-famous Paris landmark drawing closer by the day, theyâre now beginning to picture their return to the place they call home. They are impatient to breathe life back into its restored stones and vast spaces with their songs and prayers. On Friday, Notre Dame's rebirth from the devastating fire will hit a major milestone. It will begin the last year of repair work before the cathedral reopens its huge doors to the public on Dec. 8, 2024. French President Emmanuel Macron will mark the 12-month countdown by donning a hard hat and touring the fenced-off reconstruction site. LONDON (AP) â Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in sometimes angry testimony to Britainâs inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic, on Thursday defended himself against suggestions that his indifference and failure to heed the advice of scientists led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. In a second day of sworn testimony, Johnson rejected claims that he was prepared to let older people die to protect the economy and that he was too slow to order a second national lockdown as infection rates began to rise in the autumn of 2020.

He was treated at Regions and released from the hospital Thursday. St. Paul police responded to a report of a violation of an order for protection, the BCA said of its preliminary investigation. A woman called 911 and reported a man she had an order for protection against was following her as she was driving, St. Paul police said Thursday night. She reported she was driving with a man in her passenger seat when Keys pulled behind her and starting hitting her vehicle with his, and she also told police that Keys had a gun, according to the BCA. The woman stopped at Cretin and Marshall avenues, and Keys got out of his car and approached the woman’s vehicle, the BCA said. Tschida arrived, exited his squad and ordered Keys to get on the ground. “The two exchanged gunfire, during which Keys was struck in the head and Tschida was struck in the leg,” the BCA said in Friday’s statement. Police said Thursday night that the man fired a handgun at the officer, striking him in the lower leg, and the officer returned fire. Keys died early Friday. BCA crime scene personnel found a handgun at the scene. The incident was captured on Tschida’s body-worn camera, along with other video cameras, the BCA said. The BCA said, when they complete the investigation, they will forward the findings to the Ramsey County attorney’s office for review. Recent order for protection granted A woman who was in a relationship with Keys until 2020 and had a 5-year-old child with him applied for an order for protection (OFP) in October, court records show. It wasn’t known Friday whether she was the woman who called 911 about Keys Thursday. The woman wrote in a court document that in October Keys wouldn’t let her leave for about 4½ hours. He unplugged the TV when she tried to ignore him, spit on the couch, yelled and swore at her, which made her “scared for my safety,” she wrote in a court document. He “made threats to do physical harm like, ‘You are lucky that I’m not the same person’” he once was, she wrote and noted that she previously had an OFP against him and she “knew what (Keys) is capable of doing.” The woman also wrote that Keys kept calling, driving by and coming to her work. A judge granted the protective order. A sheriff’s deputy tried to serve notice of the OFP to Keys at an address in Vadnais Heights, but the unit was vacant and mail to him was returned as undeliverable, according to court records. A hearing had been scheduled for Monday. When the woman obtained an OFP against Keys in 2018, she wrote he’d hit her in the face and previously “punched me down.” She also said he threatened her when she was pregnant. Keys was charged three times in 2019 with violating the order for protection — two of the cases were dismissed after he pleaded guilty and completed probation in March 2022, and another was dismissed when a prosecutor cited insufficient evidence to proceed. Officer’s background Tschida, who has 14 years of law enforcement experience, is on standard administrative leave. He’s previously been involved in shootings as a St. Paul officer. He and three other St. Paul officers fatally shot Jaffort Smith, 33, in 2016. The BCA said Smith shot and wounded a woman, and fired at officers. A grand jury determined the officers’ use of deadly force was justified. The police department gave Tschida a medal of valor, saying he’d “displayed great courage, teamwork and professionalism” in “a very dangerous and intense situation.” Smith’s mother filed a federal lawsuit against the city and the officers last year, saying Smith was “not a credible threat” and they’d used excessive force. The suit is ongoing. In 2015, Tschida was working security off-duty at Walmart when a man attempted to steal a wireless speaker and Tschida tried to question him. The man pointed a handgun at Tschida’s head and ran away, and Tschida ran after him and fired at him after the man pointed the gun at the officer a second time, according to state and federal charges. In 2013, Tschida tried to stop a vehicle that had a broken rear passenger window and the driver led police on a chase. The driver struck a parked car and, when he tried to exit the vehicle, police said he pointed a handgun at officers. Tschida and another officer shot and wounded the man in the leg. He turned out to be a murder suspect and was later convicted of murder. Tschida also received a medal of valor from the police department for his actions in that case."

Police have not released the name of the officer who fired. The man killed has since been identified as David Bonino, 39. Officers had been dispatched to the area of 7th and Grayson streets about 5:25 a.m. Nov. 6 for a report of three people breaking into vehicles. One suspect was detained at the scene, but Bonino, who was driving, and a woman fled in what turned out to be a stolen Ford Expedition. Officers attempted to stop the vehicle and blocked off the roadway as it headed into the surrounding streets. At one point in the video, the Expedition reappears on Grayson; it heads toward the blocked vehicle, reverses into a police vehicle that has approached from the rear, then swerves right onto a sidewalk occupied by two police officers, the suspect who had been detained, and an uninvolved pedestrian. One officer can be heard shouting out for the other officers to take cover when he sees the vehicle. He then shouts “245 (assault) on an officer! 245 on an officer!” and draws his gun as the Ford backs into the police car. As the SUV heads onto the sidewalk, the officer yells, “he’s trying to run us over!”. At that point, the officer who had been detaining the other suspect presses that suspect against a parked car, holding them both inches away from the passing Expedition, and fires a number of shots — at least six, as many as nine — at the SUV as it drives by. After the shooting, the Ford traveled forward, coming to a stop at the end of the block when it is pinned against a building by a police car. A woman inside the vehicle can be heard screaming as police begin attempting to remove Bonino and give him medical treatment. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died. Berkeley police Officer Jessica Perry said that because of the still ongoing investigations, including by the department and the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, no other information is being released at this time. She said the video and audio portions were released in the interests of transparency and so that the community could have as much information as possible when officers are involved in what she described as a critical incident.

The deadly encounter happened during a domestic call at a South End apartment complex. CMPD officials released more than 60 clips of body camera footage from all officers who responded to the scene that day on August 20, 2023, to an apartment on the third floor. Officers had received a frantic 911 call from a woman asking for Medic and police around 8 a.m. When CMPD officers arrived at the home with Medic, they knocked on the door, but there was no answer from inside. There were gunshots and officers then kicked down the door to get in. The first CMPD officer entered the bedroom where in the body cam video you can hear a woman screaming ‘help me.’ The suspect appears from behind a bookshelf with a gun. The CMPD officer is observed telling the suspect to put the gun down. The gun falls on the floor but the man then appears to be reaching toward it in the newly released video. The suspect is then seen physically lunging at the CMPD officer, knocking him to the floor. Another officer enters the room. He tries to push the suspect off the other officer. The suspect is observed with a knife in his hand and then proceeds to stab the second officer in the head. The CMPD officer who was under the suspect fired a single shot and struck the suspect. CMPD said two knives and two guns were recovered from the room. The suspect died from his injuries. CMPD Chief Johnny Jennings commended the quick actions of the CMPD officers saying in part, “They rose to their training, putting their lives in extreme danger for the sake of the protection of innocent life.” He went on to say, “Police officers are never able to predict the circumstances that they are about to encounter. This case highlights the dangers they face and how quickly a threat can present itself.” The CMPD officer who was stabbed in the head was able to make a full recovery."

Officers responded on Oct. 18 to the 11200 block of Cauthorne Road in Glen Allen, police said. At the scene, they found a 19-year-old American Paint horse named Jake that had been shot between the jaw and eye. Jake was taken to the Blue Ridge Equine Clinic in Charlottesville, where he underwent multiple surgeries to repair and reconstruct his sinus cavity and dental structures, police said. The horse is still receiving treatment at the clinic. A representative at the clinic declined to comment on his condition, citing medical privacy. Richmond police on Thursday announced they were investigating an officer-involved shooting that occurred Wednesday night in the Southside neighborhood. Hanover investigators and Chesterfield County police on Tuesday arrested Jacob Brady, 20, of Richmond, and Robert Kelley Jr., 18, of North Chesterfield, in two separate operations, police said.

(WAVY) — Dare County deputies and the family of Sylvester Demetrius Selby have different accounts as to what happened the night he was shot and killed by an officer in Manteo on Oct. 2. The discrepancies in the incident come after the family issued a lawsuit against the sheriff and officer involved. The daughter, Legacy Spencer, is suing Sheriff Doug Doughtie and Deputy Edward Glaser III, the lawsuit stating Selby was shot and killed after trying to receive medical assistance for a stab wound to the heart. The family is seeking $4 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages as well as attorney fees and other relief. The lawsuit states that Selby walked out of the house with a kitchen knife in one hand, in a “non-threatening manner,” and an apple in the other, and complied with officers. In previous WAVY coverage, deputies said that Selby came at them with a knife, and neither deputies nor family members originally mentioned a stabbing wound as described in the lawsuit. Deputies also said they were responding to a trespassing call, and not a medical assistance call. In the lawsuit, it states that the other deputy present, DuWayne Gibbs, gave Selby a verbal command to put the knife down, to which Selby responded, “OK.” “As he walked down the stairs, during that last step he stumbled over a bike as deputy Glaser shot him and then he shot him twice on the ground,” said Harry Daniels, attorney for the Selby family. The lawsuit doesn’t mention the knife leaving Selby’s hands until after he slowly walked down the steps, stumbled on the last step and tripped on a bicycle, where he was then shot by Glaser and landed on his back. The knife and apple was said to have been dislodged at that point. Selby tried to reposition himself, the lawsuit states, and continued despite Glaser ordering him multiple times to stop moving. After his hands and knees were on the ground, he was shot two more times, according to the lawsuit. “The video is clear that Mr. Selby was killed and shot unlawfully as he surrendered after being stabbed in the heart, the chest,” Daniels told 10 On Your Side, “This is as egregious as it comes. It was completely unjust, uncaused shooting. The video speaks for itself.” Daniels has not viewed the body camera video himself, but co-counsel Chantel Cherry-Lassiter has. “The main thing that I was looking at was the fact that Mr. Selby did not seem to be a threat to anyone at the time of the interaction,” Cherry-Lassiter said, “… and that he had a man standing there in medical distress and he was visibly bleeding from his shirt and blood was dripping down his pants, and you could see that and I was thinking this gentleman needs some medical assistance and that is not what happened.” The lawsuit states that at the time he was shot, Selby posed no threat to anyone. Selby’s Fourth Amendment right was violated by the use of “excessive force,” according to the lawsuit. “At the time Mr. Selby was shot and killed by Deputy Glaser,” the lawsuit states, “he posed no threat to law enforcement, others or himself.” Keep up to date with the latest news on WAVY.com."

The sergeant, with the department for about six years, was rushed to a hospital with a skull fracture and other injuries, police officials said. He was speaking with family when he went into surgery early Friday morning and is expected to survive. Heâs the third San Diego officer to be shot in the last 12 months. Police Chief David Nisleit told reporters in front of the hospital where the sergeant was being treated that the department is ready to support him through his recovery. âThe next step is just wrap our arms around him and make sure he has everything him and his family need,â Nisleit said. Thursdayâs incident began about 10 p.m. when someone reported a stolen vehicle and provided San Diego police with a description of the person who took the car, according to the Sheriffâs Department, which is investigating the incident. Police found the car about 11:30 p.m. at the 4S Commons Town Center on 4S Commons Drive near Rancho Bernardo Road, said sheriffâs homicide Lt. Joseph Jarjura. A Ralphâs grocery store in the center would have been the only business open, and the shooting occurred outside of it. Officers found the suspect inside of the store, and as police approached, he ran out and fired at least one shot at officers, officials said. A sergeant was struck in the head. That prompted the other officers to open fire, Jarjura said. The suspect was shot multiple times. The officer and the suspect were taken to different hospitals. The suspect died about 1 a.m. The officer was in serious condition but stable, according to Jarjura. Neither of their names were released. Police recovered a firearm on the ground next to the suspect after the shooting. Four San Diego police officers were present at the time of the shooting, Jarjura said. Footage of the incident was recorded on body-worn cameras. Jarjura said that at this early stage of the shooting, the motive and circumstances remained under investigation. After the incident, Nisleit praised the work of his officers. âYou know, this is a very dangerous situation â multiple rounds being fired at officers,â he told reporters. âThe officers did a phenomenal job tonight.â Nisleit also noted the increase in gun threats that San Diego officers have had to face this year. âYou have a suspect thatâs willing to shoot at law enforcement, theyâre willing to shoot at anybody,â he told reporters. âIâm quite fed up with it.â The last time a San Diego officer was shot was June 8, when the officer was shot in the arm during a pursuit in City Heights. And on Dec. 12, 2022, Officer Javier Hernandez was shot in the chest and arm while chasing a fleeing suspect in Mountain View. Department officials say officers have been threatened with guns, shot at or shot in eight incidents this year; thatâs more than the previous two years combined San Diego officers have faced more gun threats in 2023 than the previous two years combined, according to data maintained by the departmentâs homicide unit. âIâve worked in law enforcement for over 20 years, and I have never seen it so violent,â said Jared Wilson, president of the San Diego Police Officers Association. The union president added that incidents like what happened Thursday âonly strengthen our resolve to combat crimeâ and confront people who harm others. Since January, two officers have been shot, five officers have been shot at and three officers have been threatened with firearms. And in August, a suspect fatally shot a 4-year-old police dog named Sir. Thursdayâs incident is being investigated by the Sheriffâs Department per a countywide agreement that ensures no agency investigates its own police shootings. The latest news, as soon as it breaks.

Sheriff Kevin McMahill identified the suspect on Thursday during a press conference as Anthony James Polito, 67. McMahill said that Polito was a resident of nearby Henderson, Nevada, and applied “numerous” times for jobs with several higher education institutions in Nevada, and was denied each time. Polito was killed by police during a shootout on Wednesday. The sheriff said that Polito had a “list” of people he was “seeking” on the campuses, including faculty from Eastern Carolina, where he previously worked. ‘ACTIVE SHOOTER’ AT UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS WITH ‘MULTIPLE VICTIMS;’ SUSPECT DEAD Polito also mailed 22 letters to various university employees across the country with no return address, one of which had a white powdery substance inside, McMahill said. When Polito’s home was searched after the shooting, detectives found a chair with a downward-pointing arrow to a document similar to a will and testament. Police are still trying to determine a motive, McMahill said.Â Officials said that Polito used a Taurus 9 mm handgun purchased legally in 2022, adding that 11 magazines were with the individual when he came to campus.

Whitfield said Chang spent over 20 years at the university. The third victim isn’t being identified yet. McMahill said the individual injured in the shooting is in life-threatening condition. McMahill said at a press conference Wednesday that the first 911 calls were placed at 11:45 a.m. He said two police officers were treated for minor injuries from searching campus rooms and buildings. Two detectives who initially responded engaged the alleged shooter and fired their weapons, leaving the suspect dead."

Crowds of students ran for their lives after a gunman attacked the campus on Wednesday morning, killing three people and critically wounding a fourth.Â Police later identified the gunman as 67-year-old Anthony James Polito, a resident of nearby Henderson, Nevada. Authorities say Polito had applied for several jobs at various colleges and universities in Nevada but was rejected each time.Â Polito was killed by police during a shootout Wednesday.Â LAS VEGAS POLICE IDENTIFY SUSPECT, VICTIMS, IN UNLV SHOOTING THAT LEFT 3 DEAD AND ONE INJURED Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Thursday that Polito had a list of targets at the school and more than 150 rounds of ammunition. The list included faculty at his former place of employment in Eastern Carolina University in North Carolina. “None of the individuals on the target list became a victim,” McMahill said, adding that police have contacted everyone on the suspectâs list, except for one person who is on a flight. Polito also mailed 22 letters to various university employees across the country with no return address, one of which had a white powdery substance inside, McMahill said. When Polito’s home was searched after the shooting, detectives found a chair with a downward-pointing arrow to a document similar to a will and testament. Authorities also said Polito appeared to be struggling financially, as detectives found an eviction notice taped to the door of his apartment.Â ‘ACTIVE SHOOTER’ AT UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS WITH ‘MULTIPLE VICTIMS;’ SUSPECT DEAD Investigators have not yet announced a motive in the shooting. Terrified students and professors cowered in classrooms and offices as the gunman roamed the top three floors of UNLVâs five-story Lee Business School around lunchtime Wednesday. The horror began about 15 minutes after Polito arrived at UNLV in a 2007 Lexus at around 11:30 a.m., McMahill said. Police received the first reports of an active shooting at 11:45 a.m. Everything happened in about 10 minutes. Polito made his way through the building and killed three people: Patricia Navarro, an assistant professor at UNLV’s accounting department; Cha Jan Chang, a professor at the university’s business school; and a third unidentified victim. A fourth victim was injured and is in life-threatening condition, McMahill said.Â UNLV SHOOTING SUSPECT WAS PROFESSOR WHO HAD APPLIED FOR JOB: AP SOURCE Police stopped the attack at around 11:55 a.m., when two police detectives confronted Polito outside the building as he left the business school. The detectives fired their weapons at the alleged shooter, leaving the suspect dead.Â Officials said that Polito used a Taurus 9mm handgun, purchased legally in 2022, adding that 11 magazines were with the individual when he came to campus. UNLV is home to some 30,000 students. The sheriff said students had been gathered outside the building and in the student union to eat and play games during the attack. If police had not intervened and stopped the attacker, “it could have been countless additional lives taken,” McMahill said.Â It is unclear how long Polito has resided in the Las Vegas area. A statement from East Carolina University said he had resigned as a tenured professor there, The Associated Press reported. Paul Whittington, one of Polito’s former students, told The Associated Press in an interview that that Polito seemed obsessed with anonymous student reviews left at the end of each semester. He said that Polito told the class that he remembered the faces of students who gave him bad reviews and would express that he was sure who they were and where they sat, pointing at seats in the classroom.Â “He always talked about the negative feedback he got,” Whittington said, recalling his time in Polito’s intro to operations management class in 2014. “He didnât get a lot of it, but there would always be one student every semester, or at least one student every class, that would give a negative review. And he fixated on those.” Fox News Digital’s Adam Sabes and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

A French court has convicted six teenagers in connection with the 2020 beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty, whose murder shocked the country. In a decision on Friday, the court found five of the six defendants, aged 14 through 15 at the time of the attack, guilty of helping the attacker identify the teacher. The sixth defendant was found guilty of lying about the content of a classroom debate that sparked anger at the teacher, who showed students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad during a discussion about free expression. Most Muslims avoid depictions of prophets, considering them to be blasphemous. Paty was killed and decapitated outside of a school in a Paris suburb on October 16, 2020, by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin named Abdoullakh Anzorov. Five of the accused students were accused of staking out Paty as he left the school and pointing him out for Anzorov, who was shot and killed by police, in exchange for promises of 300-350 euros ($350-400). In emotional testimony, the teenagers protested that they did not know that Paty would be killed. They face prison sentences of up to two and a half years. The court found the sixth defendant guilty of false accusations and slanderous comments after it was established that she told her parents that Paty had asked Muslim students to exit the classroom before showing the cartoons. The court established that she was not in class on that day. The trial, which has been held behind closed doors and with media outlets barred from sharing the identity of the teenagers due to French laws regarding minors, has underscored contention in French society over topics such as âextremismâ, Islamophobia, and freedom of expression. The ruling comes several weeks after a teacher was fatally stabbed in northern France in a school attack by a young man. Muslims and migrants from the Arab world say they face widespread discrimination and racism in French society, and that French traditions of keeping religion out of public spaces have been wielded selectively to crack down on expressions of Muslim identity. Politicians in France, especially on the right, have frequently leaned into rhetoric that portrays Muslims and Arabs as violent and uncivilised. News, World, Education"

It was during lunch. It was not mandatory. But Sanders, UNLV’s dean of the Lee Business School, opted to attend the meeting at the nearby Tam Alumni Center just five minutes before it was to start. The decision may have saved his life. About 15 minutes after he walked out of Beam Hall, a shooter opened fire on the floor where Sanders had expected to spend his lunch break. “I left the building just before the shooter arrived, and it appears that his first stop was on the fourth floor,” Sanders said in a phone conversation Thursday afternoon. “I am grateful that, for whatever reason, I wasn’t in the path of gunshots. But at the same time, I am also feeling this guilt, that I could have been there and tried to protect my people.” A close call Two of the three victims killed were identified by the Clark County coroner’s office as Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64, a professor of management information systems at Lee Business School; and Patricia Navarro Velez, 39, an assistant professor in the accounting department. The third victim is also a faculty member, whose identity has not been released pending notification of next of kin. A fourth person injured in the shooting, who remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition, is a visiting professor. Sanders said he knew the victims through meetings when he joined UNLV and also through occasional interactions, but otherwise had limited communication. On Thursday, Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said a “target list” was found in the assailant’s apartment. The list included members of the faculties at UNLV and East Carolina University in North Carolina. Sanders said he met with a pair of investigators Wednesday night, but there was no mention of such a list. At about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, Sanders, who will mark his third anniversary at UNLV next month, met with College of Fine Arts Dean Nancy Uscher and College of Education Dean Danica Hays on the second-floor Albrecht Room in the Tam building. About a dozen people attended the session, which focused on a new online platform to share information about the university’s business building. “I had been invited the night before, and I immediately texted the person that scheduled it, ‘Why are we having this meeting at lunch? That’s the one free hour I get,’” Sanders said. “And he said, ‘Don’t worry, your development people are going to be here.’ It wasn’t until about 20 minutes before I needed to be there that I figured, what the heck, they have sandwiches, I’ll eat there.” Frantic texts At 11:51 a.m., as introductions were being made around the table, everyone in the room received the campuswide alert of a reported shooting. “The meeting stopped, and we all started looking out the window at all the sirens,” Sanders said. The dean repeatedly texted his executive assistant, whose office is in the same suite as his at Beam Hall, finally receiving a response at noon. “I asked her, ‘Can you tell me what the active shooter situation is in our building?” he said. “And she said, ‘They just tried to get in both my doors.’ ” Sanders then called her and could hear the fire alarm blaring in the background. “She said that she was barricaded in her office with three students, and she could hear gunfire and someone was trying to break down her door,” Sanders said. “I don’t know if they were checking the door or if they kicked it or turned the knob … But she heard shots, and they were very close.” Sanders was later interviewed by investigators at his home. “They told me that her staying inside, and then not responding to that knocking on the door, saved her life.” Sanders and members of the group at Tam Alumni Center walked out of the board room to the building’s circular stairway. “As we were standing, leaning on it, we heard five pops, ‘Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop,’ coming from about 200 or 300 yards away,” Sanders said, figuring this was the firefight in which law enforcement officers shot and killed the assailant. “We immediately went back into conference and shut the door and barricaded inside.” The group was in the boardroom, quiet, for about three hours. No explanation Sanders was asked if he considered he might have been targeted specifically in the act, as a top-level administrator. “I didn’t know who the individual was, but from what I understand he was a wanna-be faculty member,” Sanders said. “I don’t know where this started. I have surmised that it’s possible he wanted to take out the leadership. But it’s also possible he went up a stairwell and just started shooting. Who knows? “ Sanders does know the fast action of first responders prevented even an even deeper tragedy. “These officers ran in, immediately,” Sanders said. “There is no question that there would have been more carnage if they hadn’t reacted so fast.” John Katsilometes’ column runs daily in the A section.

(WSPA) – The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting Thursday night in Newberry County. The Newberry County Sheriff’s Office said 911 received a call after 9 p.m. from a resident on Little Egypt Road in the Whitmire section stating that an individual was in the yard beating on their home and firing a weapon. While the caller remained on the phone, deputies said the incident escalated when the individual attempted to break into the home. The caller told first responders the suspect was on their back porch trying to enter the door when deputies said the suspect shot in the home. Authorities said the caller was able to provide them with the suspect’s name and then stated that the individual had walked away to their residence located nearby. Once deputies arrived at the scene, they approached the suspect’s home and requested that the individual step outside. Authorities said the suspect approached the doorway armed with a rifle. Deputies asked the suspect to drop their weapon and the suspect pointed the weapon at a deputy. The deputy then discharged their weapon and shot the suspect. Whitmire Rescue Squad and Newberry County EMS responded to the scene and determined there were no vital signs. The Newberry County Coroner’s Office has not identified the individual at this time. The deputy involved in the shooting was not injured but has been placed on administrative leave according to the sheriff’s office. SLED was immediately requested due to policy to investigate the incident."

Val Barnes. This was the incident which sparked the investigation into Shane Matthew James Jr. before he was tied to six fatal shootings. Barnes was injured during the fire exchange outside the Austin school, but he survived the incident. ""I'm just glad it was me and not any of our kids,"" Barnes said in a statement released by the school district police department. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Original Story: After a relatively short stint in police custody at the Travis County Jail, the man accused of going on a violent shooting spree in San Antonio and Austin reportedly attempted to make a break for it. Early reports indicate Shane Matthew James Jr., who now faces two capital murder charges in Austin, attempted to shake officers while in a “multi-floor, secured building.” More For You James Jr. faces two capital murder charges in the Texas capital city, including a newly filed capital murder of multiple persons which popped up in the 147th state District Court Thursday, December 7. James is accused of murdering his parents, Shane Matthew James Sr. and Phyllis James, in their San Antonio-area home in Kirby on the city's Far Eastside before taking off to Austin where he allegedly continued a shooting spree that claimed four more lives and injured three others, including two police officers. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Kristen Dark, Travis County Sheriff’s Office's public information officer, confirmed with MySA that James Jr. attempted to flee his confines in Travis County shortly after his arrest on Wednesday, December 6. “On Wednesday, December 6, 2023, as a corrections officer was opening the door to the housing unit where Shane James was assigned, James pushed past that officer and ran into the hallway,” Dark told MySA. “Corrections officers detained him, and he resisted. He was ultimately restrained.” James Jr. seemingly had a slim chance of escaping even if he’d slipped past the initial line of officers as Dark said the Travis County Jail is a multi-floor, secure facility. “James would neither have been able to escape the floor he was on nor the building itself,” Dark said, noting no additional charges were filed for his short-lived attempt at fleeing. Advertisement Article continues below this ad The four victims believed to be fatally shot by James Jr. in Austin were named by Travis County officials over the past two days. The first two identified were Emmanuel Pop Ba, 32, and Sabrina Rahman, 24, who were fatally shot in the 7300 block of Shadywood Drive on Austin’s Southside. Both would have celebrated birthdays this month. On Thursday, December 7, the Austin Police Department identified the two shot to death in an Austin home in the 5300 block of Austral Loop as Catherine Short, 56, and Lauren Short, 30. Family members of one of the men fatally shot on the Southside of Austin, Ba, have created a GoFundMe account which raised nearly $15,000 in the two days since it was created. According to the post on the crowdfunding website, family of the deceased man are looking for help with the costs of sending his body back to Guatemala to be with the rest of his family. “No one expected this misfortune,” the post reads, calling Ba a humble man who left behind a wife and three children, including a boy and two girls. The GoFundMe post says Ba was having lunch in his car in front of a home he was working on when James Jr. reportedly shot him on Shadywood Drive.

Seavey, 27, as the man fatally shot Wednesday by a Portland police officer outside an RV parked in an industrial area and near a homeless encampment in Northeast Portland’s Sumner neighborhood. Court records indicate Seavey was from Washington. Police have not yet publicly identified the officer who shot Seavey or said how many times the officer fired. The officer, along with a second officer who responded to the scene, were both placed on standard paid administrative leave while the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office and Police Bureau homicide detectives investigate the shooting. Police said the second officer didn’t fire on Seavey but otherwise haven’t described the officer’s actions. The two officers responded around 10 a.m. to Northeast Marx Drive off 92nd Drive after someone who works in the area reported someone was stealing power from a nearby business, police said. At some point, there was “an encounter” between the officers and Seavey near an RV parked on the side of the road, and one of the officers shot and killed Seavey, police officials said. People nearby reported hearing seven to nine shots fired. Detectives found a handgun near Seavey’s body, police said. They have not said whether Seavey fired the gun. Portland police spokesperson Mike Benner on Friday declined to provide more details about the reported theft that preceded the shooting, saying the Police Bureau would release more information “when appropriate” and gave no timeline. Seavey is the third person to have been killed by Portland police so far this year. The two previous fatal shootings – in April in Clackamas County and in July in Gresham – happened outside of Portland. Grand juries found both shootings were legally justified. Police asked anyone with information about Wednesday’s shooting to contact detectives William Winters at William.Winters@police.portlandoregon.gov or Jason Koenig at Jason.Koenig@police.portlandoregon.gov, referencing case number 23-315194. -- Catalina Gaitán, cgaitan@oregonian.com, @catalinagaitan_ Our journalism needs your support.

SDSO was alerted to the incident by several 911 callers who reported a ""shootout."" ""I look outside, I see a bunch of police cars. I had my car on. Like, I look outside, I see 'bang,' 'bang,' 'bang.' It’s like fireworks and stuff, a bunch of cops and I was like, 'dang that’s crazy,'"" witness Sahil Whifie said. He was with his father, Rhafie, when the shooting began. The two hid behind a car to avoid being hit by a flying bullet. No civilians were injured, SDSO said. The shooting may have happened at close-range, Nisleit said, but that will be determined by the investigation. Medical aid was given to both the suspect and the sergeant and both were taken to a hospital, SDSO said. The suspect, whose identity is being withheld, was later pronounced dead. The sergeant, who has also not been identified, was alert and talking before he was taken in for surgery, the chief said. His wife remains with him in the hospital. His injuries included, “several skull fractures, a brain bleed and some other things,"" but he was out of surgery by 10:30 a.m. and expected to make a full recovery, Nisleit said. ""Next step is just wrap our arms around him, making sure he has everything he and his family needs, taking care of his needs, and then helping him through the phases of recovery,” Nisleit said. Nisleit spoke fondly of the sergeant, who is a 6-year veteran of the force and works with the SWAT team. He was promoted by the chief himself. ""The sergeant's a heck of a guy, you know, very proud of this sergeant,"" Nisleit said. ""He’s had a great career. He’s done very well for himself, does great, has great officers working for him. I wish him nothing but a speedy recovery."" Law enforcement said there are no outstanding suspects and there is no danger to the community. Nisleit commended his officers for their handling of the situation. ""We’re very fortunate, to your point, that more officers weren’t hit by gunfire or innocent citizens who might have just been doing some late shopping at the Ralphs grocery store or anywhere else in that mall,"" Nisleit said. The shopping center was expected to be closed until at least Friday afternoon. By 11 a.m. Friday, a few stores were cordoned off with police tape and remained closed, including a UPS Store and 4S Eye Care. The scene was cleared around 2 p.m. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the Homicide Unit at (858) 285-6330/after hours at (858) 565-5200. You can remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477. Other officer shootings At least three San Diego police officers, including the one involved in the incident at 4S Ranch, have been shot in the past 12 months, and all were involved in incidents involving stolen vehicles. On June 8, an officer was shot in the arm in Chollas Creek following a truck that had been reported stolen. Officials said later that day that the officer was ""recovering nicely and in good spirits."" Further back, on Dec. 12, 2022, Officer Javier Hernandez was hit by gunfire following a car chase in a stolen vehicle that ended in Mountain View. Police said at the time that the round that struck Hernandez round hit him in the chest of his bulletproof vest. This story will be updated as new information becomes available."

A Fort Myers Police Department (FMPD) officer shot and killed 57-year-old Christopher Jordan at his Stella Street home on the night of Dec. 1. After barricading himself inside the home for 45 minutes, Jordan walked up to a window and showed officers a gun. An FMPD officer then shot him. According to the Lee County NAACP, Jordan did not hurt anyone and was not a threat when he died. The NAACP said no one was in danger of immediate harm, and no one was inside the home when police arrived. The release states that people say Jordan was not a violent person. Witnesses say they never saw him with a weapon. The NAACP believes a mental health professional should have been involved. The release said FMPD had prior knowledge of nonviolent confrontations at the same address and wisely declined involvement. The NAACP assisted the family in filing a Federal Civil Rights Complaint on Tuesday, Dec. 5. The organization wants a federal investigation separate from FDLE. Per department policy, the FMPD officer involved in the shooting is on paid administrative leave. “The Lee County NAACP does support the FMPD and Chief Jason Fields. However, we remain vigilant against any historical re-occurrences of violence used by law enforcement against blacks or anyone, unjustifiably or unnecessarily,” the release said."

Shane James Jr., 34, was bonded out of Bexar County Jail in March 2022 by Laquita Garcia, the statewide policy coordinator for the Texas Organizing Project (TOP), jail records obtained by KSAT show.Â He had been arrested that January for alleged domestic violence against his parents and a sibling and had also been discharged from the U.S. Army in 2015 due to another domestic violence-related issue. TOP routinely bonds out accused criminals, freeing as many as 25 to 30 Bexar County Jail inmates per month on bonds totaling $5,000 or less, a law enforcement source told the outlet.Â Warrants for James’s re-arrest were issued shortly after TOP bonded him out, and he cut off his ankle monitor the day following his release, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar confirmed Wednesday. The sheriff also confirmed that deputies were called to James’s San Antonio-area home in a separate August 2023 “mental health” incident, but they “left the residence without taking him into custody on the misdemeanor warrants to avoid a potential violent confrontation,” according to KSAT.Â Just a few months later, police say James went on an hours-long killing spree throughout the area while having three pending cases for the alleged assault on his family members. Salazar identified two adults found dead of gunshot wounds in the suspect’s residence as Shane Matthew James Sr., 56, and Phyllis James, 55 â the parents of the alleged mass killer.Â Police believe they were killed sometime between Monday night and Tuesday morning. After allegedly killing his parents, James traveled about an hour and a half away to Austin, where he was accused of attacking more people. Austin Police Department Interim Chief Robin Henderson said her department received a call at 10:43 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) that a school district police officer had been shot at Northeast Early College High School, BBC reported. The north Austin school subsequently went on lockdown, and the officer “sustained non-life-threatening injuries,” according to KSAT. Another shooting later that morning claimed the lives of a man and woman further south in Austin, Henderson said. The victims were named as Sabrina Rahman, 24, and Emmanuel Pop Ba, 32, by the Austin-American Statesman.Â Family members confirmed to the publication that Rahman was pushing her one-year-old baby in a stroller when she was fatally shot. A male cyclist was also shot that afternoon, though he survived and is reportedly in stable condition. Austin police were frantically working on trying to figure out who shot the seemingly random people that evening when they were called to a home for an ongoing burglary, where they found James in the backyard.Â The suspect “immediately opened fire” on the responding officers, Henderson said. Officials said one officer was shot multiple times but is in stable condition, but two more unnamed victims were found dead inside the home.Â Police said James then led officers on a car chase, finally getting caught when he crashed his vehicle eight hours after the first Austin shooting took place.Â APD Releases Booking Photo of Suspect Involved in Multiple Incidents on December 5, 2023 Suspect: Shane James, White male, 34 years of age pic.twitter.com/lBIxrpRtVH — Austin Police Department (@Austin_Police) December 6, 2023 All in all, six people were killed, and three were injured. While law enforcement did not initially think the shootings across San Antonio and Austin were connected, they now believe James was the sole perpetrator. “An important thing to note, these incidents did not take place in one specific area of Austin, and the initial evidence we had did not show any similarities,” the Austin Police Department (APD) said in a press release Wednesday. “The Austin Police Department takes the safety of our community seriously, but we must do our due diligence to ensure the information we share is done in a timely and accurate manner.” Police said an active shooter alert was not sent out to residents because Tuesday’s incidents were “not an active shooting event.” “This was a series of events which took place in several different locations across the city with various or unknown motives and no specific commonality,” the department said. “It is not common practice for APD, or any other law enforcement agency, to issue any sort of alert for every shooting that happens in their jurisdiction with an unidentified shooter.” APD said James Jr. has been charged with murder in relation to the four killings in Austin, with murder charges for the San Antonio slayings expected to be filed in the coming days, BBC reported. The outlet noted that “he is expected to face other charges as well” for his alleged heinous crimes.Â Backlash began pouring in on social media for the circumstances leading up to the killings, with the nation’s largest police union slamming the “woke” criminal justice system. “According to reports the dirtbag who committed these heinous acts was out on 3 family violence bonds. Just another case of the woke revolving door criminal justice system failing and people paying with lives,” the National Fraternal Order of Police said on X. Please keep the 6 people murdered, their families and the two officers shot in your thoughts and prayers. According to reports the dirtbag who committed these heinous acts was out on 3 family violence bonds. Just another case of the woke revolving door criminal justice systemâ¦ — National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) (@GLFOP) December 6, 2023 TOP released a statement Wednesday evening saying the organization was “saddened” by the killing spree and that it would conduct a review of its bail program moving forward. The group, which boasts of organizing “Black and Latino communities to build political power,” said it was “profoundly saddened and deeply troubled by the recent tragic events involving Shane James.” “We condemn his most recent egregious acts, full stop. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the victims and their families during this incredibly difficult time,” TOP continued before recounting its involvement in James’s case and committing to remain “steadfast” in its mission. Through our justice program, we bailed out James in coordination with the Bexar Countyâs public defenderâs office, nearly two years ago in February 2022 on misdemeanor charges where his bond fees totaled $300. The events that have unfolded are devastating, and we recognize the pain and suffering this incident has caused. We take our responsibilities seriously and acknowledge that we must address both the immediate impact of this tragedy and the broader implications for our bail program. TOP was founded with a commitment to transforming Texas into a state that works for everyone. A piece of our work is reforming the criminal justice system, advocating for fairness, and providing support to those who have often been marginalized and underserved. We firmly believe in the presumption of innocence until proven guilty and our mission is to ensure that individuals have the opportunity to address their legal challenges while awaiting trial in a just and equitable manner. We want to make clear that TOP has a thorough and rigorous screening process in place to assess individuals who are eligible for our bail program, with a focus on assisting with misdemeanor offenses. James was deemed eligible based on our criteria at the time. However, TOP has had no interaction with James since March 2022. We acknowledge that our assessments cannot anticipate the future actions of individuals. We are committed to conducting a comprehensive internal review of our program and processes. We understand that some may try to use this tragedy to criticize bail programs, even for misdemeanors. We remain steadfast in our commitment to our mission, advocating for the rights and representation of all Texans. Additionally, we are acutely aware of the urgent need to address gun violence as an endemic issue in Texas and across the United States. We canât ignore the larger context in which incidents like these occur. Our commitment to transforming our state and nationâs criminal justice system includes advocating for sensible gun control measures and community safety initiatives that can help prevent tragedies. TOP provided campaign support to both Sheriff Salazar and Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales, KSAT reported. âThey provided a service that they had to put a dollar amount on,â Gonzales said, referring to door-to-door canvassing services provided by TOP that appeared on his campaign finance reports.Â TOP also canvassed on behalf of Salazar and sponsored an event for $1,500, campaign finance records show. Salazar, who initially declined to answer questions from KSAT about the group’s support of his election, eventually addressed the concerns in a press conference. âThereâs nothing for me to refund. They didnât do anything wrong in helping this gentleman exercise his right to bond. I donât regret anybody supporting me,â the sheriff said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) praised law enforcement and grieved “for the loved ones of the six Texans who were murdered” in a Wednesday statement. “Texans grieve for the loved ones of the six Texans who were murdered by a hardened criminal who must never see the light of day again. The murderer also shot two law enforcement officers in the line of duty,” Abbott said, continuing: Texas is a law-and-order state, and violence will never be tolerated. We thank all state and local law enforcement and first responders who apprehended this criminal and protected their communities. The State of Texas will provide all resources necessary to impose the full weight of law on this criminal for his despicable crimes. He went on to ask his fellow Texans to “join us in lifting up in prayer the families and loved ones of those who were killed, as well as the Texans who are recovering from injuries, including an Austin Police Officer and an Austin Independent School District police officer.” Texans grieve for the loved ones of 6 Texans murdered by a hardened criminal who must never see the light of day again.

This is not normal, and we can never let it become normal,” Biden said.

Perkins was killed by police in the early morning hours of Sept. 29th, following an incident surrounding a vehicle repossession. The mayor announced the decision during a news conference Thursday after a week of hearings that began Monday. Bowling said the decision is effective immediately. The mayor did not elaborate on what led to his decision during the hearings. You can watch the whole press conference here: The mayor said the names of the officers would not be shared due to an exception in the Alabama public records laws, however, he said those will be made public if the officers decided to appeal. The officers have seven days to appeal the decision to the city’s personnel board for review. Bowling said the city is also beginning the process of looking at its policies for police. “The city of Decatur will begin a top-to-bottom review of policing policies, practices and ways to improve including how we provide information to the public,” he said. Bowling began disciplinary hearings for officers involved in the shooting on Monday. These hearings followed Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion’s announcement that he had reprimanded four officers for violations of department policy in the Perkins shooting and recommended discipline. Members of the Perkins family spoke with News 19 after the press conference. Stephen Perkins’ bother Nicholas Perkins said that the family is disappointed with the ultimate result of the announcement. “Three officers being fired and one being suspended is no comparison to Catrela losing her husband, me losing my brother, my mom losing her son, that’s not justified. We want these officers prosecuted” Nicholas Perkins said. “We deserve more, Catrela definitely deserves more, this Perkins Family deserves more. And so we won’t give up until we get what we deserve.” Family Attorney Cannon Lambert says the decision took way too long. “The timing is significant,” he said. “When a bad thing happens and you address that bad thing promptly, then you infuse confidence into a community so that there is a way for the community to believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. When you string things along, hide information and use excuses… you fuel the flames that you say you want to put out.” Chief Pinion released a statement following the Mayor’s announcement, which you can read in full here: The Mayor has announced his decision that three officers have been terminated and one has been suspended following the determination hearing into officers’ actions leading up to the death of Steven Perkins and in the moments after. As I previously shared, I found in the predetermination hearing that the officers violated policy, however, under Alabama law, only the Mayor can make the decision to issue discipline of this magnitude. Any of the officers disciplined have the right to appeal the Mayor’s decision to the Personnel Board. I accompanied the Mayor when he visited Mr. Perkins’ family to share the news of his determination. I have expressed my sorrow personally to the family of Mr. Perkins as well as publicly in prior messages, but I reiterate that sentiment here. While the Mayor’s decision brings resolution to one portion of the investigation into what occurred, an active criminal investigation by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency continues. That investigation is independent of the now-concluded Decatur Police Department Administrative investigation. As I have said from the earliest days, we will accept whatever decision results from that process. This incident has left grief for many, beginning with the family and friends of Mr. Perkins and extending to our community and beyond, as well as within our police department. I have pledged to take action to ensure something like this never happens in Decatur again, and that process has begun in earnest. It includes reviewing policies and procedures to implement change where needed, additional training, revitalizing our Citizen Advisory Board, and creating a critical incident page on our website to provide an additional avenue to keep the community informed when a critical incident takes place. We will also be implementing measures to provide for increased officer health and mental wellness, to include budgeting for yearly mental health checkups. While there have been those who have come from outside of Decatur to exercise their 1st Amendment rights, my concern is foremost with those who call Decatur home. With a wide spectrum of feelings among members of our community, I want to reassure you that the Decatur Police Department serves each and every one of you. While it is my hope that you do not judge any organization by one incident, no matter how painful, I promise that we will be doing everything humanly possible to earn the benefit of your trust moving forward.Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency told News 19 Thursday that the investigation into potential criminal conduct in the Perkins case is still ongoing."

But local laws alone won’t stop violence",N,"Six months after a gunman killed 11 people at a Monterey Park dance studio, the City Council unanimously approved legislation to drastically limit where gun dealers are permitted in the San Gabriel Valley enclave. The battle over gun rights has filled headlines and courtrooms, and yet no one showed up at City Hall to address the ordinance. No residents, no advocates, no lawyers. Most Americans live within 10 minutes of a gun store. The Los Angeles Times set out to determine whether easy availability is a key driver of gun violence — but it’s not that simple. This series explores the complex relationship between firearm access and gun crime. “We didn’t really have any public comment,” Mayor Jose Sanchez said, adding that he only received “one or two emails” after the August vote. “Either it was a slow night or people just didn’t oppose it.” Cities across Los Angeles County are considering — and in many cases approving — sweeping changes to how and where they allow firearms dealers to operate. Meanwhile, daily gun violence and mass shootings continue. Just Wednesday a gunman opened fire at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, killing three people. Some municipalities, including Burbank, have instituted temporary moratoriums on new gun dealers to allow officials time to deliberate over more permanent solutions. Others, including Torrance, have restricted where dealers can open. Even so, some of the boldest changes have limited effect and are going largely unnoticed, The Times has found in a months-long exploration of gun access in America that incorporated more than 100 interviews and volumes of public records. In Monterey Park, the shooter killed his victims with a semiautomatic handgun that is banned in California today but was legal when he purchased it more than two decades ago. Researchers have begun to explore the influence of firearms dealers on nearby violence, and their findings are complicated. There’s little evidence that barring retailers from certain neighborhoods or requiring them to install video cameras, for example, can significantly drive down gun violence. Only large-scale changes in the number of firearms dealers across multiple neighboring counties had a meaningful impact on local gun homicides, the researchers found. “The average effect is actually quite small,” said David Johnson, associate professor of economics at the University of Central Missouri. And yet new regulations keep coming. Efforts to keep gun stores out of particular cities or neighborhoods are rooted in an assumption that more dealers equals more shootings. It’s a commonsense theory, given that most guns are sold by a licensed dealer before ending up on the streets and that people often purchase guns near their homes. A report this year by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found that between 2017 and 2021, only about one-third of the guns traced by law enforcement after being used in crimes were recovered within 10 miles of the dealers that sold them. Johnson’s 2021 study found that one additional dealer per 100 square miles in a county corresponds with a 2% increase in gun homicides in that county two years later. When the number of dealers in neighboring counties also rises at the same rate, the increase in gun homicides jumps to 4%. The Times corroborated Johnson’s findings with a similar national analysis, using the ATF’s list of federal firearms licenses and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mortality data to estimate the effect of dealer density on gun homicides. One additional dealer per 100 square miles in a county and its neighboring counties corresponded to a 4.8% increase in the initial county’s homicides, according to The Times analysis. The findings suggest that achieving a meaningful reduction in homicides in L.A. County would require more than 160 cities across Los Angeles, its four neighboring counties and their nearly 35,000 square miles to combine efforts to dramatically reduce the number of gun retailers in the region. Monterey Park — at about eight square miles — accounts for just one tiny piece of the puzzle. “There needs to be some sort of cooperation across jurisdictions,” Johnson said. Gun businesses, like localities, are not all the same. Some shops have firearms dealer licenses but only repair guns. Others sell just a few guns per year from residential garages or basements. Large retailers can move hundreds a week. Turner’s Outdoorsman, for example, has more than 30 locations across California. The company’s Norwalk outpost sold more than 102,000 guns from 2010 to 2022, of which more than 1,400 — about 1.4% — were later recovered by law enforcement as what are known as crime guns, firearms possessed illegally or found after commission of a crime or suspected crime. The Bakersfield location sold about 6,000 firearms during the same period, of which 22 — about 0.4% — were crime guns. Dealers also vary in their adherence to regulations, but comprehensive data on compliance do not exist. Dan Semenza, director of interpersonal violence research at the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center, found there were more shootings near dealers with serious violations of gun regulations than near those that complied with the rules. Examples of such violations include selling guns to people prohibited from owning them and failing to report multiple-firearm transactions to the ATF. Between 2016 and 2018, homicides nearly doubled for each additional noncompliant dealer nearby, Semenza found using limited ATF inspection data made public during a lawsuit and homicide data from Franklin County, Ohio. “These stores, especially the bad ones, are contributing to the markets that are ultimately fueling a lot of illegal weapons,” he said. In the wake of the Jan. 21 Monterey Park shooting, officials took bold steps to limit firearms in L.A. County’s unincorporated areas. On Feb. 7, the county Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a package of gun-related ordinances, including bans on sales of certain high-caliber guns and ammunition, and on carrying guns on county property. The board also approved measures directing staff and counsel to draft additional ordinances aimed at reining in gun dealers. In October, the supervisors considered an ordinance mandating that gun stores have security cameras, maintain new sales and inventory reports, and deny entry to unaccompanied minors, among other requirements. No one showed up to make public comment in person, and only one community member spoke remotely — about the role mental health problems play in gun violence. The board unanimously voted to approve the measure. Subscriber Exclusive Alert If you're an L.A. Times subscriber, you can sign up to get alerts about early or entirely exclusive content. You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. Last month, only five members of the public voiced their opinions remotely during a hearing on a county ordinance to establish a buffer zone barring new firearms dealers from opening within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, day care centers, libraries and other gun stores. Again, the supervisors voted unanimously for the measure. Had those regulations been in place in January, they would have done nothing to save the lives extinguished by Huu Can Tran, the gunman in the Monterey Park mass shooting. Tran killed his victims with a modified Cobray model CM11-9 pistol, L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna said shortly after the massacre. The handgun, with its threaded barrel and ability to take a high-capacity magazine, falls under California’s assault weapons ban. But the 72-year-old, who killed himself the day after the mass shooting, had legally purchased the firearm in February 1999 from a gun store in Monterey Park that has since closed, Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in an email. As cities across Southern California imposed restrictions on local firearms dealers, Jack Brandhorst came face-to-face with this new reality. Last year, he tried to relocate his small gun shop, Red Rifle Ltd., from a drab industrial park in Carson to Torrance’s downtown. In September 2022, he spoke at a well-attended Torrance planning commission meeting. Two months earlier, the city had granted Brandhorst a permit to do business in the walkable shopping district. But after several residents filed formal appeals, the city was reconsidering Brandhorst’s plan. There was no gun store buffer zone or moratorium on the books that would have barred Brandhorst from opening in Torrance. But he did need a special development permit if he wanted to be downtown. For 15 minutes, the gun seller answered questions from planning commissioners about the safety protocols his store follows to help prevent gun violence. He described his vision of Red Rifle as “another boutique, elegant shop” integrated into the downtown community. “Go get your biscuits and gravy from Clutch and Coffee, get that — mmm mmm mmm — chicken and waffles from Local Kitchen,” he said, naming two downtown Torrance eateries. “And then come by and pick you up a Glock and some bullets.” The gun dealer’s desired location was next door to Local Kitchen and two doors down from a performing arts school. Dozens of stores, offices and residences are within a few blocks’ radius. There’s an elementary school about a mile away and a high school half a mile away. Red Rifle sold 5,858 guns between 2010 and 2022, according to a June report by the state Department of Justice. Of those, 59, or just over 1%, were later recovered as crime guns in California. Katherine Kaopua owns a cheerleading and tumbling center about a block from the century-old former salon where Red Rifle intended to move. As one of the four residents who formally appealed the issuance of a special development permit for the gun dealer, she told the commission about a 1986 shooting she said demonstrated the risks of selling guns in downtown Torrance. That April, a man stole a loaded gun from a since-shuttered sporting goods store near the proposed Red Rifle location. He went out onto the street and began firing at Torrance police officers who had responded to the scene, striking and killing 25-year-old Officer Thomas Keller. Today, there’s a small memorial park named after Keller visible from the windows of the storefront Brandhorst was eyeing. “A police officer shot in the line of duty because there was an active shooter that stole a gun and ammo from a local downtown Torrance store,” Kaopua told the planning commission. In the end, the commission voted 5-2 to grant the appeal and deny Red Rifle its permit. After the hearing, Brandhorst vowed to appeal the decision to the full City Council. Past midnight on Nov. 16, 2022, after hours of testimony and debate, the council voted 6-1 to uphold the appeal. Brandhorst would not be allowed to fulfill his dream of operating a gun store in downtown Torrance. “These City Council people placated to the squeaky wheels,” he said afterward. “There’s no law or rule that limits gun stores in that area.” Shortly after the November decision, Torrance’s council had city staff study downtown zoning regulations. In May, after reviewing the staff’s findings, the council approved a new restriction on where gun dealers can operate. As of June, the regulation stated, a special development permit is no longer needed to open a business in downtown Torrance. But it also enumerated a list of business types that are no longer allowed downtown. The list includes establishments such as drive-through restaurants, check-cashing shops — and gun stores. Generations of racist economic policies and inequitable social structures correspond to higher rates of gun crime in certain areas, according to Jorja Leap, a professor at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and co-founder of the Watts Leadership Institute. For example, neighboring Forsyth and Fulton counties in Georgia each had dozens more nearby dealers in 2019 than in 2009. While Fulton County’s homicide rate increased by 90%, Forsyth County’s declined by 30%. Home to Atlanta, Fulton County also has a much higher percentage of Black residents and residents in poverty than Forsyth County, and more than 25 times its homicide rate. “People are poor. People don’t have resources. They don’t have mental health services,” Leap said. “A 12-year-old has lost a parent, or parents have walked out. He doesn’t go to therapy to deal with his feelings of anxiety and depression. He gets a gun.” The Times analysis found that the relationship between dealer proximity and gun homicides is strongest in places with concentrated poverty, large Black populations and existing high homicide rates. In counties where more than a fifth of residents are in poverty, the 4.8% increase in homicides jumps to more than 7%. Aqeela Sherrills, a former member of L.A.’s Grape Street Crips set, grew up in a family of gang members in Watts. Sherrills saw his best friend shot and killed in ninth grade and is a survivor of sexual violence. He knows what it feels like to want a gun for protection. “Poverty and trauma underscore violence,” said Sherrills, who is now a prominent advocate for safer communities. “Just 2% of the population is responsible for 80% of the harm.” Without social services, a fair justice system and community investment, he said, the cycle of poverty and violence continues and “small incidents turn into all-out war.” Paul Carrillo says he “grew up in a pretty violent community in South L.A.” His father was a gang member, so he joined up when he was 14 years old. Over time he realized there was no future in that life. Now, three decades later, Carrillo is vice president of the Giffords Center for Violence Intervention, where he pushes federal and state representatives to fund local support services. “How accessible firearms are to Black and brown people who are willing to use them is a huge problem,” he said. But “just regulating guns in and of itself is not going to solve everything. … There’s still poverty, there’s still police violence, there’s still homelessness and all that. So it’s not one or the other. It’s both.” The harsh reality, Carrillo said, is that guns are big business: “There’s definitely people who don’t give a crap that it’s Black and brown [people] killing each other while they’re making money.” But Michael Eberhardt, the ATF’s former firearms operations division chief, said he thinks it’s possible to move the needle. He said he believes making guns more expensive, instituting waiting periods and even providing dealers with reports detailing crimes involving the guns they sold could make a difference. “Gun dealers are mentally disconnected from violent gun crime. They just see it on the news,” he said. “They don’t correlate their own actions with violent gun crime. But we can change that.” Subscriber Exclusive Alert If you're an L.A.

At issue is whether Sanchez reacted appropriately to the attack as he was being handed a sausage sample. Sanchez was holding his 22-month-old son when he was slugged by French, who a relative has described as a “gentle giant.” A witness is expected to testify that in the seconds after the punch, French had a “face of anger” and was in “a ready-to-fight posture,” Schwartz said. Body-worn camera video from Corona police played Wednesday showed Sanchez lying on the floor saying, “I see a blast and I feel my head get knocked down. I thought I was shot.” But French, a 32-year-old intellectually disabled man, was not armed. A doctor is expected to testify that Sanchez suffered a concussion. Sanchez is also charged with two counts of assault with a firearm causing great bodily injury for the wounds to the parents. Schwartz told jurors that Sanchez had “tunnel vision” focusing on French and that he didn’t see the parents rushing to protect and push away their son. Deputy Attorney General Mike Murphy, the prosecutor, told jurors that Sanchez panicked and failed to realize that he was no longer threatened after the punch. “This case is about a deadly overreaction,” Murphy said. “It was extremely reckless, unreasonable and unlawful. A witness will tell you it’s the quickest draw he had ever seen.” Sanchez, 33, has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. He is not in custody after posting bail. He faces 33 years in prison if convicted of all of the charges, Murphy said. During a morning break, Sanchez hugged supporters outside the courtroom. While the attorneys told jurors what they should expect to hear during the trial, there is information they will not learn from the testimony. Daniel Franc, a doctor with the Los Angeles Brain Science Project, examined Sanchez in 2021 and, after reading reports and witness statements, concluded Sanchez’s actions in the deli were reasonable in light of the head injury he suffered. “His perception of the person standing before him holding a gun is a reasonable split-second interpretation for an individual who had concussion/traumatic brain injury immediately prior to such perceptions,” Franc wrote in his report to the defense team. “Based on the available information and the effects of the concussion/mild traumatic brain injury, he made the reasonable decision as any other reasonable person in his specific circumstances, to use defense force to protect himself, his child and other members of the public. “Mr. Sanchez has recollections of the moments subsequent to his head trauma that are not consistent with aspects of the factual record,” Franc continued. “Corrupted memory and recall are expected after head injury due to temporary dysfunction of memory.” But after a series of motions on both sides, jurors will hear testimony from Franc only on the effects of concussions and that Sanchez suffered one. Franc will not be allowed by the judge to testify about the reasonableness of Sanchez’s actions, Schwartz said in an interview. Additionally, Russell French testified during the preliminary hearing that his son did not receive extensive mental-health treatment. But the number of medical records that Schwartz subpoenaed — and was largely denied — suggest otherwise, Schwartz said. Jurors will be told only that French has received mental-health treatment, Schwartz said. The state Attorney General’s Office is prosecuting the case after Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin declined to do so. Attorney General Rob Bonta concluded that Sanchez’s action as a police officer — shooting Kenneth French after French struck Sanchez — was not reasonable. That night, Sanchez, French, and his parents were standing in line for sausage samples in the deli of the Costco warehouse store on McKinley Street. Kenneth, who didn’t talk, lived with his parents in the Lake Hills area near Corona. Suddenly and unprovoked, Kenneth French slugged Sanchez in the back of his head as Sanchez held his son. Sanchez fell and struck his head on the floor. He told investigators that he thought he saw a “flash of light,” believed he had been shot and saw French, who was determined to be unarmed, holding a gun. A witness said he saw French facing Sanchez with clenched fists. In under four seconds after the punch, Sanchez pulled out his service revolver and began firing, despite Paola French shouting, “Don’t shoot!” Sanchez unleashed 10 shots, seriously wounding French’s parents and killing their son. A single, distant security camera recorded a short, blurry video that captured a portion of the confrontation. The tape did little to clarify the events. Sanchez identified himself as an officer to the arriving police, and he was not arrested. He was taken to Corona Regional Medical Center for treatment. On Wednesday, Paola French, 64, sobbed and cried through much of her testimony. She broke down answering prosecutor Murphy’s first question, “How many children do you have?” — prompting Superior Court Judge Jason L. Stone to briefly excuse the jury while French collected herself. She then said she had two children until Kenneth was killed. She sobbed again when Murphy played a video that shows her, Russell and Kenneth entering the warehouse store. She testified that she saw her son “move someone out of the way with his hand,” and then saw a man who said he was a police officer pointing a gun at them and firing. She used her right hand to mimic a gun and thrust it forward three times as she recalled first she being shot, followed by her husband and then her son. Russell French, 62, followed her to the witness stand. He said that after being shot, he tried to stay alive so there would be someone to testify about Sanchez’s actions. “If all of us died, this guy would have become a hero,” French said. When Murphy asked him about his many surgeries, French said, “I could become a priest. I’m like the Holy Father. I’ve got holes all around.” District Attorney Michael Hestrin handed the case off to the county grand jury, which, he explained, could subpoena witnesses who would not talk to his investigators. And, he said: “It was the type of case where the community needs to weigh in and draw the lines.” He denied he withheld prosecution to maintain favor with law enforcement. The Los Angeles Police Department fired Sanchez because officials determined that the shooting was not within policy. In October 2021, a federal jury awarded the Frenches $17 million after they filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Sanchez and the LAPD. The case is being heard in Indio because that was the only county courthouse where a courtroom was available for an anticipated monthlong trial, Schwartz said."

The police shooting occurred Oct. 31 at a Chevron gas station at Garfield Avenue and Beverly Boulevard. In November, Long Beach police released video showing the moments leading up to a detective firing twice at Oscar Alejandro Ramires, 33, of Montebello — hitting him once in the upper body as he attempted to drive away after police surrounded him. Ramires rammed multiple civilian and police vehicles in the gas station, video shows. He had hit one undercover police SUV and one civilian SUV before the first shot was fired — a moment before the suspect hit the undercover minivan with the detective. The detective was knocked out through an open door after Ramires rammed it with his car. Ramires fled and hit another car on Via Altamira, with two occupants who were not injured, police said. Officers found him on the ground in a garage in the 600 block of the street, a block south of his home. Aside from identifying Ramires as a suspect wanted for attempted murder, police released no further details about that case. But a detective wrote in the court document that Ramires was identified as the suspect in a number of crimes, including the attempted murder of a woman Ramires, and other members of his gang, believed was going to testify against a gang member in an upcoming preliminary hearing. On Sept. 25, Ramires and another woman showed up in a car at a home in the 6000 block of Olive Avenue in Long Beach, police said. He fired four shots after the victim came to the front of the house, hitting her once in a leg, court documents show. Police initially arrested the woman during an investigation into a 2022 homicide but the District Attorney’s Office dropped the charges against her after she gave a statement to prosecutors against one of her co-defendants, the detective wrote. “Homicide detectives believe the … gang was targeting her for violence to prevent her from testifying,” police wrote in the search warrant. “This is based on multiple recorded jail calls, prison calls and social media posts.” Among the social media posts, the detective wrote, Ramires reposted one that appeared to be a $5,000 bounty targeting the woman. Before police say he shot her, Ramires was accused of pistol-whipping the woman and warning her against testifying, the detective wrote. The woman failed to appear in court and an arrest warrant was issued. The woman is now in protective custody. Police believe Ramires was also involved in a pair of car-to-car shootings in October after shell casings found at both scenes matched the markings of casings found from the shooting in the 6000 block of Olive Avenue, the detective wrote. Ramires has since been charged with attempted murder, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and dissuading a witness by force or fear, police said. He also faces a charge of assault on a peace officer and four counts of assault with a deadly weapon in relation to the Oct. 31 police shooting. He was being held in jail on more than $2 million bail, according to inmate records."

A press release notes that the vehicle was stolen, and that the firearm that was recovered was found in ""close proximity"" to one of the suspects on the scene. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact the Waukesha Police Dept. at (262) 524-3831. MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman briefed the media on Thursday, Dec. 7 at around 6:50 a.m. regarding a shooting that reportedly occurred near 51st and Hampton at around 3:22 a.m. At around 3:17 a.m., police reportedly observed a car that was wanted in connection to an earlier shooting. Norman said that a subsequent foot pursuit involving two men from a vehicle took place, one said to be visibly armed. The situation escalated on 51st St. where multiple shots were reportedly fired. Two suspects were struck, according to Norman. One 19-year-old Milwaukee man was critically injured and transported for medical care, and a 22-year-old Milwaukee man was treated for minor injuries.

Peter Simon, 54, of Woodsville, New Hampshire, was driving a stolen Ford F-150 pickup truck on Totten Pond Road around 4:15 p.m. Wednesday when he attempted to do a U-turn in traffic, struck a Jeep Wrangler, causing his truck to go up on two wheels before slamming back down and driving off, according to prosecutors. About a quarter of a mile down the road, Simon is accused of crashing his truck into a police detail and National Grid crew working on a possible gas leak, killing 58-year-old Waltham Police Officer Paul Tracey and 36-year-old National Grid worker Roderick Jackson and injuring two other National Grid employees. Get New England news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NECN newsletters. The other workers have not been identified. Previous reports involving Peter Simon document a pattern of wild car chases, violence against police, and struggle with substance abuse and severe mental illness. In court on Thursday, Simon appeared for his latestâand most tragicâbrush with the law. âOnce I made the connection, it came back to me fairly vividly,â said Peter Heed, the former top prosecutor in Cheshire County. Heed was county attorney in 2009 when Simon led police on a wild chase where officers shot at his truck as he sped through a busy shopping center in Keene. âIn trying to get out of the parking lot, he actually drove over a huge grassy median and went flying in the air like youâd see in the movies,â Heed recalled. âHe went out to the main highway and collided head-on with a local transit bus.â The two people on the bus suffered serious injuries. However, Simon emerged from his burning truck and ran to a nearby business before he was finally arrested. Heed said a witness described the series of events like a scene from the movie ""Terminator."" Simon was later arraigned on a long list of charges while wearing a hospital gown. However, instead of being criminally convicted, records show he was found not guilty by reason of mental illness and committed to a secure psychiatric unit at the New Hampshire State Prison. âIt was very clear from all the evidence that he was suffering from a mental illness and he was dangerous,â Heed said. Simon was later transferred to New Hampshire State Hospital for treatment. Court records show he was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. Dr. Michelle DiBlasi, who has no connection to Simonâs case, is the chief of inpatient psychiatry at Tufts Medical Center. âUsually, that is linked to people having substantial childhood trauma,â DiBlasi said. âActually, 90% of people who have dissociative identity disorder had some sort of significant trauma as a child.â DiBlasi said the disorder is treated with intense therapy and is often accompanied by other struggles like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse. âThe goal is trying to work with the person to sort of put together their identities, kind of bring them all back into one,â DiBlasi said. Court records show that Simonâs condition improved through therapy and antipsychotic medication, according to medical professionals who evaluated him. âIt appears Mr. Simon is more psychiatrically stable than he has at perhaps any time in his life,â a doctor wrote. However, after his release from the state hospital in 2015, records show the criminal history continued. Simon was arrested in May of 2016 in Franklin, New Hampshire, for a violent altercation with a couple outside their home. The woman told police that Simon had attempted to kill her husband by strangling him. âPeter had a power cord around my husbandâs neck and had him on the ground. My husbandâs head was twisted to one side and he was making gurgling sounds,â the woman told police. After that, Simon retrieved a hammer from his van and also threatened the woman while swinging the tool in the air. âIâm going to kill you, too,â Simon said, according to the police report. While attempting to flee police, court records say he endangered the public by driving in the oncoming lanes of traffic and turning off his headlights to avoid detection. When police arrested Simon, he had a blood alcohol level of .16. An officer reported Simon had a laceration on his forehead and noticed a piece of fencing sticking out of the grill of his van. It turned out Simon had smashed into a fence and another vehicle when he initially tried to flee the scene of the assault. At the hospital, police said, Simon seemed surprised when they informed him about the litany of criminal charges he was facing. âSimon became increasingly confused as his time at the hospital dragged on,â the officer wrote in his report. âHe asked several times why he was there and who I was.â Simon pleaded guilty the following year in Merrimack Superior Court to aggravated DUI, disobeying an officer, criminal threatening, and 2nd degree assault where he was sentenced two to four years in state prison. In 2019, Simon was pulled over in Orford, New Hampshire, for speeding and driving with a suspended license. In the police report it said there was a non-extraditable warrant for Simon out of Washington. The NBC 10 investigators have also found multiple arrests for Simon out of Kansas and a felony conviction out of Montana back in 1999. Heed, the former county attorney, knows there will be questions about the circumstances surrounding Simonâs release from the stateâs secure mental health facility. âIt saddens me so much to see that this man has now caused such a tragedy in Waltham,â he said."

Gov. Greg Abbott thanked law enforcement on social media, and said that “violence will never be tolerated …Texans grieve for the loved ones of the six Texans who were murdered by a hardened criminal who must never see the light of day again. The State of Texas will provide all resources necessary to impose the full weight of law on this criminal for his despicable crimes.” Editorial credit: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com"

After numerous financial setbacks, the U.S. has hit a milestone for offshore windpower. An 800-foot turbine in New London, Connecticut is now sending electricity onto the grid from the wind farm east of Montauk. It is shaping up to be the country's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm. Currently, two 11-megawatt turbines are up. The other 10 are expected to open by early next year and generate 132 megawatts to power to more than 70,000 homes.

Desperation grows among Palestinians trapped with little aid as Israel battles Hamas in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) â Israeli forces struck the southern Gaza town of Rafah twice overnight, sowing fear in one of the last places where civilians can seek refuge. Israel has widened its offensive against Hamas from the devastated north to southern areas already packed with displaced people. United Nations officials say there are no safe places in Gaza. Heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis has displaced tens of thousands of people and cut most of Gaza off from deliveries of food, water and other vital aid. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres used a rarely exercised power to warn the Security Council of an impending âhumanitarian catastropheâ and urged members to demand a cease-fire. The United States appeared likely to block any such effort. Israel designates safe zone in Gaza. Palestinians and aid groups say it offers little relief MUWASI, Gaza Strip (AP) â Israel has designated a small slice of land along Gazaâs Mediterranean coast as a safe zone. It says waves of people fleeing the war can find protection from airstrikes and receive humanitarian supplies for their families there. But the reality? The area of Muwasi is a makeshift tent camp where thousands of dazed Palestinians live in squalid conditions in scattered farm fields and waterlogged dirt roads. Roughly 20 square kilometers (8 square miles) in southwest Gaza, Muwasi lies at the heart of a heated battle between Israel and international humanitarian organizations over the safety of Gazaâs civilians. Trump's vow to only be a dictator on 'day one' follows growing worry over his authoritarian rhetoric TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) â Donald Trump's assertion that he would only be a dictator on âday oneâ of a second term comes as he is facing growing scrutiny over his increasingly authoritarian and violent rhetoric. The consequences of that rhetoric were made clear following the deadly storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and after he tried to remain in power despite losing his 2020 reelection bid. The former president is now vowing vengeance and retribution as he runs again. He is outlining a second-term agenda marked by an unprecedented expansion of executive power and interference in the justice system, along with a massive civil service purge. House votes to censure Democratic Rep. Bowman for pulling a fire alarm in a Capitol office building WASHINGTON (AP) â The House has voted to censure Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman for triggering a fire alarm in a U.S. Capitol office building when the chamber was in session. The New York congressman Thursday became the third Democrat in the House to be admonished this year through the process. Censure is a punishment one step below expulsion from the House and has become routine in the last year. Republicans claim Bowman pulled the alarm in September to âcause chaos."" Bowman late Wednesday said he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and apologized for his mistake. The prominent progressive was surrounded by fellow Democrats, who criticized Republicans for what they called a âstupidâ resolution. UNLV gunman had list of targets at the university and 150 rounds of ammunition, police say LAS VEGAS (AP) â Police say the suspect in a deadly shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, had a list of targets at the school and at East Carolina University in North Carolina, where he once worked. Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Thursday that the suspect, identified as 67-year-old Anthony Polito, also had 150 additional rounds of ammunition before he was killed by police. Officials say three faculty members were killed and a fourth was wounded Wednesday. Authorities say that before the rampage, Polito had sent out 22 letters with no return address to university faculty members across the United States. The sheriff says police have contacted everyone on the suspectâs list, except for one person who was on a flight. Texas judge grants pregnant woman permission to get an abortion despite stateâs ban AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â A Texas judge has given a pregnant woman whose fetus had a fatal diagnosis permission to get an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to the stateâs ban that took effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. It was unclear Thursday how quickly or whether Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, will be able to obtain an abortion. State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble has granted a temporary restraining order allowing Cox to have an abortion. The state has not said if it plans to appeal. Cox is 20 weeks pregnant. Her attorneys say Cox went to an emergency room this week for a fourth time during her pregnancy. Trump appeals ruling rejecting immunity claim as window narrows to derail federal election case WASHINGTON (AP) â Former President Donald Trump is appealing a ruling that found he is not immune from criminal prosecution over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. That's according to court papers filed Thursday. Lawyers for the 2024 Republican presidential primary front-runner filed a notice of appeal indicating that they will challenge U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkanâs decision rejecting Trumpâs bid to derail the case headed to trial in Washington, D.C., in March. Trumpâs lawyers have asserted that he cannot face criminal charges because the actions spelled out in the indictment fell within his duties as president. Ospreys had safety issues long before they were grounded. A look at the aircraft's history WASHINGTON (AP) â When the U.S. military took the extraordinary step of grounding its fleet of V-22 Ospreys this week, it wasn't reacting just to the recent deadly crash of the aircraft off the coast of Japan. The aircraft has had a long list of problems in its short history. The Osprey takes off and lands like a helicopter, but can tilt its propellers horizontally to fly like an airplane. It's a unique and complex technology that has allowed it to deliver troops quickly to the battlefield. But that same technology has also been a factor in multiple incidents. There have been persistent questions about a mechanical problem with the clutch that has troubled the program for more than a decade. Centenarian survivors of Pearl Harbor attack return to honor those who perished 82 years ago PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) â Pearl Harbor survivor Ira Schab returned to the Hawaii naval base 82 years after Japanâs bombing propelled the U.S. into World War II. Schab was one of just five survivors at a remembrance ceremony for the more than 2,300 servicemen killed on Dec. 7, 1941. Six men had been expected, but one of the increasingly frail men wasn't able to attend. The aging pool of Pearl Harbor survivors has been rapidly shrinking. There is now one crew member of the USS Arizona still living. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doesnât have statistics for how many Pearl Harbor survivors are alive."

U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Torresen on Wednesday dismissed four counts of a lawsuit by Lena Gerber against Deputy Isaac Ward and the Aroostook County Sheriff’s Office. In the suit, Gerber claimed she was injured when Ward shot the man holding her hostage. The sheriff’s office asked in November for the partial dismissal largely because Gerber waited too long to file her claim. The shooting happened on April 14, 2021, when Jacob Wood, 28, was at Gerber’s residence. In an interview with a Maine Attorney General’s Office detective, Gerber said Wood was high on methamphetamine and drinking, and wanted to commit suicide by cop. Deputies arrived at Gerber’s home to find Wood holding a knife to her throat. After Ward repeatedly ordered him to drop the knife, he did not, and Ward shot twice. The shots killed Wood and also hit Gerber, according to the lawsuit and the attorney general’s report on the shooting. Two days after the incident, Gerber told an attorney general’s office detective that Deputy Ward had tried to protect her, according to documents the Bangor Daily News obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request. The detective interviewed Gerber in the hospital and reported she had bandages on her left arm and upper torso. Gerber filed suit in August with nine charges against the sheriff’s office, Deputy Isaac Ward and her former attorney, Jeffery Pickering. The suit said the shots grazed Gerber’s side and fractured her sternum. Charges included that she had a right not to be shot by police as a hostage victim, that deputies didn’t use nonlethal means to negotiate with Wood, that the sheriff’s office didn’t properly educate deputies on hostage negotiations, and that deputies used excessive deadly force. She also charged that Pickering failed to file her claims before deadlines expired. Attorneys from Wheeler & Arey of Bangor, representing the sheriff’s office, filed Oct. 9 to dismiss four counts of the lawsuit: that deputies failed to protect Gerber; that their actions caused Gerber significant emotional distress; that the sheriff’s office failed to educate Ward and other deputies on handling “suicide by cop” situations; and that the sheriff’s office is liable for the harm Gerber suffered. Torresen ruled that Gerber is bound by the Maine Tort Claims Act, which states people must notify a government agency of claims against it within one year, and in case of exceptions within two years. Gerber’s suit was filed two years and four months after the incident. Gerber alleged the notice deadline did not apply because her injuries came from a gun and that the shooting wasn’t carried out in the line of Ward’s duties, according to Torresen’s decision. “Gerber’s arguments are not persuasive,” Torreson wrote. Gerber also charged that Ward shouldn’t be protected by immunity in using a weapon while performing his duties, because a gun is “equipment.” Under Maine law, a governmental entity is responsible for property damage or personal injury that occurs in the use of vehicles, machinery and equipment. Even if Gerber could prove that Ward was not using the gun in the line of duty, she still must comply with rules to notify the sheriff’s office of her claims against it within the time limit, Torresen said. The lawsuit’s remaining counts are: a Fourth Amendment violation of unreasonable seizure because Gerber had a right not to be shot by police; 14th Amendment violation regarding the right not to be shot by police; use of excessive deadly force by Ward; violation of Gerber’s civil rights alleging that de-escalation maneuvers were not used by police; and legal malpractice on the part of Pickering. The Maine attorney general’s office exonerated Ward in February, saying he acted in Gerber’s defense. The attorney general investigates all cases of police use of deadly force to determine if the officers’ actions were justified, but it has never found an officer unjustified. No response to the Oct. 9 motion for dismissal was filed by Gerber or her attorneys. Her lawsuit demanded a jury trial. No further court date has been set."

Polito, 67, applied “numerous” times for jobs at several Nevada System Higher Education institutions and was denied, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said in a media conference Thursday. Earlier on Thursday, information was uncovered that Polito had a website where he posted his own “theories” on “various mysteries and puzzles,” including the Zodiac killer case, which he claimed to have solved. Police believe Polito was working alone. The timeline According to McMahill, Polito arrived on campus at 11:28 a.m. in a 2007 Lexus vehicle, parking in a lot south of the Beam Hall. Polito entered the hall at 11:33 a.m., and shots were first reported at 11:45. UNLV and LVMPD police arrived and heard shooting from inside Beam Hall and went inside “immediately and without hesitation,” McMahill said. The response time of the first officer on scene was 78 seconds. At 11:55, Polito exited the building, where two UNLV officers confronted him, leading to a shootout. UNLV officers shot Polito multiple times, and he was pronounced dead on the scene. Security camera video was displayed, showing the moment police opened fire on Polito. On Thursday, McMahill said Polito was armed with a handgun and brought 11 magazines of ammo with him, 9 of which were found on him. The gun Polito used was bought legally in 2022. Police said they do not know at the time of publication how many rounds Polito fired. The victims All three of the victims who were killed were found inside the building, and all were faculty members. The three people killed in the shooting on UNLV’s campus Wednesday were identified by the Clark County coroner’s office. The victims are Professor Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64, of Henderson, Nevada, and Assistant Professor Patricia Navarro-Velez, 39, of Las Vegas, and Associate Professor Naoko Takemaru, 69. According to McMahill, the fourth victim is a 38-year-old man who was taken to a local hospital by police shortly after the shooting. On Friday, LVMPD officials listed his condition as stable. The fourth victim was a visiting professor. Police said two of the victims were found on the third floor and the third victim was found on the fourth floor. “This is a day that we are not going to forget,” UNLV President Keith Whitfield said in Thursday’s briefing. “It is a day that’s marked in our history from now on.” The letters Police found a dashcam in Polito’s vehicle, and using that camera, they were able to determine that Polito went to a Henderson post office before the shooting. At the post office, Polito sent 22 letters to University personnel across the country with no return address on any of the envelopes. During a screening of some of the intercepted envelopes, police discovered the first letter opened had an “unknown white powder substance” in it. On Thursday evening, LVMPD officials said that the white powder found inside the envelopes mailed by Polito was deemed harmless. Police contacted the recipients of the letter, McMahill said. Sheriff McMahill is encouraging anyone in the education world who receives a letter with no return address should contact their local authorities, especially those at East Carolina University or UNLV. The suspect’s home After the shooting, Metro officers went to Polito’s apartment, where they found more evidence. According to McMahill, police found a chair with an arrow on it that pointed down to a document, which McMahill said was “similar to a last will and testament.” Police also found several computers and hard drives, as well as ammo that matched the cartridge cases found at the scene. McMahill said Polito had a “list” of people he targeted on campus. None of the victims who were killed were on that list. Also on that list were faculty members at East Carolina University. Sheriff McMahill said Polito was “struggling financially” and an eviction notice was found on his door. According to Sheriff McMahill, Polito also had a previous history of computer trespassing in Virginia in 1992. Anyone with information or video inside Beam Hall or who witnessed the shooting between the officers and the suspect should call detectives at (702) 828-3521 or Crimestoppers at (702) 385-5555."

Chief of Patrol John Chell noted this was the second time in four days officers responding to a 911 call for assistance found themselves “under some sort of attack, and had to defend themselves.”Â However, in this instance, Chell revealed the suspect may have been on a mission to end his own life. âInside that vehicle, we do have a note indicating that the individual wanted to commit suicide for various things going on his life, but he also apologized to our cops for what was about to happen,â Chief Chell said. According to Chief Chell, two cops rushed to West 177th Street and Haven Avenue at around 2:55 a.m. on Dec. 7 after police received multiple 911 calls of an apparent vehicle collision. As the two responding officers got closer to an involved vehicle, they saw two people inside. âOne officer approaches the passenger side where there is a female, a second officer approaches the driver’s side, where immediately upon approaching that car, the door opens up,â Chell said. At that moment, Chell noted, a 19-year-old man wearing a ski mask and brandishing a gun leapt out of the vehicle and ran at the cops. That led the officers to pull out their service weapons and fire about eight shots â two of which struck the man in the chest. EMS rushed the wounded suspect to a local hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery and is expected to survive. Charges against him are pending the results of an ongoing investigation. Meanwhile, the female passenger is being questioned at a local precinct about what led up to the shooting, it was reported. The responding officers were also transported to a local hospital for an evaluation; they were not physically injured. The investigation remains ongoing. The NYPD Force Investigation Division examines police shooting incidents. If you or someone you love is suicidal, call the Suicide and Crisis Hotline at 988 immediately."

At around 11:15 p.m., APD says one of its officers was conducting a traffic stop at US 290 and Cameron Road for a motorcyclist operating a vehicle without a license plate. READ MORE: Body, dash cam footage released from Cameron Road officer-involved shooting The suspect, later identified as Brandon Munoz, then ran toward a shopping center, got into a parked car, and tried to carjack the vehicle, telling the driver to back out, according to law enforcement. The driver of the vehicle got out uninjured, but Ostrander and Bradburn both fired at Munoz, hitting him. He was taken to the hospital with critical, life-threatening injuries. Munoz was charged with first-degree felony aggravated kidnapping, and according to Travis County court records, was placed on deferred adjudication on Sept. 8, 2023. The DA's office says that since Jan. 1, 2021, 91 cases against law enforcement officers have been presented to a grand jury, and in 58 of those cases, the grand jury did not return indictments.

Alan Hostetter, who spewed conspiracy theories during his trial and again at his sentencing hearing Thursday, was found guilty of multiple felony charges, including conspiracy, in July.Â The Justice Department said Hostetter drove from his home state of California to Washington, D.C., before Jan. 6 instead of flying “so that he could load his car with weapons.” Federal prosecutors said he met up with others on the morning of the attack and brought “tactical gear, a helmet, hatchets, knives, stun batons, pepper spray, and other gear for himself and others.” He attended the rally at the White House Ellipse before walking to the Capitol, carrying a hatchet in his backpack, according to prosecutors. He joined a group who pushed through a line of police officers guarding a lower terrace on the west side of the Capitol. Once on the upper level, Hostetter shouted, “The people have taken back their house. Hundreds of thousands of patriots showed up today to take back their government!” In arguments Thursday, a Justice Department attorney recounted Hostetter’s actions and said he was “a terrorist” on Jan. 6. The prosecutor cited Hostetter’s comments in the days before the attack, in which he allegedly said, “Choke that city off. Fill it with patriots.” He urged others to “put the fear of God into members of Congress.” In a nearly hour-long statement asking for leniency, Hostetter claimed the 2020 election was “stolen” and unfurledÂ a series of other baseless theories, including an assertion that Jan. 6 was a “false flag” operation orchestrated by the federal government. He alleged there were “crisis actors” amid the mob, claiming “hundreds, if not thousands” of people were part of an intentional “set-up” by the government meant to ensnare protestors. Hostetter also referenced presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, who referred to Jan. 6 as an “inside job” at the Republican debate in Alabama on Wednesday. Hostetter said the comment is an indication that his beliefs are no longer “fringe” theories. Judge Royce Lamberth, who found Hostetter guilty earlier this year, proceeded to hand down one of the longest sentences issued in any of the roughly 1,200 cases related to Jan. 6 that have been brought to date. In sentencing Hostetter to 135 months in prison, Lamberth said, “The First Amendment doesn’t give anybody the right to obstruct, impede or carry weapons into restricted areas.” During his lengthy statement in court, Hostetter also referred to Ashli Babbitt, a member of the riotous mob who was fatally shot by police as she was climbing through a window just outside the House chamber, near trapped members of Congress. Hostetter said he doesn’t believe Babbitt was actually killed and that the reports of her death are part of a “psyop.” Babbitt’s mother was in the court watching Hostetter’s hearing at the time. She told CBS News she was gravely offended by Hostetter’s words, but disagrees with the length of the sentence issued, calling it excessive. Hostetter will report to federal prison in early January, around the three-year mark of the Capitol siege. He said he will appeal his conviction."

The officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the St. Paul Police Department said in a prepared account of the incident released a few hours later. The other individual, who the department said was suspected of violating a protection order, sustained life-threatening injuries. The suspect remained at Regions Hospital on Thursday night, Sgt. Mike Ernster said at a news briefing. No further information about the suspect's condition was immediately available. The officer was treated at Regions and released Thursday night. According to police, just after 2 p.m. officers were called to the area of Marshall and Cretin avenues in response to a 911 caller who said she had an order for protection against a man who was following her as she drove in the area. ""She reported the man was intentionally driving his vehicle into hers, was armed with a handgun and had broken a window out of her vehicle,"" the department's account said. A responding officer confronted the man, and the suspect fired, striking the officer in the lower leg, the department said. The officer returned fire, critically injuring the suspect. Medics were called and began providing first aid to the injured suspect, the police account said. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Police Chief Axel Henry also spoke at the news briefing. The department said the officer was wearing an activated body camera. Cara Corey, who was inside her home across the street from the incident, said she heard ""a bunch"" of gunshots before she went outside to look. Corey said she saw an officer limping in the middle of the road. She also heard a woman crying and yelling about a man who was shot at the scene. ""She just wailed for like half an hour,"" Corey said. ""She kept saying, 'They shot him in the head,' 'What am I going to tell my kids?' and things like that."" Moments after a call went out of ""officer shot"" over dispatch audio, all available squads were ordered to Marshall and Cretin. In response, more than a dozen marked and unmarked St. Paul police squads rushed past traffic on westbound Interstate 94 toward the scene of the shooting. Corey said she noticed the officer who had been limping was gone after she briefly went inside her home. A video taken by Corey shows an officer performing CPR on the man in the street with other officers standing nearby. She said she later saw him being loaded onto a gurney. Serake Alema, who works at the Black Coffee and Waffle Bar, said he heard the shots before seeing police cars arrive. ""I had looked down and then looked up and saw about 10 cop cars were here,"" Alema said. Both roads were closed off while police investigated. A large number of neighbors and college students from the nearby University of St. Thomas were milling around in the aftermath but said they didn't see what happened. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will investigate the incident. Return to startribune.com for updates to this developing story.

According to Richmond Police, the suspect managed to get away despite having been shot. Meanwhile, the three remaining suspects were taken into custody and four firearms were found at the scene. On the morning of Thursday, Dec. 7, an 18-year-old with a gunshot wound arrived at a local hospital and was identified as the fourth remaining suspect. He was treated and then arrested. The four suspects arrested and charged in connection to the Dec. 6 shooting are: - Devone Brown, 18, of Richmond: Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon - Corey Hewitt, 21, of Chesterfield County: Possession of a concealed weapon and possession of a firearm with an extended magazine - Kemonte Mayo, 18, of Henrico County: Outstanding Henrico County arrest warrants for strangulation, simple assault, and destruction of property - Calique Harris, 18, of Richmond: Attempted murder and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony in connection to the shooting Dana Schrad, the executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, said there has been an uptick in attacks on law enforcement officers. “We’ve had several [officers shot] in the Richmond central area,” Schrad said. “We’ve had an additional officer severely injured out in Roanoke recently.” Even though in this case, the suspect’s gunfire missed the officer, Schrad said first responders can’t dodge every bullet — and the effects of a violent shooting on one’s mental state can last longer than a gunshot wound. “One of the things that often happens is we hear a report that the officer is in stable condition and people go, ‘Oh, good, he’s fine,’ or ‘she’s fine!’ Schrad said. “When, in fact, there is a lot of trauma associated with any kind of officer injury, whether it’s trauma to the officer, to the family, to the officer’s fellow officers and to the agency as a whole.” In accordance with the Richmond Police Department’s policy, the officer involved in the shooting has been placed on paid administrative leave. This incident is still under investigation and anyone with information is asked to call Major Crimes Detective M. Young of Richmond Police at 804-646-3926."

(WRIC) — Four men were arrested and charged after an officer-involved shooting in Southside Richmond. Richmond Police said officers were attempting to apprehend “known wanted individuals” who were inside a parked car in the 3100 block of Decatur Street just before midnight Wednesday, Dec. 6. As officers walked up to the car and tried to detain the wanted individuals, police said a man in the passenger seat fired shots at an officer, at which point the officer returned fire with his service weapon. The suspects inside the car then reportedly tried to run away, but three were caught and charged with the following: - Devone Brown, 18, of Richmond: Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon - Corey Hewitt, 21, of Chesterfield County: Possession of a concealed weapon and possession of a firearm with an extended magazine - Kemonte Mayo, 18, of Henrico County: Outstanding Henrico County arrest warrants for strangulation, simple assault, and destruction of property Police said the officers were unable to detain the man who had shot at the officer, but a short time later, a man — identified as Calique Harris, 18, of Richmond — arrived at a local hospital with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. Harris was treated and subsequently arrested and charged with attempted murder and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony in connection to the shooting. He was also served with an unrelated outstanding arrest warrant from Chesterfield County for contempt of court. Police said the officer who fired their gun was placed on paid administrative leave per department policy. Chief Rick Edwards and Command Staff, the Forensics Unit, Internal Affairs and Major Crimes detectives all responded to the scene. The investigation continues. Anyone with further information is asked to call Major Crimes Detective M. Young at 804-646-3926."

(WRIC) — A new report detailing the number of officers shot in the line of duty is hitting too close to home for the greater Richmond area. The National Fraternal Order of Police released its monthly statistics on police shootings, which say that 350 police officers have been shot so far this year. Virginia has had seven officers shot so far in 2023. Four of those shootings happened since Oct. 25 in central Virginia. The total number of officers shot in Virginia in 2022 was 9. Cliff Lent, the president of security consulting company M7 Solutions, weighed in on the report’s findings. “The numbers are concerning. And they hit home. Having served for 24 years in a police department, I understand the dangers of the job. But to see fellow officers being shot at that rate is alarming,” Lent said. “It’s indicative of a breakdown in society and in a willingness to shoot at the police. And those numbers are pretty consistent not just this year, but in recent years. And there’s been an uptick in that kind of those attacks on police.” The 4 most recent incidents happened in central Virginia: - A woman was arrested for allegedly shooting a federal law enforcement officer during a barricade situation in Dinwiddie County - A special agent was grazed by a bullet while inside of an unmarked car in Petersburg - A Virginia State University campus police officer was shot and severely injured near the university’s campus - A Henrico County Division of Police officer was shot while responding to a robbery call in the Montrose area Lent said these recent shootings could potentially affect people who are considering becoming police officers. “I think it certainly gives them pause. Because the dangers are highlighted, you know, on the nightly news, when police are being shot almost on a daily rate throughout the country,” Lent said. He added that taking a moment to show appreciation goes a long way for people in jobs that put them at risk. “You can look at our public servants, whether it’s a teacher or a nurse or firefighter or police officer, and just remember to thank them for their service, because they handle situations that most of us don’t,” Lent said. Of the 350 officers shot in the line of duty this year nationwide, 42 were killed."

The new charges Thursday include three felonies and six misdemeanors. They come in addition to federal firearms charges in Delaware alleging Hunter Biden broke a law against drug users having guns in 2018. He had been previously expected to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges as part of a plea deal with prosecutors who said he failed to pay taxes on $4 million in personal income in 2017 and 2018. Defense attorneys have signaled they plan to fight any new charges. Desperation grows among Palestinians trapped with little aid as Israel battles Hamas in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) â Israeli forces struck the southern Gaza town of Rafah twice overnight, sowing fear in one of the last places where civilians can seek refuge. Israel has widened its offensive against Hamas from the devastated north to southern areas already packed with displaced people. United Nations officials say there are no safe places in Gaza. Heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis has displaced tens of thousands of people and cut most of Gaza off from deliveries of food, water and other vital aid. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres used a rarely exercised power to warn the Security Council of an impending âhumanitarian catastropheâ and urged members to demand a cease-fire. The United States appeared likely to block any such effort. Israel designates safe zone in Gaza. Palestinians and aid groups say it offers little relief MUWASI, Gaza Strip (AP) â Israel has designated a small slice of land along Gazaâs Mediterranean coast as a safe zone. It says waves of people fleeing the war can find protection from airstrikes and receive humanitarian supplies for their families there. But the reality? The area of Muwasi is a makeshift tent camp where thousands of dazed Palestinians live in squalid conditions in scattered farm fields and waterlogged dirt roads. Roughly 20 square kilometers (8 square miles) in southwest Gaza, Muwasi lies at the heart of a heated battle between Israel and international humanitarian organizations over the safety of Gazaâs civilians. Trump's vow to only be a dictator on 'day one' follows growing worry over his authoritarian rhetoric TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) â Donald Trump's assertion that he would only be a dictator on âday oneâ of a second term comes as he is facing growing scrutiny over his increasingly authoritarian and violent rhetoric. The consequences of that rhetoric were made clear following the deadly storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and after he tried to remain in power despite losing his 2020 reelection bid. The former president is now vowing vengeance and retribution as he runs again. He is outlining a second-term agenda marked by an unprecedented expansion of executive power and interference in the justice system, along with a massive civil service purge. House votes to censure Democratic Rep. Bowman for pulling a fire alarm in a Capitol office building WASHINGTON (AP) â The House has voted to censure Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman for triggering a fire alarm in a U.S. Capitol office building when the chamber was in session. The New York congressman Thursday became the third Democrat in the House to be admonished this year through the process. Censure is a punishment one step below expulsion from the House and has become routine in the last year. Republicans claim Bowman pulled the alarm in September to âcause chaos."" Bowman late Wednesday said he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and apologized for his mistake. The prominent progressive was surrounded by fellow Democrats, who criticized Republicans for what they called a âstupidâ resolution. UNLV gunman had list of targets at the university and 150 rounds of ammunition, police say LAS VEGAS (AP) â Police say the suspect in a deadly shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, had a list of targets at the school and at East Carolina University in North Carolina, where he once worked. Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Thursday that the suspect, identified as 67-year-old Anthony Polito, also had 150 additional rounds of ammunition before he was killed by police. Officials say three faculty members were killed and a fourth was wounded Wednesday. Authorities say that before the rampage, Polito had sent out 22 letters with no return address to university faculty members across the United States. The sheriff says police have contacted everyone on the suspectâs list, except for one person who was on a flight. Texas judge grants pregnant woman permission to get an abortion despite stateâs ban AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â A Texas judge has given a pregnant woman whose fetus had a fatal diagnosis permission to get an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to the stateâs ban that took effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. It was unclear Thursday how quickly or whether Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, will be able to obtain an abortion. State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble has granted a temporary restraining order allowing Cox to have an abortion. The state has not said if it plans to appeal. Cox is 20 weeks pregnant. Her attorneys say Cox went to an emergency room this week for a fourth time during her pregnancy. Trump appeals ruling rejecting immunity claim as window narrows to derail federal election case WASHINGTON (AP) â Former President Donald Trump is appealing a ruling that found he is not immune from criminal prosecution over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. That's according to court papers filed Thursday. Lawyers for the 2024 Republican presidential primary front-runner filed a notice of appeal indicating that they will challenge U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkanâs decision rejecting Trumpâs bid to derail the case headed to trial in Washington, D.C., in March. Trumpâs lawyers have asserted that he cannot face criminal charges because the actions spelled out in the indictment fell within his duties as president. Ospreys had safety issues long before they were grounded. A look at the aircraft's history WASHINGTON (AP) â When the U.S. military took the extraordinary step of grounding its fleet of V-22 Ospreys this week, it wasn't reacting just to the recent deadly crash of the aircraft off the coast of Japan. The aircraft has had a long list of problems in its short history. The Osprey takes off and lands like a helicopter, but can tilt its propellers horizontally to fly like an airplane. It's a unique and complex technology that has allowed it to deliver troops quickly to the battlefield. But that same technology has also been a factor in multiple incidents. There have been persistent questions about a mechanical problem with the clutch that has troubled the program for more than a decade. Centenarian survivors of Pearl Harbor attack return to honor those who perished 82 years ago PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) â Pearl Harbor survivor Ira Schab returned to the Hawaii naval base 82 years after Japanâs bombing propelled the U.S. into World War II. Schab was one of just five survivors at a remembrance ceremony for the more than 2,300 servicemen killed on Dec. 7, 1941. Six men had been expected, but one of the increasingly frail men wasn't able to attend. The aging pool of Pearl Harbor survivors has been rapidly shrinking. There is now one crew member of the USS Arizona still living. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doesnât have statistics for how many Pearl Harbor survivors are alive."

Fifty-seven-year-old Christopher Jordan died at his family home on Stella Street, Friday night. Police said Jordan approached a window “displaying a firearm toward the officers.” That’s when an officer shot and killed Jordan. Jordan’s sister was the one who called the police, saying he threatened her, but she never expected the response to end with her brother dead. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is now investigating, but the Jordan family and NAACP want the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division to do its own investigation. The NAACP said no one in the family saw Jordan with a gun and is calling the shooting unjustified. Lee County NAACP president, James Muwakkil, said it’s unacceptable that the standoff with police only lasted 45 minutes before deadly force was used against Jordan. Muwakkil said Jordan was not a violent person and was alone in the home, having a mental health crisis. He said a federal investigation must take place to see if the officer who pulled the trigger was justified or if this must be criminally investigated. “It was not enough time. We have seen these types of situations turn out to be peacefully, but it’s against a non-black person that it turns out to be peaceful,” Muwakkil said. Fort Myers Police Department said Jordan approached a window displaying a firearm toward an officer and was shot. Muwakkil said Jordan was not a violent person and was never known to have a weapon. “A mental health professional should have been the one doing the negotiation because they are trained to work [with] these types of people. He was a heavily drug abuser and a petty thief, but he was not known to even have had a fight in the neighborhood,” he said. To be clear, no police report has been released at this point, so whether there was or was not a gun still is unclear. What is clear is that Muwakkil wants a thorough investigation he, the family, and the community can trust. “No one was in danger or immediate harm. No one else was in the home at the time when the police arrived,” Muwakkil said. Muwakkil has advised Jordan’s family not to have him cremated until they’re able to communicate with the Department of Justice civil rights division. The family just submitted their report to them this week. Jordan’s family also plans on holding a press conference next Tuesday afternoon. WINK reached out to FMPD for a response but has not heard back."

The St. Paul Police Department said Thursday night during a news conference that the officer was responding to reports of a protection order that had been violated. Police said a woman called 911 and stated a man, identified as the suspect, was intentionally driving his vehicle into hers and had broken out one of the windows in her vehicle. She also stated he was in possession of a handgun. When the officer arrived in the area, he confronted the suspect, who then fired at the officer and hit him in the lower leg. The officer returned fire, critically injuring the suspect. The suspect was transported to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. The officer was also transported to the hospital but has since been released, police said. The woman was not believed to have been injured. Police added that the officer was wearing a body camera and that the footage will be reviewed by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He was placed on administrative leave as per protocol in an officer-involved shooting. The shooting remains under investigation by the MBCA."

Chief of Patrol John Chell told reporters the incident unfolded when two uniformed officers arrived at W. 177th Street and Haven Avenue in Washington Heights just before 3 a.m. to investigate numerous calls about a car crash or stolen vehicle. When the officers approached the car, which appeared to have been involved in an accident, Chell said the 19-year-old male driver jumped out, holding a gun and wearing a mask. Police later confirmed he fired at the officers. The officers fired eight shots, striking the man twice in the chest, Chell said. He was taken to NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem, where he underwent surgery and is expected to recover. A female passenger was unharmed, and has been cooperating with police, Chell said. After the shooting, Chell said police discovered a note inside the car, indicating the man wanted to commit suicide because of âvarious things going on in his life.â âHe also apologized to cops for what was about to happen,â in the note, Chell said. The officers were also taken to a local hospital, though itâs unclear what injuries they sustained, according to police. On Sunday, police shot and killed 38-year-old Courtney Gordon after responding to a call from a teen in Far Rockaway that her âcousin was killing her family.â The officers shot Gordon after they say he lunged at them and stabbed them both with the knife he had used to kill four of his relatives. Police said the investigation remains ongoing. The name of the man has not yet been released. This story has been updated to reflect that police say the 19-year-old man fired at officers."

Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill confirms the gunman was Anthony Polito, 67, of Henderson. McMahill says all of the victims were faculty members and were found inside Beam Hall. Cha-Jan ""Jerry"" Chang and Patricia Navarro Velez have been identified as two of the three victims killed. McMahill says the third victim killed will not be identified until the Clark County Coroner's Office can notify their next of kin. Polito was armed with a 9mm handgun and 11 magazines. Police found nine loaded magazines on him after the shooting. The gun was bought legally last year, and McMahill says it's still unknown how many rounds he fired. Detectives learned that Polito went to a post office before the shooting and sent 22 letters to universities around the country. Police also recovered what they believe to be a ""last will and testament""-style document from his apartment, McMahill said. McMahill says Polito applied to several higher education institutions in Nevada and was rejected each time. Investigators believe he was struggling financially and acted alone. McMahill says that in a screening of the envelopes that were intercepted, the first one opened yielded an ""unknown white powder substance."" Anyone in the world of academia who receives a letter with no return address is asked to use caution and contact law enforcement. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department later confirmed that the substance inside the envelopes was found to be harmless, according to the post on X. READ MORE | What we know about suspected gunman in deadly UNLV shooting McMahill says they are working to contact the recipients of those letters. The contents of other letters are unknown. Polito also had a list of people at UNLV and Eastern Carolina University, and police have contacted all but one person, who is on an international flight. McMahill asks anyone who might have information or video of the shootings to contact LVMPD's homicide section or Crime Stoppers at (702) 385-5555. Dr. Keith Whitfield, president of UNLV, says he thanks the police officers who rushed to the scene. He credits them for stopping a larger tragedy from happening. Adam Garcia, head of University Police Services, said the first officer on the scene was there within 78 seconds of the initial call. Two university police detectives shot and killed Polito, and Garcia said they were heroes. An exclusive video given to News 3 reveals law enforcement cleaning up inside the Student Union at UNLV. Officers are seen putting up caution tape on broken glass doors. The effort comes after LVMPD reported a shootout between the suspect and university detectives outside of the Student Union where the shooter was shot dead, ending the threat. Clark County Commission Chair Jim Gibson urges anyone who might be affected to contact the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center. The county is also in talks with UNLV and the Resiliency Center to accept donations in response to the shooting. Clark County Fire Chief John Steinbeck says the Resiliency Center will be available when needed. He notes that some people affected by One October reached out to the center years later. Steinbeck said the flow of information will always be a challenge. He says there is a joint information center, but there's still so much information that initial reports had the victim count much higher than later determined. UPD will identify the officers who shot and killed Polito on Friday, in keeping with the protocol for officer-involved shootings. Of the 22 letters LVMPD is aware of, McMahill says he believes all of the intended recipients have been contacted. Garcia with University Police says they are reviewing how many people are assigned to each campus. They are leaning on local partners to help provide added security measures at other institutions like CSN and Nevada State University. Speaking about a petition to be a closed campus, UNLV President Whitfield says they will take a look at it, but other presidents he's spoken with do not believe closing a campus would be a deterrent and it's not his inclination. ""We're Las Vegas's university"", he says. Asked if Polito had additional plans for violence, McMahill says he believes Polito could have been headed to the Student Union. There's still more information that needs to be investigated, he says. The LVMPD Homicide Section is seeking the public for assistance in the ongoing investigation.

In a media briefing this morning near the scene, Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said a pursuit of a stolen vehicle near 91st and Silver Spring ended when the vehicle in question crashed into a light pole near 51st and Hampton. “Early information indicates that one of the suspects was carrying a visible firearm, and refused to drop the weapon despite multiple verbal commands from the police.” said Norman Thursday. Multiple shots were then fired in the 4800 block on North 51st Street. A 19-year-old Milwaukee male is now in critical condition, while a 22-year-old Milwaukee male was also transported to the hospital with minor injuries. The identities of the officers involved are not known, other than that they are 26 and 27-year-old males with a combined 10 years of service with the Milwaukee Police Department. It’s unclear if the suspects threatened the officers with the firearm. Milwaukee Police released the following statement on the incident: On Thursday, December 7, 2023, at approximately 3:17 a.m., Milwaukee Police officers observed a stolen vehicle wanted in connection with a shooting and attempted to stop the vehicle at 91st and Silver Spring. The vehicle did not stop and a vehicle pursuit ensued. Officers deployed stop sticks at 68th and Hampton in an attempt to stop the vehicle. The vehicle crashed at 51st and Hampton and two occupants in the vehicle fled. A foot pursuit ensued. Early information indicates that one of the suspects was carrying a visible firearm and refused to drop the weapon despite multiple verbal commands from police. At approximately 3:22 a.m., multiple shots were fired in the 4800 block of North 51st Street. A firearm was recovered in close proximity to a suspect at the scene. The suspects are a 19-year-old Milwaukee male, who was transported to a local hospital for treatment of critical injuries, and a 22-year-old Milwaukee male who was transported to a local hospital for treatment of minor injuries.Â The officers involved in this incident are a 26-year-old male with 8 years of service and a 27-year-old male with two (2) years of service.

The organization has had an immense impact on the Upstate and the entire state in recent years. Kassy Alia Ray is the founder and CEO of Serve and Connect. Her personal connection behind why the organization was started allows her to share perspective with law enforcement who are critically injured and the families of those in law enforcement who were killed. “It’s an organization I founded after my husband Greg, who was a police officer with the city of Forest Acres in the Columbia area, was shot and killed in the line of duty on Sept. 30, 2015,"" Alia Ray said. ""In the aftermath of losing Greg, it really magnified my grief, and I felt called to find a way to be a part of creating healing and change.” Alia Ray said she was 28 at the time she lost her husband. The two had just welcomed their first child six months prior. ""When Greg was killed, on top of losing my best friend, the love of my life and the father of my child, I also had the very real fear of how I'd survive,"" Alia Ray said. ""Here I was a 28-year-old single mother with a baby. I was a graduate student at the time. The fear of how we'd get by was very real and present. Because of the community support, it helped me to be able to grieve in peace and build up these broken pieces of our lives back together."" Serve and Connect, known at the time as Heroes in Blue in March of 2016, launched its first fundraising tragedy response campaign following an Upstate line of duty death. ""Officer Allen Jacobs with the Greenville Police Department had been shot and killed, leaving behind his little boys and his pregnant wife behind,"" Alia Ray said. ""We raised over $193,000 that went to support his family.” Since then, Serve and Connect has been a part of at least 30 fundraising tragedy response campaigns since it was founded, including the ongoing fundraiser for Oconee County Deputy Lucas Watts. Watts was shot and critically injured in the line of duty, back in November after a traffic stop. ""We have raised over $1.3 million,"" Alia Ray said. ""One hundred percent of which has gone back to the family of officers who are killed or critically injured in the line of duty in South Carolina.

Steve Mylett, the Akron chief of police, found that the officerâs actions during the fatal encounter were âobjectively reasonable.â His ruling came on November 29, more than a year after Jaylan Walker was gunned down by police during a traffic stop on June 27, 2002. The decision to clear the cops was already signed, sealed, and delivered to the anger of some. On April 17, 2023, a special grand jury in Ohio declined to indict the Akron police officers after a car chase and foot chase last year. The grand jury concluded the officers were legally justified in their use of force against Jayland Walker, according to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. Following the shooting, Walker was put in handcuffs by police and was found with his hands cuffed behind his back when EMTs arrived on the scene. According to police, officers attempted to administer first aid to Walker after he was shot many times. Walker was pronounced dead at the scene. Police shot Walker 17 times in his pelvis. One bullet struck his face and fractured his jaw. Eight gunshot wounds injured his arms and his right hand. Five gunshot wounds injured his knees, right lower leg, and right foot, according to Lisa Kohler, MD, the Summit County Medical Examiner. No firearm was found on or near Walker’s body, though the cops on the scene all claimed that they saw him reach for a weapon or for what they assumed was a weapon. No illegal drugs were found in his body. The Summit County Medical Examinerâs Office ruled his death a homicide seven months after the deadly shooting. Eight cops, including a Black officer, fired 94 shots within 6.7 seconds at Jayland Walker. Three cops fired 18 shots each. But the deadly shootings complied with the departmentâs rules, said Police Chief Mylott. Walker worked as a delivery driver when police stopped him for a traffic violation because his license plate was broken. Gun residue shows he did not have a gun in his hands. A gun was found in his car near his wedding ring. The Summit County Medical Examinerâs Office ruled his death a homicide. Police killings over minor traffic violations has become routine by cops. Police often argue that low-level stops and the searches they conduct during those stops allow them to root out dangerous crimes by identifying guns and drugs. However, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, data shows that searches that begin with traffic stops seldom yield contraband. Encounters with police during traffic stops, including minor infractions, disproportionately harm people of color, according to data collected by Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research group, which argues that armed police should not be involved in the majority of these cases. Community organizations want the U.S. Justice Department to investigate Walker’s murder. Walkerâs family has filed a $45 million lawsuit against the city of Akron and the police department. The cops involved in Walker’s murder are back on duty."

The shooting happened at Cretin and Marshall avenues just after 2 p.m., after a woman called 911 to report a man whom she has an order for protection against was following her. They were in separate vehicles and she was trying to drive away from him. The woman reported the man was intentionally driving his vehicle into her, that he was armed with a handgun and he’d broken out a window of her vehicle, said Sgt. Mike Ernster, a St. Paul police spokesman. The man was driving a blue Chevrolet Impala and the woman was in a silver van, according to emergency radio dispatches. A St. Paul officer confronted the man and the man shot him in the lower leg, Ernster said. The man shot by the officer has life-threatening injuries. It was “a scary day for St. Paul,” Mayor Melvin Carter said at a Thursday evening press conference. “One of the most scary calls that a mayor can receive is that an officer has been injured by gunfire. … We are all breathing a sigh of relief that our officer is recovering. We are in prayer alongside the families of the involved individual. And we are committed, just like we are in any incident involving an officer-involved shooting, to the highest levels of transparency and accountability.” The intensity of the situation in the Merriam Park neighborhood could be heard over the police radio as an officer relayed, “Officer shot, officer shot!” The wounded officer shouted over the emergency radio: “The next squad that pulls up, you’re taking me to Regions!,” which is what happened. Hospital staff was waiting for him. He was treated and had been released from the hospital as of Thursday night. Paramedics transported the injured man to Regions Hospital. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating. The officer who shot the man was wearing a body camera and the BCA will review the video as part of its investigation. The officer will be placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice. The woman was not injured, though Police Chief Axel Henry drew attention Thursday to domestic violence and noted there have been six such homicides in St. Paul this year. “Our officers get called to these situations — when they’re asked for help, they’re going to respond,” he said. “No one in our community, particularly our officers, wants things to turn out this way.” The police union said the officer is “doing well.” “There are heroes among us,” said Mark Ross, St. Paul Police Federation president. “He’s one of them.” The last time an officer was shot in St. Paul was in 2015 when an officer was wounded in the face by a man who fired an air-pellet gun. The time before that occurred in 2012 when a St. Paul officer was shot in the back and saved by his bullet-resistant vest, but another blast from a shotgun shredded his arm. The previous shooting by a St. Paul officer was in February, when Yia Xiong was killed in a hallway outside his apartment near West Seventh Street. The BCA has said Xiong, 65, was holding a 16-inch knife. His family and community members have been waiting for prosecutors to make a charging decision, and they’ve said they want the officers involved to be charged."

Things have gone downhill since then, driven by presidential defeats in 2008 and 2012, and former President Donald Trump's false insistence that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Now, that trust number is reversed. Just 22% of Republican voters have high confidence that votes in 2024 will be counted accurately, according to a June poll by the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center. That means it's extremely difficult (though not impossible) to be a viable GOP candidate in a statewide or national primary race without at least nodding to the possibility of election shenanigans. And candidates in the Republican presidential primary have generally gotten the memo, though each has found a different way to tap into those election anxieties. Here's where the current notable presidential hopefuls, including Trump, stand on issues of democracy and election integrity. Donald Trump Trump, who sought to overturn an election loss and has said he'd punish his political foes if returned to power, is an antidemocratic force in U.S. politics. Dating back more than a decade, Trump worked to undermine trust in America's election systems (a tactic of authoritarian regimes). 2020 supercharged his voting falsehoods. States turned to more mail voting in response to the COVID pandemic, and Trump used the powers of the presidency to try to restrict access to that voting method. He then seized on those changes to falsely claim the system was rigged against him when he lost, and he set into motion a plan to try to stay in power against the will of the voters, leading to multiple criminal indictments. He asked state officials to ""find"" votes and to stop counting rightfully cast ballots in order to help him. Importantly, Trump's election claims were not only bogus, but federal prosecutors allege he almost certainly knew they were untrue and continued to spread them even as some fellow Republicans worried about the unrest and violence that could follow. In the time after voting ended, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney General William Barr investigated the many voter fraud claims the president was pushing and concluded there was nothing to them. On the day electoral votes were set to be counted in the U.S. Capitol, a violent mob of Trump's supporters overtook the building, leading to a woman being shot by police, and more than 100 police officers injured. ""We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,"" Trump told the crowd gathered at the Ellipse, before they marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. Trump has defended his actions that day, and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. But in the time since, Trump has only doubled down on his false and antidemocratic rhetoric. Late last year, he posted online that ""massive fraud"" like what he claims happened in 2020 should allow ""the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution."" â Miles Parks Ron DeSantis For long after the 2020 election, DeSantis dodged questions about Trump's false election fraud claims and washesitant to recognize Joe Biden's win. That is, untila few months ago, when he said ""of course"" Trump lost. In the years DeSantis didn't weigh in on the 2020 election, though, he oftensupported candidates who denied the results of the election. As Florida governor, DeSantis has signed a slew of restrictive voting bills that he says protect election integrity but that voting rights advocates say disenfranchised thousands of voters â and most affectedBlack Floridians. In 2018, Florida voters approved a ballot measure restoring voting rights to most Floridians with a prior felony conviction. But before the measure went into effect, DeSantissigned legislation requiring these individuals to fulfill every part of their sentence, including paying any fees or fines, before getting their voting rights back. However, the state has yet to create any sort of database of how much these individuals owe. As a result, advocates say thousands of Floridians havenot had any clarity on how or when they can get their rights back. Last year, DeSantis pushed for a new state agency that specifically investigates election crimes. The office's first arrests werevery controversial. In a big press event, DeSantis announced the statearrested roughly 20 people who voted in 2020 who were not eligible to regain their voting rights after a felony conviction. Many of these individuals say they believed they were able to vote because election officials gave them voter registration cards, and attorneys representing some of them haveaccused the state of entrapping their clients. Both in 2021 and this year, DeSantis has signed legislation creating more mail voting restrictions. This year's law also placed new rules on third-party voter registration groups, which historically have been a key way people of color in Florida have registered. â Ashley Lopez Nikki Haley The former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor has been publicly critical of Trump's actions after losing the 2020 election. ""Many of his actions since the election were wrong and will be judged harshly by history,"" Haley wrote in a 2021 Wall Street Journal op-ed. NBC News reported that a voter at an Iowa event in May asked Haley how she would make sure there's a ""fair and speedy"" trial for those charged in the Jan. 6 attack. According to NBC, Haley replied, ""I don't know enough about each individual [rioter] but that's my rule: If you break the law, you pay the price."" Still, Haley has emphasized that she is ""proud of the successes of the Trump administration."" And while she has acknowledged Biden's victory in 2020, Haley has also supported the campaigns of Republicans who have cast doubt on the election results, including Adam Laxalt, the former Nevada state attorney general who lost a Senate race; and Don Bolduc, the retired U.S. Army general who lost a Senate race in New Hampshire. Haley's campaign website describes her as a ""vocal advocate for voter ID,"" and she often highlights the risk of voter fraud in elections, despite proven voter fraud being exceedingly rare. ""In the America I see, everyone has full confidence in our elections. Voter ID will be the law of the land just like we did in South Carolina,"" Haley said at her campaign kickoff speech in February. â Hansi Lo Wang Vivek Ramaswamy Prior to his presidential run, Ramaswamy criticized Trump's actions after his 2020 election defeat. In his 2022 book, Nation of Victims, Ramaswamy called Jan. 6 ""a dark day for democracy"" and labeled Trump a ""sore loser"" who pushed ""weak"" claims of election fraud. Republicans, he wrote, had ""placed grudges about elections at the core of party identity."" More recently, however, candidate Ramaswamy has leaned into those sorts of grudges. During Wednesday night's primary debate, he repeated several conspiracy theories, including that Jan. 6 appears to be ""an inside job"" and that the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from Trump by Big Tech platforms that he has alleged interfered through their censorship. Ramaswamy has proposed far-reaching, if implausible, reforms to voting policies. When asked on NBC's Meet the Press how he would've handled Vice President Mike Pence's role on Jan. 6, Ramaswamy said he would've used the ""historic opportunity"" to pass sweeping measures such as ""single-day voting on Election Day,"" thereby eliminating early and mail voting options, and federal voter identification rules. ""In my capacity as president of the Senate, I would have led through that level of reform, then on that condition certified the election results, served it up to the president â President Trump â then to sign that into law,"" he said. Conditioning the transfer of power on the passage of radical and restrictive voter reforms would likely not have found many fans among Democrats in Congress. Ramaswamy's most unique proposal is what he calls ""civic duty voting."" It's a constitutional amendment that would increase the U.S. voting age from 18 to 25, apart from those who serve at least six months in the military or as a first responder, or pass a civics test. While critics note it would disenfranchise tens of millions of U.S. citizens, Ramaswamy defends his plan in part by quoting the ""IKEA effect,"" in which ""psychologists have found people put greater value in things that they have to work for or invest in."" â Benjamin Swasey Chris Christie Christie, a former Trump ally, has in recent years explicitly and repeatedly condemned the former president for his false claims about the 2020 election. ""You can't undercut our democracy with no facts,"" Christie told CNN in 2021, explaining his break with Trump. Christie has said Trump's attempts to overturn his election defeat should disqualify him from holding the Oval Office again, and Christie, a former federal prosecutor, told the NPR Politics Podcast in September that the special counsel's federal election subversion case against Trump is an ""absolutely appropriate [case] to have been brought."" Christie was a two-term governor of New Jersey in the 2010s, and during his tenure vetoed a few Democratic-backed voting bills. One was a 2016 automatic voter registration measure, and during a news conference, Christie reportedly referred to the proposal as a ""cocktail of fraud."" In 2018, now-Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation to establish automatic voter registration, and there's been no proven widespread voter fraud associated with the state's system since then. â Benjamin Swasey Copyright 2023 NPR.

It was held at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Christi was the only one who warned against allowing Donald Trump to return to the White House because of his plans to end democracy and elections and become a dictator for life. Christi, Ramaswamy and DeSantis got into several arguments with Christie. They refused to answer yes or no to whether they believed Trump is fit to hold office. Christie also defended Haley when Ramaswamy and DeSantis lashed out at her. Las Vegas shooting: CNN reported this morning that it learned the gunman who killed three people at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas yesterday was a professor who had worked in North Carolina and had been turned down for a job at the University of Nevada. CNN said it was told the shooter, who was killed by police, was identified as Anthony Polito. Police had not released information about the shooter nor had they released information about the shooting victims as of this morning. Texas shooting spree: Police in Austin, Texas, say that it was one man who killed six people in different locations between Austin and San Antonio. They identified the shooter as 34-year-old Shane James, a San Antonio resident, who has been arrested. Police said two of the victims were his parents. James shot and wounded a police officer who confronted him. He fled and was captured after a police chase. Police said he has a history of mental illness and had previously been arrested on charges of assaulting family members. Russian attacks on civilians: The U.N. Security Council has been told by U.N. officials that Russia is stepping up its attacks on Ukrainian civilians and is attempting to wipe out infrastructure needed by civilians to handle the approaching Ukrainian winter. The officials said that millions of Ukrainians are facing winter without access to heat, electricity and running water. U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood pointed out that Russia engaged in infrastructure attacks last winter. Russia’s Deputy Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky said that the western nations held the Security Council meeting just to spread invective against Russia. Fake electors: Ten Republicans in Wisconsin who acted as fake electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election have a settled a lawsuit filed against them that was seeking at least $2.4 million in damages. They admitted that what they did was improper and agreed to never again be electors in an election where Donald Trump is running. Lawsuits against Trump attorneys Kenneth Chesboro and Jim Troupis in the Wisconsin fake electors matter continue. One of the fake electors who settled is Andrew Hitt, who was the Republican Party chairman in Wisconsin. He has been cooperating with the Justice Department. Israeli tank: The news agency Reuters reported this morning that its investigation has determined that an Israeli tank fired two shells that killed one of its reporters and wounded six other reporters. Reuters said that the reporters had been in a small town in Lebanon near the border with Israel when the tank opened fire. Reuters called on Israel to explain how the incident could have happened.

In a release, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said under the circumstances it was reasonable for Fazio and Lair to believe the victim, David Wood, and possibly themselves were in imminent danger of being killed or seriously injured. According to a release from the office, Fazio and Lair responded to the 2441 Waneka Trail at approximately 2:50 a.m. on Oct. 22 in reference to a “psychotic event” that was reported by David Wood, the father of Sean Wood. Upon arrival, Fazio and Lair found the father and son on the front lawn of the residence and reported that Sean Wood was armed with two knives. The officers drew their service weapons, according to the release, and Fazio demanded that Wood “drop the knife right now!” According to the release, Sean Wood then ran at his father and stabbed him a total of seven times as the officers continued to demand he drop the weapon. Fazio then fired his gun three times in quick succession, according to the release, which was followed by two shots fired by Lair in quick succession. Fazio and Lair’s shots were fired within one second of each other and the shots were fired nine seconds after they arrived on scene, according to the release. Sean Wood then collapsed to the ground but did not let go of the knives. His father was moved to a confined location and Fazio is then heard saying to Sean Wood, “Drop the knife dude. Throw the knife. I want to help you.” According to the release, Sean Wood then dropped one of the knives and Fazio kicked it away while Lair drew his taser. Then, after observing Wood had a second knife which he moved from his left hand to his right hand, Wood began attempting to stab himself in the chest, the release said. Six more commands were given for him to stop, however after Wood disregarded them, Fazio ordered Lair to “tase him.” The taser was effective and the two approached Wood before Lair took the second knife from Wood’s hands. While prying away the knife, Lair is reported to have tased Wood again. Aid was then rendered to both Sean Wood and his father. According to the release, both sustained serious injuries. “The Critical Incident Team conducted a thorough and independent investigation, which is important in these situations,” Dougherty said in the release. “Based on my office’s review of that investigation, each of the law enforcement officers was justified in using force to save Mr. Wood’s life. They moved quickly and bravely in response to the serious threat and immediately rendered medical aid to both the father and son. It is a sad case; it is fortunate no one died that night.” Sean Wood, 22, is charged with attempted first-degree murder — after deliberation; first-degree assault with use of a deadly weapon; second-degree assault causing serious bodily injury; felony menacing; third-degree assault — knowingly or recklessly causing injury; and violent crime with the use of a weapon. Sean Wood is currently out of custody on a $10,000 surety bond posted by his father. He is set to appear for a preliminary hearing on Feb. 5. According to the release, Sean Wood is observed on Ring footage arriving at the residence at 2:30 a.m. Oct. 22. Over the course of eight minutes, he is observed pacing toward and away from a gun safe in the garage. Sean is then observed entering the home unannounced and is greeted by his father, who lives there alone. According to the release, a couple minutes later, David Wood is seen on Ring footage entering the garage saying, “you’re scaring me,” before Sean tells him he needs to see his dad open the safe so he knows it’s him. David refuses to open the safe to which Sean says his dad is a liar and he’s going to have to kill him. Sean continues to act abnormally, including challenging his father to a fight, pushing his father down the garage stairs and stating, “you’re not me and you’re just a (expletive) machine,” which prompts David to call 911. During the investigation, it was determined around the same time David called 911, his son grabbed two knives from the kitchen. According to the release, Sean told his father he had to “kill himself to get out” before attempting to stab himself in the leg. His father attempted to stop him which led David to sustain stabbing injuries to the arm and forehead. According to online court records, Sean had a blood alcohol content of 0 at the time of his arrest. Sean has no criminal history in Boulder County. Dougherty will host a town hall via Microsoft Teams at 1 p.m. on Tuesday regarding the officer-involved shooting investigation. Questions should be submitted in advance to boulderda@bouldercounty.gov. Attendants can join by calling 720-400-7859 or via https://bit.ly/LafayettePDOISTownHall."

An indictment was handed up on Wednesday for 40-year-old Jerry Moravek, of Paterson, who faced second-degree charges of aggravated assault and official misconduct, according to state Attorney General Matthew Platkin and the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability. The charges were initially announced last winter by Platkin’s office, which also released some body camera footage of the incident in June 2022. ’Drop the gun’ shouted during chase Moravek was among police who responded to a noise complaint around 3:20 a.m. on June 11, 2022, where several people were gathered out on the street. In the footage released, Moravek is heard checking in with fellow officers to be sure they are safe and asking about a firearm that had been secured when several shots are heard. As Moravek starts running toward the area, yelling ""shots fired,"" a man comes running past him. The officer turns to chase him, yelling "" drop the gun"" several times, though no weapon is seen. Read More: Paterson, NJ cop charged after wild 3 a.m. chase, shooting No other orders are shouted, state prosecutors have pointed out, before Moravek shoots his service weapon, striking 28-year-old Khalif Cooper, of Paterson, in the back. He has not been publicly identified by the state but has been named in various other reports on the incident. Bullet fragments lodged in his spine have left Cooper unable to walk. No gun was found in the man’s possession or within his reach — though one was recovered around the corner, along the path where he had run. Right after he was shot, Cooper tells Moravek he has no gun and was running because he was afraid. 🔷 Deadly force ‘not justified’ in this case, grand jury finds “Police officers in New Jersey and around the country put their lives on the line every day and routinely exercise sound judgment, using force only when justified,” Platkin said in a written statement on Thursday. “Deadly force against a fleeing suspect must be used only when absolutely necessary to stop an imminent danger. As alleged, the grand jury determined that the defendant’s decision to use deadly force against the victim running away from him in this incident was not justified.” State law enables police officers to only use deadly force against a suspect when immediately necessary to protect the officer or another person from imminent danger. Deadly force can only be used against a fleeing suspect in the rare situation when the suspect would pose an imminent danger to public safety if he were not immediately caught and stopped. If convicted of either second-degree charge, Moravek could face five to 10 years in state prison and a fine of up to $150,000. 🔷 Paterson police overseen by NJ since March In March, the Attorney General's Office took over authority of the Paterson police force, saying the department has faced a ""crisis of confidence"" after several police-involved shootings in recent years and other scandals. Cooper had previously pleaded guilty to two separate gun crimes in 2016 and 2017, according to court records cited in a Paterson Press report in February. In the same report, Paterson Black Lives Matter leader Zellie Thomas said Cooper’s criminal record involving guns should not be a factor in the ongoing case involving his paralysis. 🔷 Lawyer: Moravek believed his life and others were at risk Defense attorney Patrick Caserta previously released a statement about Moravek's actions, saying that after he heard gun shots and saw a man running, ""His first reaction was that the person might be a victim who needed help but as he approached the man, that person ran past and away from him. It was then that Officer Moravek saw that he had a handgun. Did this person fire those shots? Did he just shoot or kill someone? Regardless, it was Officer Moravek’s duty to pursue and apprehend that person even though it clearly meant he would be risking his own life."" Caserta continued, ""During a short foot chase, there came a time when Officer Moravek believed his life and the life of other people in the street was at risk. He believed at that split-second that the person he was chasing was turning to fire that handgun at him and he realized that if he missed, the bullets could strike anyone nearby. He made that split-second decision and fired his weapon."" ""He shot twice. He stopped as soon as the threat was lessened. As the bodycam video previously released in this matter clearly show, Officer Moravek immediately went to the person to provide aid and he made repeated, urgent calls for EMS"" the lawyer also said, adding that ""It is also obvious from the bodycam video that Officer Moravek did not know the suspect had tossed the handgun a short distance away."" No definitive evidence collected has linked Cooper to the weapon in question, authorities have said.

The 19-year-old man, who had a young woman as a passenger, got into an accident on the service road of the Henry Hudson Parkway just before 3 a.m., NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell told reporters.Â Police responded, with one officer approaching the front passenger side of the car and the other walking up to the driver’s side. That’s when the driver “jumps out of the car in possession of a firearm,â Chell said. âOur officers defend themselves [and] have to discharge their firearms, strike the perp two times in the chest area.â The man was taken to a local hospital, where he was admitted for surgery and was expected to survive, Chell said.Â Inside the car — which may have been stolen — authorities found a handwritten suicide note that included an apology to the cops whom the disturbed driver expected to confront him, the police official said.Â âRight now, inside that vehicle, we do have a note indicating that the individual wanted to commit suicide — various things were going on [in] his life,â Chell said. âBut he also apologized to our cops for what was about to happen.â Two uniformed officers opened fire during the ordeal, and about eight rounds were fired, cops said.Â The woman who was inside the car with the teen was taken to a local precinct stationhouse, and has âgiven us some insight as to what happened here,â Chell said.Â âThe second time in four days, our cops respond to help people from their community, and are met with an immediate attack and they have to defend themselves,â the police official said, referring to another police shooting early Sunday in Queens. In that incident, an unhinged man, Courtney Gordon, 38, used a steak knife to butcher four of his relatives â including an 11-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy â and set their home ablaze before he injured two police officers and was shot dead by responding cops.

(AP) â A man featured in the hit podcast âS-Town"" that chronicled events in a rural Alabama community was shot and killed by police during a weekend standoff in the town, authorities said. Joseph Tyler Goodson, 32, of Woodstock, was shot by officers after he barricaded himself inside a home and âbrandished a gun"" at officers early Sunday, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. Bibb County Coroner Patrick Turner said that Goodson was pronounced âbrain deadâ Tuesday night at a hospital. The agency's statement said the Woodstock Police Department had initially responded to a âcall for serviceâ early Sunday and the standoff ensued. Multiple law enforcement agencies converged on the home. The statement said Goodson was shot by officers during the confrontation and was subsequently pronounced dead. The state agency did not describe what led to the initial call to the home. People are also reading… âPolice bout to shoot me down in my own yard,â a message posted early Sunday on Goodson's Facebook account read, news outlets, WIAT and al.com reported. The state agency is reviewing the shooting and will turn its findings over to the Bibb County district attorney. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said in a Monday press release that Goodson had been pronounced dead. However, the coroner said that two doctors at a hospital pronounced Goodson âbrain deadâ Tuesday night and he was being prepared for organ donation. The 2017 podcast, which won a Peabody Award, told the story of an Alabama man named John B. McLemore, who died by suicide before the show came out. McLemore's use of an expletive to describe his hometown gives the podcast its abbreviated title. âS-Townâ begins telling the story of a reputed killing and also another death and winds up focusing on the eccentric McLemore, a restorer of antique clocks, and his tortured relationship with the town of Woodstock. Several people in his life were also featured, including Goodson. âBecause you know, I ainât ever had no daddy worth a damn. Heâs just about the only daddy Iâve got,â Goodson said of McLemore in the the third episode of the podcast. Woodstock, with a population of about 1,500 people, is located about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of the major city of Birmingham. âI know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included,â Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement Monday. âTyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast. âPlease remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many,â the mayor added. Julie Synder, the executive producer of âS-Townâ declined to immediately comment when reached by email. Goodson in 2017 received a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to burglary and theft charges accusing him of taking items from McLemore's property after his death. Goodson, before pleading guilty, had maintained he was retrieving items that belonged to him. Goodson told The Associated Press in 2017 that the podcast had brought a deluge of attention on him and the town, but neither have done him any favors. âItâs a sad story, especially if youâre part of it,â Goodson said. This story has been updated to correct when Joseph Tyler Goodson was declared dead."

(WHNT) – A Decatur city council member is asking for a memorial to Stephen Perkins to be removed from city hall. As the Decatur community waits until the disciplinary hearing process for the officers involved in the shooting death of Perkins is completed. Councilman Hunter Pepper says that the signs are illegal and it’s time that they come down. On Monday night at the city council meeting Pepper faced a stiff line of questions from the Decatur community regarding his email to city employees that expressed his support for the officers involved in the fatal shooting. Pepper, never the one too shy from controversy, put in a request to the city’s attorney to have the Perkins memorial at city hall taken down while saying that the signs are a violation of city ordinances. In a statement to News 19, Pepper explained his position on the growing memorial saying: My stance on the signs, They are in violation of a city ordinance. I believe that we should follow the law and have them removed, however, after considering a few things, the signs may make a symbol of peace for the community but I do not believe it is helping, I believe individuals want the individuals names put out there so that they can be recognized and I can understand that, everyone is trying to heal. I hope that healing will be continued and that peace will be found within our community.Decatur Councilman Hunter Pepper Community leaders and supporters of the Perkins family are outraged as to why Pepper decided during time with the city on edge to make such a request. “Hunter Pepper, he is causing more trauma more pain and more hurt to this community and I feel as if his name should stop being mentioned when we’ve been up here day after day protesting and standing for justice,” Adrianna Tapscott of the organization Standing In Power said. Randy Gordon, president of the Morgan County NAACP, agrees with Tapscott. “This young man (Perkins) has been killed by police officers, just taken away from his family,” Gordon explained. “Because of his support for those officers Pepper can’t look at the Perkins picture on the building because his guilty conscious won’t let him look at it. So now he wants to take it down.” The Decatur city attorney says that removing the memorials is up to the discretion of Mayor Tab Bowling. Community leaders told News 19 that removing them would further shatter the community. Mayor Bowling said the goal continues to be to complete the determination hearings process on the discipline of the four officers involved in the shooting by the end of this work week. The mayor would not comment on the request for the removal of the memorial."

Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, who was elected months after the protests and said he would hold police accountable for their actions, said he would dismiss indictments against 17 officers but still move forward with prosecuting four others. The indictments followed nationwide protests in 2020 over racial injustice and police brutality; in Austin, police officers fired beanbag rounds in the crowd, critically injuring one teenager. Austin Mayor Kirk Watson said: âThis has been a difficult chapter for Austin. I look forward to turning the page. These announcements will allow police officers, whose lives were upended by the indictments, to return to their services to our community.” In a statement, Garza did his office âwould continue to hold law enforcement who break the law accountable,â and in a letter to the Justice Department, Garza asked prosecutors to review Austin policeâs use of force for crowd control during the protests. The City of Austin has paid out more than $18 million to settle lawsuits brought by protesters injured during the protests, including a college student who suffered brain damage after an officer shot him with a beanbag round. Eight other lawsuits are still pending, according to the city. Austin Police Association President Michael Bullock said prosecutors had yet to prove any case where any officer committed wrongdoing:Â âOur officers were faced with incredible and unprecedented challenges. In those extremely difficult times they acted within the law and upheld their oath to keep our city safe.” Editorial credit: Poli Pix Co. LLC / Shutterstock.com"

Two police officers and a cyclist were also shot and wounded but survived, said Austin interim Police Chief Robin Henderson. Police identified the suspect as Shane James, 34, of San Antonio. He was charged with capital murder following the incident, which started Tuesday morning and ended with James crashing his car that evening during a police pursuit. James has a history of mental health problems and a prior arrest on charges of assaulting family members, authorities said. His parents, Phyllis James, 55, and Shane James Sr., 56, were found dead in their home in the San Antonio area, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said at a news conference. Four more people were found dead in two homes in Austin, more than 80 miles away, officials said. The Austin victims were not immediately identified. A timeline provided by authorities revealed the wide ground the suspect allegedly covered between the attacks. Henderson said an Austin Independent School District police officer was shot in the leg around 10:45 a.m. Tuesday in a parking lot at Northeast Early College High School. Around noon, police responded to a home after getting calls about gunshots and found two people with signs of trauma. Police said one was dead and the other died at a hospital. Another shooting happened shortly before 5 p.m. when a male cyclist suffered non-life-threatening injuries. About two hours later, police responded to a call of a burglary in progress at another home and found two people dead there. Henderson didn’t say how those four people may have been killed. During the last call, an Austin police officer saw a man in the backyard. The man shot at the officer and the officer returned fire, Henderson said. The officer suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was taken to a hospital. The officer was listed in stable condition. The suspect was chased by police until he crashed at an Austin intersection. James’ parents were found dead after his arrest. Deputies who went to their residence saw water coming out of the home and forced their way inside, Salazar said. He said the deaths appeared to have occurred before the shootings in Austin. Austin ISD officer shot at Northeast ECHS AISD Police Chief Wayne Sneed said the sergeant who was shot is responsible for several campuses and was on his daily check of Northeast Early College High School when he was attacked. At about 10:40 a.m., he called to report he was taking on gunfire from someone and had been hit in the leg. At about 10:43 a.m., a school resource officer from the campus arrived to provide backup and assisted the injured sergeant. The campus went into lockdown at 10:46 a.m. About a minute later, APD and other agencies began arriving. Sneed said at least 15 agencies responded in total. The high school did a controlled release of its students due to the ongoing investigation, according to the district. Gov. Greg Abbott released a statement Tuesday afternoon sharing his reaction to the officer being shot in the line of duty. “Our hearts are with the family and loved ones of the Austin ISD police officer who was shot near Northeast Early College High School today,” Abbott said. “Our ISD police officers play a critical role on keeping Texas students and school faculty safe. The State of Texas is offering all available resources to local law enforcement partners who are working to ensure this dangerous criminal is caught and brought to justice. Cecilia and I ask our fellow Texans to join us in praying for the officer’s swift recovery and the entire Northeast Early College High School community.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Two of three people charged with arson in the burning of the Wendy’s restaurant in Atlanta where a police officer fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in June 2020 have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Chisom Kingston, Natalie White and John Wade were arrested on arson charges within weeks of the fire, which came in the midst of weeks of upheaval and protest across the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. A Fulton County grand jury in January 2022 indicted the trio on two counts each of first-degree arson and one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree arson. Kingston and White on Thursday pleaded guilty to the charges and each received a sentence of five years of probation, a $500 fine and 150 hours of community service to be completed with a nonprofit organization within the first year of probation, according to online court records. They were each sentenced under Georgia’s first offender law, meaning that if they complete their sentences without violating the terms or committing another crime, their records will be wiped clean. PHILADELPHIA MAN SENTENCED FOR ROLE IN OVERTURNING POLICE CAR DURING GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS Wade’s case was still pending. He was in federal prison in West Virginia after pleading guilty in February 2022 to a charge of conspiracy to burn U.S. Postal Service vehicles. Amanda Young, a lawyer listed for him in court records, declined on Tuesday to comment on his Fulton County case or his co-defendants’ plea deals. Khalil Eaddy, an attorney for Kingston, said his client is remorseful and is grateful to have this case behind him. “This is a good young man committed to his family and his community” Eaddy said in a press release Tuesday. “Since that night three years ago, he’s not only graduated from Georgia State University with plans to begin graduate school, he has kept the faith with our courts and with justice itself.” Drew Findling and Zack Kelehear, attorneys for White, said in a statement that their client resolved her case with a plea “after three years of litigation, on the eve of a specially set jury trial.” KYLE RITTENHOUSE WRITES BOOK TO CORRECT MISLEADING ‘NARRATIVE’: ‘TELL MY STORY’ The fast food restaurant was set ablaze during a protest on June 13, 2020, the night after a police officer fatally shot Brooks. Police had responded on June 12, 2020, to complaints that Brooks was asleep in his car in the restaurant’s drive-thru lane. Police body camera video shows the 27-year-old Black man struggling with two white officers after they told him he’d had too much to drink to be driving and tried to arrest him. Brooks grabbed a Taser from one of the officers and fled, firing it at the other officer as he ran. An autopsy found that Brooks was shot twice in the back. A special prosecutor appointed to examine the shooting last year announced that he would not seek charges against either officer involved, saying they acted reasonably. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Before he was shot, Brooks told officers three times that he had been with a girlfriend named Natalie White that night. Findling confirmed at the time that his client is the person Brooks was talking about but declined to comment further on their relationship, saying only that they were close."

(WAVY) — A Portsmouth jury visited Tatum Avenue Wednesday, six years after a police officer shot a burglary suspect three times. Judge William Shaw III, Senior Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Atty Haille Hogfeldt, Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Chris Warman and defense attorney Nick Renninger accompanied the 12 jurors. The group was not allowed to ask questions and was only able to spend about 15-minutes in the area of the 2017 shooting scene. Following the jury visit to the location, Officer Jeremy Durocher took the stand. The 37-year-old, who faces a malicious wounding and use of a firearm charge, now works for the Portsmouth criminal investigations unit. He joined the Portsmouth Police Department in December 2016 and is “here every day to protect the city.” About one year later, in October 2017, he was “walking into an unknown situation” when he was dispatched for a burglary call, Durocher told the jury. The officer said he saw the suspect, later identified as Deontrace Ward, “crouched down” in the back of the house with a “gun pointed at me,” adding that “I see an all-black handgun pointing at me.” Watching a frame-by-frame of his body camera video, Durocher explained that he was trained to use a gun if a suspect has a gun. “Without a doubt, he had a firearm in his hand,” he said. After yelling a command, Durocher said he fired two shots before Ward jumped the fence. “He was mere seconds away from running into other officers,” Durocher said. He then fired two more shots until Ward fell to the ground. He also said this was the first time he had ever fired his gun while on the police force. Durocher got emotional twice while on the stand. He explained that Ward had a gun and was an “active threat” to the other officers. However, on body camera video, Durocher is heard telling the other officers on scene that Ward “came out the window and had a gun pointed at me.” The prosecutor challenged Durocher’s recollection of the events, saying Durocher is heard twice saying he was scared. Warman asked Durocher several questions about the direction Ward was running and whether officers were on the other side of the fence in the direction Durocher was shooting. The prosecution team also zoomed in on the still frames to attempt to show the jury Ward’s hand while running and both of his hands on top of the fence. The defense rested following Durocher’s testimony as the courtroom was packed with police officers there to support him. During Wednesday’s proceedings, defense attorney Del. Don Scott motioned for a mistrial for the following reasons: - A juror was seen in a 2021 photograph with Tamara Shewmake, the chief administrator at the Portsmouth Commonwealth’s Attorney’s office and a member of the Portsmouth School Board. The two are a part of the same Greek letter organization. The juror said she doesn’t know her other than she’s on the school board. - Another juror told Judge Williams Shaw III she taught a witness 25 years ago. The two are Facebook friends. Scott asked for a mistrial, saying the jury pool is “tainted” and it is unfair to continue. Shaw decided to continue with the trial and jury pool. Closing arguments are expected to start Thursday morning. Follow 10 On Your Side’s Chris Horne for the latest."

The police shooting occurred Oct. 31 at a Chevron gas station at Garfield Avenue and Beverly Boulevard. In November, Long Beach police released video showing the moments leading up to a detective firing twice at Oscar Alejandro Ramires, 33, of Montebello — hitting him once in the upper body as he attempted to drive away after police surrounded him. Ramires rammed multiple civilian and police vehicles in the gas station, video shows. He had hit one undercover police SUV and one civilian SUV before the first shot was fired — a moment before the suspect hit the undercover minivan with the detective. The detective was knocked out through an open door after Ramires rammed it with his car. Ramires fled and hit another car on Via Altamira, with two occupants who were not injured, police said. Officers found him on the ground in a garage in the 600 block of the street, a block south of his home. Aside from identifying Ramires as a suspect wanted for attempted murder, police released no further details about that case. But a detective wrote in the court document that Ramires was identified as the suspect in a number of crimes, including the attempted murder of a woman Ramires, and other members of his gang, believed was going to testify against a gang member in an upcoming preliminary hearing. On Sept. 25, Ramires and another woman showed up in a car at a home in the 6000 block of Olive Avenue in Long Beach, police said. He fired four shots after the victim came to the front of the house, hitting her once in a leg, court documents show. Police initially arrested the woman during an investigation into a 2022 homicide but the District Attorney’s Office dropped the charges against her after she gave a statement to prosecutors against one of her co-defendants, the detective wrote. “Homicide detectives believe the … gang was targeting her for violence to prevent her from testifying,” police wrote in the search warrant. “This is based on multiple recorded jail calls, prison calls and social media posts.” Among the social media posts, the detective wrote, Ramires reposted one that appeared to be a $5,000 bounty targeting the woman. Before police say he shot her, Ramires was accused of pistol-whipping the woman and warning her against testifying, the detective wrote. The woman failed to appear in court and an arrest warrant was issued. The woman is now in protective custody. Police believe Ramires was also involved in a pair of car-to-car shootings in October after shell casings found at both scenes matched the markings of casings found from the shooting in the 6000 block of Olive Avenue, the detective wrote. Ramires has since been charged with attempted murder, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and dissuading a witness by force or fear, police said. He also faces a charge of assault on a peace officer and four counts of assault with a deadly weapon in relation to the Oct. 31 police shooting. He was being held in jail on more than $2 million bail, according to inmate records."

Austin Police identified the man Wednesday as Shane James, 34. Travis County Jail records show a man with the same name was booked into the jail at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday and was charged with capital murder of multiple people. James was arrested in connection with several homicides as well as the shootings of an Austin Independent School District officer and an Austin police officer, the Austin Police Department said early Wednesday morning. Based on the current state of the investigation, the deadly incidents in Austin appear to be random, the law enforcement source said. According to police, both officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries in Tuesday’s shootings. Interim Chief Robin Henderson said the department did not connect the shootings until after a shooting on Austral Loop in the Circle C neighborhood just before 7 p.m. Chief Henderson said the suspect is accused of killing two people on Shadywood Drive in south Austin and shooting an Austin Independent School District officer at Northeast Early College High School Tuesday morning. The Bexar County Sheriff’s Office also said a suspected double homicide near San Antonio is likely tied to the suspect as well. Below is the timeline of events as explained by Henderson early Wednesday morning. You can find further details of each incident further down in the article. - 10:40 a.m. – Austin ISD officer shot near Northeast Early College High School - 11:59 a.m. – Double homicide on Shadywood Drive - 4:57 p.m. – Cyclist shot on W. Slaughter Lane, non-life-threatening injuries - 6:54 p.m. – APD officer responds to active burglary on Austral Loop, finds suspect in backyard. Suspect fires at officer. Officer has non-life-threatening injuries. Suspect drives away. - 7:14 p.m. – Police chase ends with suspect crashing car Cyclist shot According to Chief Henderson, a bicyclist riding on West Slaughter Lane in South Austin reported being shot just before 5 p.m. The bicyclist had non-life-threatening injuries, the chief said. The man who is the suspect in the other shootings is a suspect in this shooting as well, the chief said. On Wednesday, police said the man was a 39-year-old man but did not release his name publicly. He has since been released from the hospital and recovering from his injuries, according to police. Austral Loop shooting An officer responding to a burglary call at a home on Austral Loop in the Circle C neighborhood in southwest Austin found the suspect in the backyard just before 7 p.m., Chief Henderson said. The chief told reporters that the suspect fired at the officer and the officer shot back but the suspect was not hit. Shortly afterward, the chief said, the officer reported he had been shot multiple times and the suspect got away. The chief said the officer is currently in stable condition. One law enforcement source told KXAN the officer shot suffered non-life threatening injuries. According to police on Wednesday, two victims were found inside the home and pronounced dead on the scene. Furthermore, police said the officer was released from the hospital and recovering from his injuries. Due to the investigation involving an officer in the shooting, police said it would release more details within 10 business days, per APD protocol. The suspect was chased by the police until he crashed at the intersection of State Highway 45 and FM 1826. Inside the home on Austral Loop, officers found two bodies. As of Wednesday afternoon, the president of the Austin Police Association told KXAN the officer injured had been seriously injured, but has been released from the hospital and was recovering at home. Austin ISD officer shot at Northeast ECHS AISD Police Chief Wayne Sneed said the sergeant who was shot is responsible for several campuses and went on his daily check of Northeast Early College High School Tuesday. At about 10:40 a.m., he called out to report he was taking on gunfire from someone and had been hit in the leg. That officer was later identified on Wednesday as Sgt. Val Barnes, who is currently in his supervisor role “supporting School Resources Officers.” According to AISD, Barnes was in stable condition and released from the hospital on Wednesday. At about 10:43 a.m., a school resource officer from the campus arrived to provide backup and helped the injured sergeant, later identified as Barnes. The campus went into lockdown at 10:46 a.m. About a minute later, APD and other agencies began arriving. Sneed said at least 15 agencies in total responded. The high school, which is near U.S. Highway 290, did a controlled release of its students due to the ongoing investigation, according to the district. Gov. Greg Abbott released a statement Tuesday afternoon sharing his reaction to the officer being shot in the line of duty. “Our hearts are with the family and loved ones of the Austin ISD police officer who was shot near Northeast Early College High School today,” Abbott said. “Our ISD police officers play a critical role on keeping Texas students and school faculty safe. The State of Texas is offering all available resources to local law enforcement partners who are working to ensure this dangerous criminal is caught and brought to justice. Cecilia and I ask our fellow Texans to join us in praying for the officer’s swift recovery and the entire Northeast Early College High School community.” APD investigating homicide in south Austin Around noon Tuesday, APD said it was investigating a homicide on Shadywood Drive, which is in the area east of South First Street and south of West William Cannon Drive. Officers said they found a man and a woman with “obvious signs of trauma to their body,” APD Sgt. Destiny Silva said during a media briefing. On Wednesday, police identified the man as Emmanuel Pop Ba, 32. The woman was identified as Sabrina Rahman, 24. Ba was pronounced dead on the scene. Rahman was taken to a local hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, according to police. According to police, one victim was pronounced dead on the scene. The other victim was taken to a local hospital, where they later died from their injuries. According to police, this is the 67th and 68th homicide in Austin. Bexar County homicide Additionally, the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office said in a media briefing that the suspect involved in the shooting spree may also be connected to a double homicide in Bexar County, which is near San Antonio. Sources confirmed to KXAN that the victims in the double homicide were the parents of the suspect. On Wednesday, Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement surrounding Tuesday’s events. The full statement can be read below. Texans grieve for the loved ones of the six Texans who were murdered by a hardened criminal who must never see the light of day again. The murderer also shot two law enforcement officers in the line of duty. Texas is a law-and-order state, and violence will never be tolerated. We thank all state and local law enforcement and first responders who apprehended this criminal and protected their communities. The State of Texas will provide all resources necessary to impose the full weight of law on this criminal for his despicable crimes. Cecilia and I ask our fellow Texans to join us in lifting up in prayer the families and loved ones of those who were killed, as well as the Texans who are recovering from injuries, including an Austin Police Officer and an Austin Independent School District police officer.Statement from Greg Abbott"

At issue is whether Sanchez reacted appropriately to the attack as he was being handed a sausage sample. Sanchez was holding his 22-month-old son when he was slugged by French, who a relative has described as a “gentle giant.” A witness is expected to testify that in the seconds after the punch, French had a “face of anger” and was in “a ready-to-fight posture,” Schwartz said. Body-worn camera video from Corona police played Wednesday showed Sanchez lying on the floor saying, “I see a blast and I feel my head get knocked down. I thought I was shot.” But French, a 32-year-old intellectually disabled man, was not armed. A doctor is expected to testify that Sanchez suffered a concussion. Sanchez is also charged with two counts of assault with a firearm causing great bodily injury for the wounds to the parents. Schwartz told jurors that Sanchez had “tunnel vision” focusing on French and that he didn’t see the parents rushing to protect and push away their son. Deputy Attorney General Mike Murphy, the prosecutor, told jurors that Sanchez panicked and failed to realize that he was no longer threatened after the punch. “This case is about a deadly overreaction,” Murphy said. “It was extremely reckless, unreasonable and unlawful. A witness will tell you it’s the quickest draw he had ever seen.” Sanchez, 33, has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. He is not in custody after posting bail. He faces 33 years in prison if convicted of all of the charges, Murphy said. During a morning break, Sanchez hugged supporters outside the courtroom. While the attorneys told jurors what they should expect to hear during the trial, there is information they will not learn from the testimony. Daniel Franc, a doctor with the Los Angeles Brain Science Project, examined Sanchez in 2021 and, after reading reports and witness statements, concluded Sanchez’s actions in the deli were reasonable in light of the head injury he suffered. “His perception of the person standing before him holding a gun is a reasonable split-second interpretation for an individual who had concussion/traumatic brain injury immediately prior to such perceptions,” Franc wrote in his report to the defense team. “Based on the available information and the effects of the concussion/mild traumatic brain injury, he made the reasonable decision as any other reasonable person in his specific circumstances, to use defense force to protect himself, his child and other members of the public. “Mr. Sanchez has recollections of the moments subsequent to his head trauma that are not consistent with aspects of the factual record,” Franc continued. “Corrupted memory and recall are expected after head injury due to temporary dysfunction of memory.” But after a series of motions on both sides, jurors will hear testimony from Franc only on the effects of concussions and that Sanchez suffered one. Franc will not be allowed by the judge to testify about the reasonableness of Sanchez’s actions, Schwartz said in an interview. Additionally, Russell French testified during the preliminary hearing that his son did not receive extensive mental-health treatment. But the number of medical records that Schwartz subpoenaed — and was largely denied — suggest otherwise, Schwartz said. Jurors will be told only that French has received mental-health treatment, Schwartz said. The state Attorney General’s Office is prosecuting the case after Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin declined to do so. Attorney General Rob Bonta concluded that Sanchez’s action as a police officer — shooting Kenneth French after French struck Sanchez — was not reasonable. That night, Sanchez, French, and his parents were standing in line for sausage samples in the deli of the Costco warehouse store on McKinley Street. Kenneth, who didn’t talk, lived with his parents in the Lake Hills area near Corona. Suddenly and unprovoked, Kenneth French slugged Sanchez in the back of his head as Sanchez held his son. Sanchez fell and struck his head on the floor. He told investigators that he thought he saw a “flash of light,” believed he had been shot and saw French, who was determined to be unarmed, holding a gun. A witness said he saw French facing Sanchez with clenched fists. In under four seconds after the punch, Sanchez pulled out his service revolver and began firing, despite Paola French shouting, “Don’t shoot!” Sanchez unleashed 10 shots, seriously wounding French’s parents and killing their son. A single, distant security camera recorded a short, blurry video that captured a portion of the confrontation. The tape did little to clarify the events. Sanchez identified himself as an officer to the arriving police, and he was not arrested. He was taken to Corona Regional Medical Center for treatment. On Wednesday, Paola French, 64, sobbed and cried through much of her testimony. She broke down answering prosecutor Murphy’s first question, “How many children do you have?” — prompting Superior Court Judge Jason L. Stone to briefly excuse the jury while French collected herself. She then said she had two children until Kenneth was killed. She sobbed again when Murphy played a video that shows her, Russell and Kenneth entering the warehouse store. She testified that she saw her son “move someone out of the way with his hand,” and then saw a man who said he was a police officer pointing a gun at them and firing. She used her right hand to mimic a gun and thrust it forward three times as she recalled first she being shot, followed by her husband and then her son. Russell French, 62, followed her to the witness stand. He said that after being shot, he tried to stay alive so there would be someone to testify about Sanchez’s actions. “If all of us died, this guy would have become a hero,” French said. When Murphy asked him about his many surgeries, French said, “I could become a priest. I’m like the Holy Father. I’ve got holes all around.” District Attorney Michael Hestrin handed the case off to the county grand jury, which, he explained, could subpoena witnesses who would not talk to his investigators. And, he said: “It was the type of case where the community needs to weigh in and draw the lines.” He denied he withheld prosecution to maintain favor with law enforcement. The Los Angeles Police Department fired Sanchez because officials determined that the shooting was not within policy. In October 2021, a federal jury awarded the Frenches $17 million after they filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Sanchez and the LAPD. The case is being heard in Indio because that was the only county courthouse where a courtroom was available for an anticipated monthlong trial, Schwartz said."

IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (KIFI) - The investigation into an officer-involved shooting continues in Idaho Falls. It happened early Monday morning and involved an Idaho State trooper and Idaho Falls police officers. The incident started when a trooper attempted a traffic stop. The driver shot at the officers causing the officers to shoot back. The suspect was killed. The Eastern Idaho Critical Incident Task Force is doing the investigation with Bingham County as lead. EICITF is made up of different law enforcement agencies from 16 different counties, including city, county and state agencies. ""It's made up of those entities and they're investigators and they're trained. In fact, we have training scheduled for this, coming up on January 16th and 17th, a two-day training. They're training, specifically for handling investigations involving critical incidents,"" said Bannock County Sheriff Tony Manu, who is on the task force's board. The task force can be activated on any incident involving an officer. ""This is a group of investigators to do that non-biased I guess you can say someone not affiliated with the agency that's involved in that critical incident. So that's good. That's why it was made up,"" Sheriff Manu said. Manu says the task force could be called for a high-speed car chase that ends with a person dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound or help with man-power. ""Maybe shootings happened while the pursuit was on, you could have crime scenes miles long where you need people that have secure crime scenes along the way, where there is maybe, shell casings here or there's some evidence here, maybe bad guys threw some stuff out here. So really, until you get there and you find out little more about the incident, that's really how you try to formulate how big of a how big of a group of investigators you need. So it's quite the task,"" Sheriff Manu said. A major role of the task force is to provide an unbiased investigation into these incidents. The assigned investigators may have heard some minor details come over their dispatch channels, but they won't know the whole picture until the investigation is complete. ""You never knew any details until you started the investigation. There's a briefing before you start the investigation. The lead investigator makes assignments to who's going to do interviews, who's going to do the crime scene, who's going to collect evidence, and who's going to take photographs? I mean, it's a big production,"" Sheriff Manu shared. The task force is broken up into two separate regions North and South. Bingham County is the central hub for the region and this task force. ""If you're an agency that needs the critical incident task force, you contact them and dispatch. They send out an alert to all the agencies saying there was an incident that occurred at such and such and such agencies. Please report if you can respond. If you have investigators that are available, please respond to this location and your point of contact is so and so,"" Sheriff Manu said. The reason for the regional breakdown of the task force is to mitigate how many people show up all at once. ""Because if you send it out to all the counties, you get 100 investigators for one incident and you'll be sending people home. And we've got way too many. So we've learned that over the years that we've got it. We've got to separate this because we had people responding from Bear Lake all the way to Teton County when we already had enough investigators,"" Sheriff Manu said. Manu says once the investigation by the task force is complete, it will be sent to the county's prosecutor where the incident happened. For instance, with the case of December 4th's Officer Involved Shooting, the facts of the case will go to the Bonneville County Prosecutor. However, the case may not stay there. ""Then if he feels he needs an unbiased opinion, he can take that case and farm it out to another prosecutor. It's really up to that prosecutor in that venue,"" Sheriff Manu said. Manu clarified the task force isn't to help cops cover for each other but to provide a fact-based investigation. ""It's not a matter of taking sides. We do an actual fact-finding, just like you would any other criminal investigation, and you let the chips fall where they are,"" Sheriff Manu said. The Task force has been around for several years and has investigated several different incidents. ""The fortunate thing is we do have this training and the fortunate thing is we're getting pretty good at this,"" Manu said.

The shooting happened shortly after midnight, when officers with the Woodstock Police Department responded to a call for service near the 500 block of Georgia Loop in Woodstock, ALEA said. Upon arrival, police located Goodson, who garnered local and national recognition after being featured on the “S-Town” podcast, barricaded inside a residence, “and a standoff ensued,” the state agency said. ALABAMA WOMAN RECIEVES SENTENCE AFTER MURDERING MAN WITH BASEBALL BAT IN 2019 Law enforcement officers from various agencies were called for assistance.Â Goodson allegedly brandished a gun during the incident, and officers shot and killed him. Police have not released any other information about the deadly shootout. ALABAMA MAN ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF COLD CASE KILLING OF PARENTS IN TENNESSEE NEARLY 50 YEARS AGO Just before his death, Goodson apparently took to Facebook to share what was happening from his since-deleted account, according to local news. “Police bout to shoot me down in my own yard,” he wrote, as WIAT and al.com first reported. Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital he knows “everyone wants answers and details” regarding Goodson’s death. “Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community.Â That love extends far beyond due to the âS-Townâ podcast,” he said. “Please remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many.” ALABAMA MAN GETS LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR KILLING 5 FAMILY MEMBERS WHEN HE WAS 14 “S-Town” documents life â and scandalous rumors â in Woodstcok from the perspective of a man named John B. McLemore, who reached out to journalist Brian Reed via email in 2012 using a nickname with an expletiveÂ for his town, which he loves and hates at the same time. McLemore, a clock repairman, asked Reed, who was based in New York, to investigate a murder in the small Alabama town, and Reed took him up on the request after about a year of email correspondence.Â McLemore died by suicide in 2015 while the show was still in production. The podcast aired in 2017. Goodson was McLemore’s friend and employee and referred to McLemore as a father figure. “If (Goodson) has his shirt on, you know he must be going to court. At least that’s what his mom will tell me one day,” Reed says in the first episode of “S-Town.” “Today, apparently, he’s not on the docket because he’s standing here, shirtless, tattooed, with an anatomical heart on his chest that says âmisery loves company.â” BABY IN ALABAMA MAULED TO DEATH BY FAMILY’S PET âWOLF-HYBRIDâ Reed added that Goodson was telling stories about “run-ins with the cops” during their first meeting. In 2017, Goodson was arrested for allegedly taking things from McLemore’s property after his death. Goodson said he was getting items that belonged to him at McLemore’s home, a detail that is mentioned in the podcast. “S-Town,” which comes from “Serial” Productions and “This American Life,” won the Peabody Award in 2017. Goodson told The Associated Press in a 2017 interview his fame from the podcast had not helped him in life.Â “Itâs a sad story, especially if youâre part of it,” Goodson said. An investigation into the shootout is ongoing, ALEA said. Authorities will submit findings to the Bibb County District Attorney’s Office once the investigation is complete. The Associated Press contributed to this report."

According to the Attorney General’s Office, one man sustained fatal injuries. His identity is not being released at this time. Manchester Police Officers responded to Elizabeth Avenue after a 911 call was received around 8:28 p.m. After officers found the man, two officers fired their weapons around 9:10 p.m. which fatally wounded him. A firearm was recovered near the man, officials said. A 2019 law requires the Attorney General’s Office to conduct investigations of a person’s death that occurs during an encounter with a law enforcement officer acting in the officer’s official capacity or while the decedent is in custody. It requires that all such investigations be presented to a grand jury to determine if the evidence supports the return of an indictment against the officer or officers involved. The investigation is ongoing and no further information is being released at this time. Jersey Shore Online went to the scene on the morning of December 6 and found a KIA Optima with major damage. The homeowner, who wished to remain anonymous, said they heard the suspect’s vehicle slam into the car and speed off while the police were in pursuit."

The Lord is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youth grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.” (Isa. 40:28-30) ""Oh, how this hits home. Several of us follow the Bible app’s scripture of the day. In our naivety, it can seem so surreal at how perfectly the scripture fits our lives. However, it doesn’t take long for us to realize God’s living Word does just that every day, it fits our lives perfectly and meets us where we are. Yesterday was no different. The scripture yesterday was Isaiah 40:31, “but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.” We are living, breathing examples of this. There is no other explanation. There is no way we could have made it through the last 19 days on our own under our own strength. We have grown tired and weary. We have stumbled. Yet, God has faithfully been with us every step of the way hearing our prayers, giving us strength, and renewing our spirits. ""The past couple of weeks have felt more like months as we have held our breaths hoping for the best but also bracing for the worst. It feels like Lucas has really turned a corner and we are ecstatic to report he is waking up! ""On Saturday evening, Sherry, his mother, called from the hospital to report that after the nurse suctioned Lucas’s trach she asked him if it felt better and he gently nodded his head up and down! She then asked him to squeeze her hands which he did with BOTH hands! He had not followed commands since 11/21 and this was the first time he had responded to a question. We cried more happy tears than you can imagine and celebrated this huge milestone in his recovery. ""On Sunday, he continued to follow commands and was tracking with his eye. We are still praying that his vision will be unaffected though the doctors have told us to expect some effect due to the nature of his injury. ""And as if all of this wasn’t enough, on Monday, Haley was showing him pictures of Eli and she asked him if he wanted to see more and he gave a thumbs up! Praise be to God! ""We are beyond grateful for these victories of which all glory belongs to our Heavenly Father, the Great Physician! We praise God for all He has done and continues to do. We are excited for the future. ""We are especially grateful for Lucas’s coworkers and the medical teams that have provided lifesaving efforts to him from the very beginning. They are truly our heroes. We do not have words to describe our gratitude. Though it will never feel like enough, thank you from the bottoms of our hearts. ""Please don’t stop praying! Your prayers are an integral piece of this work God is doing. Will you please continue to boldly pray for Lucas? Please pray that he continues to wake up and recover; that he is able to see without issue out of his left eye; and that he will be transferred to a rehabilitation center soon so that he can begin his rehabilitation journey. We continue to be grateful for you as well. Thank you for walking alongside us through all the ups and downs."" A fund has been set up to help the Watts family. To contribute, click here.

Police named the suspect Thursday morning as 36-year-old Ryan A. Hunt, saying he is in custody on the felony warrant for which he had been sought. No officers were hurt in the incident. “The investigation into Wednesdayâs events is ongoing; additional charges are expected,” police said Thursday. Anchorage Police Chief Michael Kerle said at a news conference Wednesday evening that police were informed at about 1:30 p.m. that Hunt was staying at the Hilton Garden Inn. Officers responded to the inn off Tudor Road just east of C Street and set up a perimeter around it, also taking position in the hallway outside Huntâs second-floor room. A police negotiator called Hunt, but he disconnected the call and opened the roomâs front door, Kerle said. â(Hunt) entered the threshold of the room with an object in his hand in what appeared to be a shooting stance,â Kerle said. âOne of the officers that were in the hallway fired his weapon at least one time.â At that point, Kerle said, Hunt retreated into the room and jumped through a window but was detained outside. Medics took him to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries to his upper body, police said. Kerle said it wasnât initially clear whether Hunt was struck by the officerâs gunfire, sustained injuries from the jump or both. Police also found a woman in the room with facial injuries, which she told officers the suspect had caused, police said. None of the officers at the scene were wearing body cameras, Kerle said. About 58 officers â roughly a quarter of the departmentâs patrol force â have been equipped with them since their rollout began last month, Kerle said. Police spokeswoman Renee Oistad declined to answer further questions about the incident Thursday morning, citing the ongoing investigation. The incident is under investigation by police as an officer-involved shooting, with the officer who fired on four days of administrative leave before being publicly identified. The state Office of Special Prosecutions will examine the incident, before officers with the departmentâs Internal Affairs Unit conduct a review."

And it’s the second shooting in recent memory that occurred on the UNLV campus, although there have been several shootings along the edge of campus since 2020 — including the shooting of Metro police officer Truong Thai, who was shot near the 800 block of East Flamingo Road, near University Center Drive. A list of recent shootings in the UNLV area: - May 5, 2020: 19-year-old Trayvone Dixon was shot and killed in a drug transaction near Maryland Parkway and Tropicana Avenue. - Jan. 22, 2022: A shooting at The Degree Housing Complex, located on Cottage Grove Avenue along the edge of campus near Maryland Parkway and Flamingo Road, involved two people who were not UNLV students. - Oct. 13, 2022: Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer Truong Thai was shot and killed and a civilian was also hit in an exchange of gunfire with Tyson Hampton, who is scheduled to go to trial on Feb. 5, 2023.

Viv and I swapped days for Slog this week, which obviously we shouldn't have done because we've caused a day of darkness and a flood watch. The National Weather Service says rainfall of between two to eight inches caused a bunch of muddy conditions, already causing some small landslides in Seattle and raising the Snolqualmie River in some parts of King County. If you're driving and you see a flooded road, TURN AROUND! ""Most flood deaths occur in vehicles,"" according to the weather service. Also, today is not a good day to walk along river banks.Â The Big Dark is in full force today.â Seattle Weather Blog (@KSeattleWeather) December 5, 2023 TimeÂ crowns Taylor Swift person of the year: I mean, yes. A massive stadium tour that grossed more than a billion dollars, a blockbuster movie about that stadium tour, and multiple album drops in the last two years. As Time says, ""If youâre skeptical, consider it: How many conversations did you have about Taylor Swift this year?"" She dominated the culture, and truly lived up to her Jesus year of 33 years old. Boeing weapons killed at least 19 children in Gaza, according to an Amnesty International report mentioned by the Washington Post. Israel used the US-made munitions in airstrikes that killed a total of 43 civilians in Gaza, including 19 children, 14 women, and 10 men, according to the report. The Amnesty International Secretary General called for the US and other governments to stop sending weapons to Israel. Meanwhile, the US State Department complained about Israel not letting enough aid into Gaza. The Seattle IT Department trolled me: Yesterday, I wrote about a major proposed expansion of the Seattle Police Department's vehicle surveillanceÂ and told people they could still submit comment on the proposal. Then, I found out the public comment form had crashed. The IT Department got it back up and working, but it was down for at least three hours. Still no word on if the department plans to extend the comment period, which ends Friday. Honestly peak Seattle is the form for public comment breaking on the IT department's websiteâ Ashley Nerbovig (@AshleyNerbovig) December 6, 2023 What's this about surveillance? Seattle cops want to install Automated License Plate Reader technology in all 300 of its patrol cars, resulting in a massive amount of data collection including where cars were spotted and when. SPD stores that data for 90 days, and not only do cops have access to that data, but anyone can request the database of license plate photos and numbers along with the time, date, and location of when SPD took the photo. A lot of cities purge this data quickly if the plate doesn't match a ""hot list."" SPD gave no real explanation for why it couldn't purge the data sooner, beyond just promises it could help them solve more crime. Studies show just .2%-1% of license plates captured by this technology are associated with a crime. Renton City Council rejects minimum wage increase: As Hannah covered yesterday, the Renton City Council voted down a proposal to raise the city's minimum wage to $19 per hour, instead putting the question to voters in an upcoming February special election. Renton only requires businesses to pay $15.74, a far cry from neighboring cities. Read Hannah's story, one City Council member talks some shit on workers. Bellevue police officers shot and killed a man: Witnesses said the man came into an LA Fitness with a knife, and the gym manager called police, according to KING 5. No injuries reported to officers or bystanders. King County approves modest budget reduction, but deeper cuts could come next year without help from the state, according to the Seattle Times. General fund cuts could exceed $30 million, resulting in the shutdown of most of its 10 public health clinics. The County cut $13 million from the general fund this year.Â Abortions rose by 23% in Washington in 2022: While abortions among residents increased, the number of people from outside Washington increased by 46%, according to the Seattle Times. Glad to be of service. Multiple dead in Texas shootings: Police arrested a 34-year-old Texas man for allegedly killing at least six people, and injuring three, according to the Austin American-Statesman. Police found two bodies at the man's home, and they're investigating how those two bodies might be connected to the Austin high school, where the shooting started. YOU!

Family members of driver Frank Ordonez complained on Tuesday, the fourth anniversary of the shooting, that no one had been held accountable for the barrage of gunfire that ended the standoff. Grand jury proceedings are normally secret, but a television news station disclosed Tuesday night that the Broward grand jury will be looking at the case. “We can confirm that prosecutors plan to present the investigation to the grand jury, possibly over several weeks or months,” said Broward State Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Paula McMahon. The presentation will start early next year, she said. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement turned its findings over to the Broward State Attorney’s Office last year. Official reports show as many as 20 law enforcement officers from six South Florida agencies were involved in the standoff at the intersection of Miramar Parkway and Flamingo Road on Dec. 5, 2019. The drama began earlier in Coral Cables, where ex-convicts Lamar Alexander and Jerome Hill hijacked Ordonez’s UPS truck after trying to rob a jewelry store on Miracle Mile, according to police accounts. With Ordonez as a hostage, the men made their way to Miramar, where a shootout with police ensued. Ordonez, Alexander and Hill died, as well as bystander Richard Cutshaw. But questions remain about whether the police shooting was necessary, whether the robbers fired first, and whether adequate safety measures were taken before lethal force was employed. Former Hollywood police union chief Jeff Marano said Wednesday he is confident the police use of force will be shown to be justified. “They’re going to bring in use-of-force experts who are going to show what was going through these officers’ minds when they took action,” Marano said. “We’re going to see that this was not a criminal act.” Grand jurors will have the option of charging officers with reckless endangerment, manslaughter or misdemeanor offenses, or declaring that the police response was justified or, at the least, not criminal.

(WTVD) -- ABC11 is learning new details about the investigation into the Aug. 28 shooting at UNC-Chapel Hill that left a professor dead in an academic building in the heart of campus. Orange County District Attorney Jeff Nieman, the top prosecutor in the case, confirmed on Wednesday that the gun used to kill UNC faculty member Zijie Yan has not been recovered. He said authorities continue to search for it, three months after the shooting, as part of their investigation. Nieman couldn't comment specifically about Tailei Qi, the graduate student charged with murder in Yan's death -- or on the case particulars -- but said he's generally concerned about access to firearms for people with mental health issues. ""I'm very concerned about people, the ease of access to acquiring firearms for people with mental defects, with mental health concerns,"" Nieman said. Last week, an Orange County Judge ruled that Qi was unfit to stand trial, meaning he would be transferred to a facility for treatment and rehabilitation with the hopes he could stand trial at a later date. In ABC11's sit down, Nieman drew a distinction between that ruling -- which is an indicator of Qi's current mental state -- and the question of Qi's mental state at the time the crime was committed. ALSO SEE: 3 dead, gunman killed by officers after opening fire at UNLV campus ""Someone could be mentally capable of committing the crime, have the requisite mental intent to commit the crime, but then at a later time when they come to court, not be mentally fit for trial,"" Nieman said. ""And the reverse could be true."" Nieman said the issue of Qi's competence during the crime has not yet been decided and could go either way. If he's able to be rehabilitated at the current facility and stand trial, that issue could be taken up. In the wake of last week's ruling, ABC11 reached out to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to learn more about the laws surrounding mental health, and how that factors in when purchasing a gun. The agency said mental health concerns and mental illness, in general, wouldn't stop gun buyers from completing a purchase, provided they were never ruled mentally unfit to have a gun by a judge in court. In fact, they sent the only form gun buyers are required to fill out when purchasing, which includes just one, yes-or-no question about mental health: ""Have you ever been adjudicated as a mental defective OR have you ever been committed to a mental institution?"" If the answer to that is no, the ATF said mental health concerns can't stop the purchase on their own. Nieman says a lack of universal background checks makes the issue even trickier. ""It's not uncommon for people who are not legally able to get a gun -- they can get it because they don't have to pass a background check first,"" he said."

One additional gunshot victim was initially listed in critical condition at a local hospital and later upgraded to stable, police said. Authorities said there is ""no further threat"" to the university, which has been closed for the rest of the day. Authorities did not publicly release the name of the shooter. But multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News the deceased suspect is Anthony Polito, 67. Polito had applied for a professor position at UNLV but was not hired, those sources told ABC. He had previously worked as a professor in North Carolina and Georgia. Investigators were searching an apartment in Henderson, Nev. that was believed to be the shooter's home. Detectives have also obtained his phone and are searching for clues as to a motive for the attack. Sources indicate the victims who were killed were faculty or staff members. It's still not clear if they were intentionally targeted but the fact that the victims were not students suggests to detectives it may not have been entirely random. Police briefing on UNLV shooting ""Our hearts go out to the entire UNLV community,"" said Sheriff Kevin McMahill with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. ""No student should have to fear pursuing their dreams on a college campus. What happened today is a heinous, unforgivable crime."" In addition to those struck by gunfire, the sheriff said four others were transported to local hospitals after suffering panic attacks and two officers incurred minor injuries during the search of campus. McMahill declined to release the name of the suspect at a 5 p.m. briefing. The motive remains under investigation. UNLV President Keith E. Whitfield wrote in a message to the campus community: ""Today is a tragic day for UNLV. It is with the utmost sadness and grief that I am writing to you about a shooting that took place late this morning on our campus - our home. We're all still in shock as we process the unfathomable event. Members of our community lost their lives and others were injured. My heart aches for our UNLV family. I know all of us are sending our love and support to the victims, their families, and friends during this difficult time."" The shooting was first reported on campus at 11:45 a.m. Shots were reported in the area of Beam Hall, home of UNLV's Lee Business School, as well as the school's student union, which is next door. Both campus police and Las Vegas metro officers responded to the scene. Two detectives with the campus force ultimately were the first to locate and engage the suspect, according to campus police Chief Adam Garcia. ""Two of our detectives responded to the scene,"" Garcia said at a 5 p.m. briefing. ""They immediately engaged the suspect in a shootout. The suspect was struck and is deceased at this time."" McMahill said the quick response likely prevented further deaths. A large group of students were gathered in the area for a campus event, where students were playing games, eating food and building Legos. ""If it hadn't been for the heroic actions of one of those police officers who responded, there could have been countless additional lives taken,"" the sheriff said at the 5 p.m. briefing. ""Armed confrontation of the suspect by law enforcement stopped the suspect's further actions."" Shortly after the shots rang out, students were urged to hide or evacuate when possible. ""This is not a test,"" the university wrote in a post on X. ""RUN-HIDE-FIGHT."" ""Students hunkered down, they're afraid, they're scared,"" said Sheriff McMahill. ""Our officers are going unit by unit, building by building."" Officers later escorted students off campus. ""Lots of cops on campus,"" one student said. ""They had guns. We all walked out of the building with our hands up."" She said as she and her friends walked past the student union building, they could see a window shattered and pieces of glass scattered around. Within about 40 minutes of the initial alert, Las Vegas police posted on X that a suspect ""has been located and is deceased."" A ground stop was initiated at Las Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport on Wednesday due to the close proximity of the airport runways to the shooting site, and because of the police response to the shooting, which included helicopters, according to an official briefed on the incident. Classes and other activities were canceled, including a UNLV basketball game at the University of Dayton, Ohio. The campus is expected to remain closed Thursday and Friday. Officials will determine if additional closures should extend into next week, when final exams for the semester are supposed to begin. The shooting occurred in a city still scarred by one of the worst mass killings in U.S. history, the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting at the Mandalay Bay casino in Las Vegas, in which 60 were killed and hundreds more wounded. The UNLV campus is just over three miles from that location. UNLV has more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students at its 332-acre campus is less than 2 miles east of the Las Vegas Strip, the area's bustling tourist hub, and just across from Harry Reid International Airport. The Associated Press and ABC News contributed to this report."

The police oversight commission held their session on Thursday, Nov. 30 and City Council held its interviews the following morning. The candidates, Andre Anderson, Eric Hawkins, Carmelin Rivera and Kyra Joy Hope, were each interviewed separately covering topics like mental health, transparency, accountability, implicit bias, alternative responses and artificial intelligence in law enforcement technology. Former Ann Arbor police Chief Michael Cox stepped down from the position in July 2022, with Interim Chief Aimee Metzer temporarily taking on the role. The search for a new chief is led by Baker Tilly, an executive search firm. City Administrator Milton Dohoney Jr., who nominates candidates for the police chief position, said in a statement that he remains committed to having a permanent police chief by the end of the year. Candidates voiced support for transparency, developing unarmed crisis responses, community policing and officer wellness. The interviews are presented here in the same order the candidates appeared before Council and the commission. Andre Anderson Anderson is a veteran and most recently served as assistant police chief of Tempe, Arizona, from 2021 to this year. Anderson is also the former interim police chief of the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri. He stepped in after a white officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed Black 18-year-old, in 2014 and a federal investigation concluded that Ferguson’s police department was frequently violating the constitutional rights of Black residents. Anderson was appointed interim chief in July 2015. He was recruited from Glendale, a suburb of Phoenix, and took unpaid leave from his position as commander until a permanent chief could be hired in Ferguson. He intended to stay for six months but resigned a month early in December 2015. Ferguson’s mayor praised Anderson for his “exceptional and innovative” work as interim chief. Anderson was also executive deputy chief in Rochester, New York, from 2020-21. He has a bachelor’s degree in public safety administration and a master’s degree in education leadership. Anderson emphasized the importance of accountability in law enforcement, saying it has a “great impact” on the branding and messaging of a police department. He said that also impacts recruiting. “Grace is important with accountability, primarily because when the employees understand that you have grace, then they can also extend grace to the people they come into contact with,” Anderson told Council. “And it doesn’t mean that we’re going to allow people to do anything they want… Accountability also requires that we follow the rules in place, that we work with the commission of oversight, that we work with our police department and our unions, to make sure that we’re all in the court with accountability.” Anderson also told the oversight commission that he will not “incorporate any AI that has a detrimental impact on people.” “I’m not a big proponent of [AI] as with respect to how it develops probable cause for an arrest,” he later told Council. “But it can be used for safety measures to determine if a person is coming inside of a building with a gun. That also can be used for body-worn camera information where there are programs that can capture conversations, comments and things that lead up to use of force.” The oversight commission also asked Anderson his feelings on the public release of completed police complaint investigations. He said it could be a challenge, but the reality is that the department would have to accept a mandate like that. “My feeling is we have to manage it,” he said. “But... we have a lot of control over the police department. Don’t get in trouble... We’re gonna make mistakes but if you don’t do something so egregious that it causes problems then you don’t have anything to worry about.” Eric Hawkins Although Eric Hawkins has served as the chief of police in Albany, New York, since 2018, he began his career in law enforcement in 1991 in Southfield, and served as its chief of police from 2012-18. He has a bachelor’s degree in public administration, a master’s degree in public administration and a juris doctor degree. Hawkins emphasized the importance of transparency during the interviews. He said he supports the public release of completed police complaint investigations, keeping in mind police union and other regulations around information that can be released. Hawkins told the commission that he has dealt with a number of “high profile incidents” where he released body camera footage within a couple days. “If it is something that people have some issues with, get correct information out there, even if it’s unfavorable,” Hawkins said to the commission. Hawkins also discussed his experience in implementing community programs at his department in Albany, New York in response to a “great deal of tension” in the city after the murder of George Floyd. Under his leadership, he said, the department created a “Community Liaison Program” where community members can get involved with the training of officers while they are in the academy. Hawkins also said that mental health is among the most important training for police right now, saying that he also has partnered with his county health department in his current department to develop responses to mental health crises. “We needed to have a response to these sorts of acts where the police officers and uniformed police officers with guns were not the primary point of contact,” he said. Carmelin Rivera Carmelin Rivera currently serves as a lieutenant of internal affairs with the San Diego Police Department. He has worked in various positions in the department since 2018, including acting captain/lieutenant of investigations for sex crimes/child abuse, lieutenant for domestic violence/family just center and acting captain/lieutenant for the neighborhood policing division. Rivera said that police need to be transparent despite the “veil” traditionally set up to protect themselves. He gave the Council one example from his current job at the San Diego Police Department, noting the department has over 70 surveillance programs. “Transparency means I can go to the community and say, ‘I need these programs because it’s going to help fight crime.’ I think everyone will agree to that. The next question that’s going to come is: how do we know how those are going to be managed? How do we know that they’re not going to be abused? That’s where transparency comes in.” Rivera also offered ideas for recruitment and retention of officers, such as a housing stipend and working with labor and community outreach groups. “We have to think about how we often closed doors on certain candidates,” he said. “Because we have, oftentimes, archaic systems of vetting people.” Rivera has a bachelor’s degree in general studies from the University of Michigan, a master’s degree in executive leadership and is currently enrolled in a Leadership Studies doctoral program with specialization in organizational leadership at the University of San Diego. Kyra Joy Hope Hope has served as the second deputy chief of office and field support with the Detroit Police Department since 2022. She began with the department in 1987. Hope told Council that in order to create a culture of accountability, she would use performance indicators within the department. “We have to have measurables inside the organization with defined expectations that this is the policy and procedures that we’re going to follow,” she said. “And if they’re violated, they’re going to be documented and there will be discipline.” Hope also told the commission she would not tolerate officers not following body camera policy, such as recording during any interaction with a community member. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the Detroit Police Department for wrongfully arresting Porcha Woodruff and Robert Williams after police used facial recognition technology in their investigation. Hope said that under her watch, artificial intelligence -- like facial recognition technology and license plate readers -- would not be used to “violate someone’s civil rights.” “Even though [the Detroit Police department is] a large agency, and we’re utilizing that technology… it’s not good for everyone,” Hope told Council. “And everyone needs to understand what the pros and the cons are. And the community as well as all partners at the table need to be able to assist and assess exactly what it is that they need.” Hope has a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s degree in business technology and management.

Moran,N,"Our communities are shaken by the death of Cortez Police Sgt. Michael Moran on Nov. 29, after being shot during a traffic stop on South Broadway across from Handy Mart in southwest Cortez. Moran isn’t from Cortez but he adopted the Southwest as his home, showing his love for it and its communities in how he did his job, how he was with people. Moran left behind two daughters, many friends and family members. A lot of memories have been shared in recent days of his dedication, passion for what he believed in and his sense of humor, especially in unexpected moments. Known for being calm in tense situations that could quickly accelerate, Moran would sometimes give fellow police officers a goofy grin during serious moments. A light reminder that the officers could manage whatever was at hand. They could keep themselves – and everyone else – safe. As reported in The Journal and The Durango Herald, Moran, 46, served as a Marine for nine years, including two tours in Iraq, before joining the Cortez Police Department in 2012. He rose through the ranks to become a canine handler in 2016. Otto became Moran’s beloved companion, serving by his side until the dog retired in 2020. Otto has since died, but while on duty with Moran, the team grew a sizable fan base after visiting schools and giving presentations about how they worked together. Moran and Otto were always a hit. We have much reverence for this man who served his community and country in uniform. And we’re made aware, once again, how dangerous jobs in law enforcement are during routine traffic stops. Moran’s death is the first of a Cortez police officer in the line of duty since Dale Claxton, who was killed in 1998, when he stopped a stolen water truck. On Saturday, Cortez’s holiday Parade of Lights ended with a tribute to Moran, with messages on cars, trucks and police vehicles to “Rest in Peace.” The procession of nearly six blocks ended with Moran’s car, draped in a black shroud, a somber contrast to the Christmas festivities and merry-making. The police department then fell into line, followed by a Fallen Heroes trailer. If you happen to believe in an afterlife with loved ones waiting, we imagine Otto there, greeting Moran with much tail wagging. Private funeral services for Moran will be held today at the Cortez Recreation Center, which is closed all day. The city is asking the public to stay away from the area. For information about viewing the services remotely, visit Colorado Fallen Hero Foundation at https://tinyurl.com/5yw9rwc8. We can’t, though, end our condolences just yet. It’s heartbreaking to learn about – and have seen – a video shot from across the road, immediately after the traffic stop, with Moran down on the street, dying of his injuries. The suspect is seen either picking up a magazine or expended shells, running off, then driving away with Moran left behind. Many in Cortez’s community have seen this video on social media. More shared it widely. What’s the value in this? None. If you have the video, please, delete it. If you see the video, insist it be taken down. It feels terribly disrespectful and it’s too painful for loved ones. If the video were sent directly to law enforcement to help track down the suspect, who died minutes later in a shootout with police, that’s one thing. A reason to film. But it remained online after the shooter was killed by police. This is what is most difficult and hurtful for loved ones of Moran. The video brings back sad memories for those close to Claxton, too. It’s intolerable, especially knowing that video made the rounds. An awful response after this tragedy. We in the Southwest share minimal degrees of separations among each other. Our communities are fairly small. Posting and sharing that video has unintended consequences. It’s also a sign of the times. Social media has desensitized us, taking away some social graces, some foresight into how it might feel for a family member to view that. If you have the video, stop and think what’s befitting to honor a slain police officer. Sharing that video is definitely not it."

University police responded to reports of shots fired around 11:45 a.m. local time on the fourth floor of Beam Hall near the student union building, with campus alerting students to âRUN-HIDE-FIGHT.â âThis is not a test,â the emergency alert read. UNLV police and LVMPD officers responded to the scene, officials said. Two campus detectives “immediately engaged the suspect in a shootoutâ outside of the building, UNLV Police Chief Adam Garcia told reporters at a press conference Wednesday night. “The suspect was struck and is deceased at this time,â Garcia said. The suspected shooter is a 67-year-old career college professor who previously taught at East Carolina University in North Carolina, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press, adding that they had unsuccessfully sought a job at UNLV. The alleged gunman is 67 and also had connections to universities in Georgia, law enforcement sources told CN LVMPD Sheriff Kevin McMahill said that police have confirmed the identity of the suspect, but are not releasing their name at this time. He also declined to reveal the suspectâs affiliation with the UNLV or what they were doing on campus. Three victims were found dead and a fourth was taken to an area hospital with gunshot wounds where they are recovering in stable condition, McMahill said. Four others were hospitalized after suffering panic attacks and two officers were treated for minor injuries suffered while clearing buildings, he said. The shooterâs motive remains under investigation. The UNLV campus is about two miles from the Las Vegas Strip and across from Harry Reid International Airport. Roughly 30,000 students attend the school. The campus was placed on lockdown almost immediately after the shooting was reported. Police evacuated students and staff on campus âfloor by floor, room by room, building by building,â McMahill said. UNLV officials asked students to remain sheltered in place as the buildings were evacuated one at a time. One University of Nevada student told local outlet KVUU she hunkered down in the campusâ student union building after she learned about the active shooter alert. “We found out cops were on site and we just sheltered in place until we were evacuated. And it took us about 30 minutes to get us evacuated,” the student, Jessica, said. Another student described how about 200 students huddled together in the building as they heard gunshots ring out. “A lot of people were panicking,â the student, who did not wish to be named, told the outlet. She said armed officers evacuated them out of the building with their hands up. As they were escorted out of the student union, she said they âwalked past one of the windows, the window was shot out, glass everywhere.â A reunification center for those who had family members on campus has been established at the Las Vegas Convention Center, according to Clark County officials. Officials said that in addition to UNLV, all other Nevada System of Higher Education institutions in the southern part of the state were shut down for the remainder of the day. UNLV Police Chief Garcia said that the schoolâs campus would remain closed through Friday. The school could still be closed next week, when students are scheduled to take final exams, he said. UNLVâs scheduled menâs basketball game against the University of Dayton has been canceled, the Ohio collegeâs basketball program announced on social media. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman offered her âcondolences on behalf of the entire city and the community,â at Wednesday nightâs press conference. “What a tragic time for us but it’s time to be positive and do something,â she added. Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, the former Clarkâs County Sheriff, praised law enforcement for their quick response. The UNLV shooting and Tuesday’s two deadly shootings in Texas prompted President Biden to call on congressional Republicans to ban assault weapons. “Jill and I join citizens across our nation in praying for the families of our fallen, and for those who were injured during these latest acts of senseless violence,” the president said. “For all the action we have taken since Iâve been president, the epidemic of gun violence we face demands that we do even more. But we cannot do more without Congress,” Biden said. There have been 80 school shootings so far this year, according to CNN, breaking last year’s record of 79 over the same period. Of this year’s school shootings, 51 occurred on K-12 campuses while the other 29 were at colleges or universities."

Wesley Allen, 42, said he is homeless and has been living in the area for about three weeks. He heard an argument this afternoon between a group of people who had just moved into the area — three men and a woman — and his friend, whom he identified as “Nomad.” Allen said Nomad objected to the other people’s drug use and had confronted them about it. Allen said he was inside his tent when he heard two gunshots, then saw the group of four running north away from Nomad, who was face down on the ground, shaking. Two fellow campers ran over to Nomad, whom Allen said was in his 50s, and started performing CPR. Within about 10 minutes, a police officer arrived and cut open the man’s shirt to reveal two bullet holes, Allen said. “He got into an argument and that was it,” Allen said. “Shot over words.” As many as 18 Portland police units responded to Southeast Main Street and Water Avenue and put up yellow crime scene tape around 1:45 p.m. Police said at 4:45 p.m. that the suspect or suspects fled the scene before officers arrived, and they had made no arrests. Earlier in the day, a Portland police officer shot and killed a man near an RV in an industrial area of Northeast Portland after what police described as a report of theft. The deaths mark the 69th and 70th homicides in Portland so far this year. — Catalina Gaitán, cgaitan@oregonian.com, @catalinagaitan_ Our journalism needs your support.

Details are sparse, but a Portland Police bureau (PPB) spokesperson confirmed at the scene that an officer opened fire on an adult man while responding to a call about someone stealing electricity from a nearby business just after 10 a.m. at NE 92nd and Marx.Â According to police, two officers from PPBâs North Precinct responded to an RV parked along the street, when they encountered a man and fired. The man died at the scene. Police later reported that a handgun was found near the victim.Â The shooting happened outside the Ventura Foods warehouse, where several people live in RVs camped out across the street. At the scene Wednesday afternoon, police blocked off the street, restricting access in and out of businesses nearby.Â Itâs unclear whether police were searching for a suspect when the shooting occurred. A spokesman at the scene indicated one officer opened fire, but that information has yet to be confirmed.Â Two officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave, in accordance with bureau policy.Â âWe are in the very early stages of this investigation and we intend to release more information as soon as possible,â Mike Benner, a public information officer with PPB, told media. Information will likely be limited Police initially declined to say what type of theft they were responding to, or whether the emergency call came from a nearby business, or an individual, citing the need to ""protect the integrity of their investigation."" The police bureau has taken heat in recent months for purposely delaying the release of informationâspecifically, names of officers involvedâafter police shootings.Â Police cited a policy that was unilaterally put in place late last year by former Police Chief Chuck Lovell, to no longer release names within 24 hours, instead waiting weeks. The former chief cited concerns for officer privacy, safety, and âdoxxingâ of officers during active investigations. Lovell said the policy, which was criticized by police watchdog groups, âstrikes the right balance between transparency and the security concerns of our PPB members.â Police now say itâs their practice to wait 15 days, if not longer, before releasing names of officers involved in deadly force. Â While itâs become common practice for police to limit the amount of information about shootings involving officers, that typically isnât the case with investigations involving civilians.Â For example, just one day prior to the shooting, police released information about a deadly mauling of a 6-year-old boy by two dogs, which included information about the age of the boy, the relationship of the boy to the owner of the dogs, the type of dogs involved, as well as the extent of injuries to the owner of the dog, and which outside agencies were investigating.Â The week prior, police released a lengthy summary of an officer who stopped a robbery in progress, including a full summary of events and the name and physical description of the suspect in custody, in an attempt to locate additional robbery victims.Â Portland Police Chief Bob Day told media on scene Wednesday afternoon that the bureau will prioritize speedy, transparent communication about the case. He said PPB is working to reduce deadly shootings by its officers, saying the bureau is ""doing everything in our power and our ability to try to minimize these tragedies as they occur.â âWith that said, Iâm 100 percent committed to the process that we have in place,"" Day said. ""I know weâll work closely with our partners, the district attorneyâs office, other investigators, to be as accountable and transparent as possible.â Deadly shootings will soon get community oversight Wednesdayâs deadly shooting is the third officer-involved shooting by Portland police this year. The incident comes as the city is preparing to overhaul its police oversight system after voters in 2020 approved the creation of a new Community Board for Police Accountability (CBPA) to investigate misconduct complaints and use of force incidents involving police. While the community-led process wonât change criminal investigations into police shootings, the new civilian-led oversight board removes police from investigations into policy compliance and conduct of police. It will be the first oversight board in the city with the authority to impose discipline on officers. The new system is expected to be implemented sometime in 2025, pending approval by the US Department of Justice. Itâs unclear whether the new board will be subject to the same communication restrictions about its investigations that police currently observe."

Jail records show he was booked into the Travis County Jail around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday on capital murder charges as well as outstanding warrants. In a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar walked through more of the timeline. James was arrested in January 2022 for three misdemeanor assault charges. The victims were believed to be his parents and a sibling. ""The family said he doesn’t belong in jail; he has mental health issues,"" said Sheriff Salazar. According to Sheriff Salazar and Bexar County booking records, James was bonded out by the Texas Organizing Project on March 7, 2022. On March 8, 2022, he cut off his ankle monitor. The last altercation he had with law enforcement was in August 2023 when deputies received a call for a mental health episode at a home on Port Royal in San Antonio where it’s believed James lived with his parents. It's the same home where two people were found dead Tuesday night, ""tentatively identified"" as James’ parents, Phyllis James and Shane Matthew James, Sr. ""We know that there was a mental health history here,"" said Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales. ""But there was nothing to indicate that this individual was going to commit a murder, and certainly not one of this seriousness where you have multiple victims."" Prior to the recent charges, in 2017, James was arrested for a misdemeanor in Tarrant County. According to his LinkedIn profile, James served in the U.S. Army from 2013 to 2015. Sheriff Salazar said James left the military due to some kind of domestic violence incident during that time.

James also served as a shooting range safety officer at two ranges in the San Antonio area, according to his profile. The Travis County District Attorney’s Office released a statement saying in part: ""After he is magistrated, our office will formally receive the case and begin working on the prosecution in partnership with other prosecutors with jurisdiction. It is expected the defendant will remain in custody pending trial."" ""I don’t expect that he will be released to us…until they resolve their case,"" said Gonzales. ""But I will tell you that we are already taking steps to ensure this man doesn’t get out in the public."""

They believe the same suspect may have driven to Austin, where a school police officer was shot in the leg. Later, another couple was found killed inside their southside Austin home. A call for an active burglary brought an Austin police officer to another Austin home, where the officer was shot while engaged in a gunfight with the suspect.

Michael Owen not guilty of murder in the deadly shooting of a D.C. man in 2020. Owen was the first officer the county ever charged with murder in the line of duty, after he shot and killed 43-year-old William Green while the Southeast D.C. resident was handcuffed and sitting in the front seat of Owen’s police cruiser in January of 2020. It took the jury less than two hours of deliberations Wednesday to deliver the not guilty verdict, which came after hours of closing arguments earlier in the day. The trial began Nov. 28. While prosecutors argued the handcuffed Green did not pose a threat to the officer, attorneys for Owen argued throughout the trial that he acted in self-defense. On Monday, Owen took the stand in his own defense, saying that Green quickly became belligerent and combative after being arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of PCP and crashing into several vehicles in the Temple Hills area. Owen testified that during a struggle over his gun, the weapon went off. That’s when Owen fired six shots to “eliminate the threat,” he said. His testimony in court earlier this week marked the first time since the shooting Owen put his version of what happened on the record. Defense: Owen feared for his life During closing arguments Wednesday, defense attorney Thomas Mooney said law enforcement officials often have to make split-second decisions about use of force and that Owen acted in self-defense when he shot Green. Owen shot Green because the two were involved in a struggle over Owenâs gun, according to Mooney. Earlier in the trial, Mooney said multiple pieces of equipment inside the squad car, including Owenâs police radio, were damaged that night, which was indicative of a violent struggle in the vehicle. âNobody deserves to be shot and killed,â Mooney said, before adding the tragedy was the âproduct of the sequence of events that happened before Owen used his weapon.â Owen didnât shoot Green with the intent of killing him, Mooney argued, telling the jury that Owen thought he would die if he didnât shoot Green. Prosecution: ‘Green was not a threat’ During Wednesday’s closing arguments, Prince George’s County prosecutors argued Owen did not meet the standard for self-defense. Attorneys with Prince George’s County State’s Attorney argued Wednesday that Green was in handcuffs, was noncombative and was unarmed when he was shot six times, “blowing his heart out.” No other witnesses saw signs of a struggle leading up to the shooting, according to prosecutors, and an expert witness testified it would have been very difficult for Green to fight over Owen’s holstered weapon with his hands cuffed behind his back. According to lab DNA testing cited by the prosecution, Owen was the “majority contributor” to the DNA found on his gun and there were some “minority contributors,” but Green was not proved to be one of them. A medical witness for the prosecution testified Green had some scrapes on his legs and forehead, but that those injuries were more likely caused by the car crashes that happened before his arrest than a fight with Owen. Ultimately, prosecutors argued Green posed no imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to Owen, which is necessary to justify self-defense with deadly force. “Green was not a threat,” prosecutors said. What prosecutors said after the verdict Following Wednesday’s not guilty verdict, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy said she respects the jury’s decision, but was disappointed in the conclusion. “We believe that Cpl. Owen committed a crime that night, that he did, in fact, murder William Green,” she said. “However, the burden is on the state, and it’s a very high burden. There were only two people in the vehicle that night that could tell us what happened, and unfortunately one of them is no longer with us.” A historic settlement In September of 2020, Prince Georgeâs County officials announced a $20 million settlement with Green’s family. The settlement is among the largest in the U.S. involving someone killed by police, and came just months after the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, which sparked a nationwide push for police reform. âThere is no price that you can put on the life of a son, a father and uncle, a brother â there is no appropriate price tag to accompany a loss like that,â County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said during a news conference announcing the settlement. âBut we believe that the actions taken that night against Mr. Green and ultimately taken against his family warrant this settlement.â During the trial, Mooney, Owen’s defense attorney, said during the murder trial the narrative told by the county in the years since the shooting âis not true, not informed,â and is false. âThey never got it right,â said Mooney. âThey never got this right.â WTOP’s John Domen, Luke Lukert and Jack Moore contributed to this report."

First, an Austin ISD police officer was shot and injured at 10:43 a.m. at the Northeast Early College High School. Then, a man and woman were killed in south Austin just before noon in the 7300 block of Shadywood Drive. The third incident happened just before 5 p.m. when a male cyclist sustained non-life-threatening injuries after being shot at 5701 West Slaughter Lane. The fourth and final incident left two more people dead and another Austin police officer injured in Southwest Austin. Around 6:48 p.m., Austin 911 received a call about a burglary in the 5370 block of Austral Loop, near South Mopac and La Cross Avenue. Officers responded and found the suspect in the backyard. The man immediately shot at the officers. One of the officers was shot multiple times and returned fire. The suspect was not hit and fled from the scene in a vehicle. The officer was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Around 7:14 p.m., the suspect crashed after a brief pursuit with officers. He was taken into custody near the intersection of Southwest State Highway 45 and FM 1826. He remains in the Travis County Jail and is charged with Capital Murder, as well as an outstanding Assault with Injury Family Violence warrant. Further charges are pending. During the pursuit, officers entered the home on Austral Loop and found two people dead. Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said during a media briefing Tuesday night that the suspect arrested in Austin is related to a case where two people were found dead inside a home in San Antonio Tuesday morning before the AISD incident occurred. He says he believes the suspect arrested is in his 30s. ALSO| AISD officer shot in leg outside NE Austin high school The Austin police officer who discharged his firearm during the incident on Austral Loop has 12 years of service with the Austin Police Department. Per APD protocol, the officer will be placed on administrative duty. APD will conduct two concurrent investigations into the officer-involved shooting. The identity of the suspect was released later in the day. He was identified as 34-year-old Shane James. ""I'd like to express my deepest condolences to all the victims and their families who have been affected by the series of tragic events and horrific criminal acts,"" Austin Police Chief Robin Henderson said. The Travis County District Attorney's Office issued the following statement: Our hearts break for the shooting victims, injured officers, their families, and our communities impacted by yesterday’s senseless and tragic gun violence. We thank the Austin Police Department, Austin Independent School District Police, Texas Department of Public Safety, the US Marshalls, and the FBI for their quick work in apprehending this dangerous suspect. Our office is in communication with the Austin Police Department, other law enforcement partners, and federal prosecutors and prosecutors in Bexar County. The defendant has been charged in Travis County with multiple counts of Capital Murder. After he is magistrated, our office will formally receive the case and begin working on the prosecution in partnership with other prosecutors with jurisdiction. It is expected the defendant will remain in custody pending trial. Governor Abbott echoed the sentiment: Texans grieve for the loved ones of the six Texans who were murdered by a hardened criminal who must never see the light of day again. The murderer also shot two law enforcement officers in the line of duty. Texas is a law-and-order state, and violence will never be tolerated. We thank all state and local law enforcement and first responders who apprehended this criminal and protected their communities. The State of Texas will provide all resources necessary to impose the full weight of law on this criminal for his despicable crimes. Cecilia and I ask our fellow Texans to join us in lifting up in prayer the families and loved ones of those who were killed, as well as the Texans who are recovering from injuries, including an Austin Police Officer and an Austin Independent School District police officer.

Feysal Jama Ali, 18, of Minneapolis, entered the plea to the added charge Monday in Ramsey County District Court in connection with the killing of Elder, a 38-year-old father who was shot during a suspected marijuana robbery or attempted robbery on Jan. 10, 2022. He died a half-hour later at Regions Hospital of a gunshot wound to the back. In exchange for the plea, two counts of aiding and abetting second-degree murder will be dismissed at Ali’s sentencing, which is scheduled for March 27. Ali will be sentenced to a four-year prison term, with credit for time already served, the plea petition states. Locke’s cousin, Mekhi Camden Speed, then 17, shot Elder as he sat in his Chevrolet Tahoe in the 500 block of North Prior Avenue, between University Avenue and Interstate 94, according to the charges. In July, Speed was sentenced to 16 years and three months in prison after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder while committing an armed robbery. Speed said at his plea hearing that he went to the location to buy marijuana from Elder and that the plan changed to taking it. Speed lived in the apartment building in downtown Minneapolis where police served search warrants on Feb. 2, 2022. Locke, 22, was not named in the search warrants and was staying on a couch in Speed’s brother’s girlfriend’s apartment when police carried out a no-knock warrant and a Minneapolis officer shot him. Speed lived in a different unit with his mother, but had access to the other apartment, according to the criminal complaint. Minneapolis police requested a no-knock warrant to apprehend Speed for the officers’ safety and preservation of evidence. The request for the warrant demonstrated that Speed had a history of violence and that Elder was killed with a .223-caliber firearm, which could pierce body armor. Police body camera video showed that when police entered the apartment, announcing their presence, Locke, who was not a suspect, was stirred from a couch and emerged from under a blanket with a handgun that his family said he legally owned. Prosecutors did not charge the officer, saying body camera video showed Locke pointing a gun, but his family has said the footage suggests he was startled awake."

Mike Ernster of the St. Paul police is a nice guy who is often the bearer of bad news. But the St. Paul native, who grew up in Frogtown and graduated from Cretin High School, is exactly that. Whenever there's a homicide, an officer-involved shooting or a newsworthy crime in St. Paul, Ernster â the department's public information officer, commonly called the PIO â is usually the person appearing on camera and talking to reporters. Eye On St. Paul recently sat down with the affable Ernster, 54, to learn more about him and the demanding job of police spokesperson. This interview was edited for length. Q: Why law enforcement? A: I did have that light-bulb moment, sitting in my parents' basement, wondering what I wanted to do with my career. I was working at a credit union at the time. And I saw all these officers who were coming through the credit union. I liked them. And I started thinking maybe that's something for me. I went on some ride-alongs and one day, I just said, that's it. It took me 2 1â2 years to get hired. Back then there were 800 to 1,000 applicants for every opening. Q: What was it about those ride-alongs? A: The excitement of the job. I got a glimpse into what they do. And it really intrigued me, whether it was the calls we went on or the different people you deal with every day. Q: How long have you been a police officer? A: Twenty-nine years. Q: Tell me about the different jobs you've had as a police officer. A: I was a patrol officer. I worked afternoon to midnight shift for my first six years. Then I applied for the K9 unit. Q: How long were you with K9? A: Eleven years. I've been with two different dogs. My first dog was Bert; he ended up retiring because of a neck injury. I got a second dog. At the time, ""Toy Story"" was out, and my son liked Buzz Lightyear. So, my second dog was named Buzz. K9 was a great ice-breaker for speaking with people in our community. They come up and want to talk about the dog. But slowly, that talk would transition to what they were experiencing in their neighborhood. Q: Do you still have the dogs? A: No, they both passed away. After I went back to the street, I thought, ""What do I want to do with my career?"" I took the sergeant's exam, and I was promoted in 2013. Q: When did you start as a public information officer? A: 2015. I had expressed an interest in the role. Q: Why? A: I thought it would be interesting. It kind of went back to my K9 days. We did a show on Animal Planet called ""K9 Cops."" I had a camera crew with me while I interacted with this person who was involved in a shooting. I went to take him into custody and fell down and broke my arm. Through working with that show, I became somewhat comfortable with [talking to the public]. I thought it was important to show people what K9 handlers did. And I thought working as a PIO would be very similar. It was not. Q: How so? A: Think of an iceberg. What people see of a PIO is what they see poking above the surface. But there's a very large piece that's underneath the surface. That's the tougher part. There tends to be three big pieces of public information, any time we deal with a crisis: An officer-involved shooting or when an officer may be injured; daily incidents; and then we have things that are happening within the police department that are positive, that we want people to know about. Q: Is it hard being the bearer of bad news? A: Yes. That can be a weight of itself. But it's also very important in the sense that information still needs to come out. Lack of information will always lead to a void that's going to be filled by some narrative and we need to make sure as a police department that we're engaged in that conversation. Q: Do you like the job? A: I do. I like the busyness. The pace of it is very appealing. Can it be overwhelming? Yes. But on quieter days, I find myself [saying], ""Boy, I wish something would happen."" Q: Do you have kids? A: I do. A 23-year-old son and a 21-year-old daughter. Q: Are they in law enforcement? A: No. Q: Would you want them to be? A: I don't know. It is made for a certain personality. I worked for 19 years before I worked my first day shift. My wife and I were passing in the night for 19 years. Some people say that's why we're still married [laughs]. But it can be a grind and the shift work can be really hard. Q: You don't have 800 applicants for a job anymore. Why not? A: I think there are many reasons. From what we've seen in law enforcement in the past three years, I think the scrutiny on law enforcement is turning people [away]. Q: But you carry a gun. You have power. Shouldn't the scrutiny be high? A: One hundred percent. It's just thinned out the number of people who want to be involved in it. Q: How do you change that? A: You can try to break down what is policing. What do we do to try to educate people? I don't think there's anybody that's gotten to know us that's walked away from that encounter liking us less. I think there are a lot of misconceptions out there about what law enforcement is. And we need to bring people in and show them that what you might think happens does not. It's being transparent and being open. Q: Any regrets? A: No. Q: Have you made a difference? A: I would hope so. I've tried to treat people how I want to be treated. How I'd want my wife or my kids or my parents treated. I always tell officers, if you treat everyone like that, I don't think you'll ever have a problem."

Â Police said responding officers shot and killed Courtney Gordon, 38, after the suspect slashed both officers â one in the face, the other in the head â around 5 a.m. Sunday outside a home in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens. Both officers were treated for minor injuries and released from the hospital later Sunday. Authorities said three dead stabbing victims were discovered inside the house: a 12-year-old boy, a man in his 30s and a 44-year-old woman. An 11-year-old girl and a 61-year-old woman were also found in the home suffering from serious stab wounds, according to police. Both were taken to the hospital, where the preteen girl died and the woman was listed in critical condition. Authorities believe all the victims are related to Gordon. Police said the suspect set a couch ablaze inside the house before his fatal confrontation with officers in the driveway, briefly delaying a search of the home. “This scene was chaos â multiple victims, a house on fire and a madman on a rampage, on a mission,” Patrick Henry, president of the New York City Police Benevolent Association, said at a Sunday news conference. Gordon was previously arrested in the Bronx for strangling someone during a domestic incident, police said. • Matt Delaney can be reached at mdelaney@washingtontimes.com.

Feysal J. Ali, 18, of Minneapolis pleaded guilty Monday in Ramsey County District Court to being an accomplice after the fact to second-degree murder in connection with the death of Otis R. Elder, 38, on Jan. 10, 2022, as Elder sat in his vehicle. Sentencing for Ali is scheduled for March 27. He remains jailed in lieu of $1 million bail. Elder was shot in the back during a suspected drug transaction outside a music recording studio in the 500 block of N. Prior Avenue. He died about 30 minutes later at Regions Hospital. The shooter, Mekhi C. Speed, now 19, was sentenced in July 2022 to a term of more than 16 years after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. Speed is expected to serve roughly 10Â½ years in prison and the balance on supervised release. Speed was 17 when Elder was killed, and Ali was 16. Both were prosecuted in adult court. At the time of the shooting, Speed was living in a unit of the Bolero Flats Apartment Homes at 1117 S. Marquette Av. and also had access to a different unit where police barged in on Feb. 2, 2022, and shot the 22-year-old Locke, who was sleeping on the couch and emerged from under a blanket with a gun in his hand. Speed and Locke are cousins. Investigators alleged that Ali's cellphone was at the scene of Elder's shooting and near the apartment building where Locke was shot, according to the charges. The charges also said police found Ali's fingerprints on a stolen vehicle that he and Speed used to flee to downtown Minneapolis after the shooting. Also, his DNA was recovered from a jacket that investigators say was being worn by someone sitting next to Elder when he was shot, the charges added. The DNA matched a sample on file in a convicted offender database, the charges continued. According to Ramsey County prosecutors: On the night of Jan. 10, officers answered a 911 call and found Elder in the street wounded in the back. A person speaking with Elder on the phone just before he was shot told police that ""it sounded like Elder was conducting a drug transaction [and] the phone call then abruptly ended,"" according to the charges. As their investigation progressed, St. Paul police filed applications for search warrant affidavits for three Bolero Flats apartments. Locke, who was not a target of the investigation, was sleeping in the apartment of relatives when a Minneapolis police SWAT team burst in shortly before 7 a.m. on Feb. 2. Video from an officer's body camera showed police rushing inside and yelling ""Search warrant!"" as Locke lay under a blanket on the couch. An officer kicked the couch, Locke stirred, holding a firearm in his right hand. He was shot by officer Mark Hanneman, within seconds of police entering. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigated Locke's death. The county attorney at the time, Mike Freeman, and Attorney General Keith Ellison concluded there was not enough evidence to charge Hanneman or the officers involved with a crime stemming from Locke's death."

Joseph Tyler Goodson, 32, of Woodstock, barricaded himself inside of a house early Sunday, prompting a standoff with officers from the Woodstock Police Department, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) confirmed in a statement to The Hill. During the standoff, Goodson “brandished a gun” at officers before police shot him, the ALEA said. He was later pronounced dead. The ALEA said police were responding to a home in Woodstock for a call of service shortly after midnight when they “encountered” Goodson, who then barricaded himself in. The agency did not disclose what prompted the initial call to the house. “Police bout to shoot me down in my own yard,” Goodson posted in a message to his Facebook account early Sunday, according to reporting from WIAT and al.com. The ALEA will investigate the incident and share their findings with the Bibb County District Attorney’s Office. Goodson was a featured voice on the popular podcast “S-Town,” which covered the story of Goodson’s late friend, John B. McLemore, who “despised” the town of Woodstock and asked the podcast’s host, Brian Reed, to investigate a suspected unreported murder in Bibb County. The podcast’s focus then shifted to the life and later death of McLemore, a former restorer of antique clocks, who died by suicide before the show was released, The Associated Press reported. “Because you know, I ain’t ever had no daddy worth a damn. He’s just about the only daddy I’ve got,” Goodson said about McLemore in the the third episode of the podcast, per the AP. The podcast received a Peabody Award in 2017 and garnered 16 million views in the first week following its release. The Hill reached out those behind “S-Town” for comment. Goodson pleaded guilty to burglary and theft charges in 2017 related to taking items from McLemore’s property after his death, the AP reported. Goodson received a suspended sentenced and maintained the taken items belonged to him, according to the newswire. The rural town of Woodstock is located around 35 miles southwest of Birmingham. “I know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included,” Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement Monday, per the AP. “Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast.” “Please remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many,” the mayor continued. Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Harry Daniels told reporters Tuesday that the sum represents $1 million for every year Leonard Cure spent imprisoned in Florida on a wrongful conviction. He was killed just three years after Florida authorities set him free. âEverything was going right for Leonard, things were looking up, until he had this encounter with this sheriffâs deputy,â Crump said during a news conference with members of Cureâs family. Camden County Staff Sgt. Buck Aldridge killed 53-year-old Cure during a violent struggle on the shoulder of Interstate 95 after pulling him over for speeding and reckless driving. Dash and body camera video of the Oct. 16 shooting show Aldridge shocking Cure with a Taser after he refused to put his hands behind him to be cuffed. Cure fought back and had a hand at the deputyâs throat when Aldridge shot him point-blank. Relatives have said Cure likely resisted because of psychological trauma from his imprisonment in Florida for an armed robbery he didnât commit. Officials exonerated and freed him in 2020. The lawyers for Cureâs family say Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor should never have hired Aldridge, who was fired by the neighboring Kingsland Police Department in 2017 after being disciplined a third time for using excessive force. The sheriff hired him nine months later. And video from a June 2022 chase that ended in a crash shows Aldridge punching a driver who is on his back as the deputy pulls him from a wrecked car. Records show no disciplinary actions against the deputy. âWe donât believe he should have ever been a deputy at this point, when you look at the history of his violating the civil rights of citizens,â Crump said. Georgia requires lawyers to give formal notice to state or local government agencies before they can file civil lawsuits against them in state courts. The letter, which the Cure familyâs attorneys said they mailed Monday, gives Camden County 30 days to settle the case out of court. Cureâs mother, Mary Cure, said spending the holidays without her son has been painful and that coming into Georgia on the highway where he was shot had filled her with anxiety Tuesday. But she vowed to get justice for his death. âNo, the money doesnât mean a damned thing to me,â Mary Cure said. âI would rather have my child back.â Capt. Larry Bruce, a spokesman for the sheriff, said the department had not yet received the attorneysâ letter Tuesday. He declined further comment. An attorney for Aldridge, Adrienne Browning, declined to comment Tuesday. She has previously said heâs a âfine officerâ who shot Cure in self-defense. Aldridge is on administrative leave pending a decision by Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Keith Higgins on whether to seek criminal charges in Cureâs death. Three experts who reviewed video of the shooting told The Associated Press they believed it was legal, as Aldridge appeared to be in danger when he fired. But they also criticized how Aldridge began the encounter by shouting at Cure and said he made no effort to deescalate their confrontation.

Updated December 5, 2023 - 7:28 pm The man shot by Las Vegas police after allegedly stealing a tow truck and later barricading himself inside a home Wednesday night has been identified. Cristhyan Vizcarra, 39, underwent surgery at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center and remains there, Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Jamie Prosser said during a press conference Monday. Vizcarra is facing multiple charges, including two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of a stolen vehicle and one count of a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. Police responded to a call for service on Wednesday afternoon after Vizcarra allegedly pointed a gun at a tow truck driver who was trying to tow his vehicle because it was parked on private property, Prosser said. Vizcarra fled in his vehicle but later crashed near 3000 Ridge Lane, where, according to police, he then stole an unoccupied tow truck. Followed by a Metro helicopter, Vizcarra then drove the tow truck for approximately 20 minutes until he abandoned it near the 5700 block of Sand Trap Court and ran into a nearby house, where he barricaded himself. Vizcarra later left the garage on a motorcycle but was knocked off when SWAT fired several low-lethal rounds at him. He then ran, and officers pursued him on foot, police said. He was later shot after pointing a gun wrapped in a T-shirt at officers, Prosser said. Officer Coleman Oswald, 37, was later identified as the officer who shot Vizcarra. Oswald has been with the department since 2009 and is assigned to the Homeland Security and Special Operations Division. Oswald has been placed on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a review of the incident. Last week’s shooting is the eighth officer-involved shooting by Metro officers since the beginning of the year, and the fifth nonfatal shooting, police said Monday. Contact Taylor R.

Since mid-November, 54 officers have been trained and outfitted with cameras, Deputy Police Chief Sean Case said Tuesday. That’s about a quarter of all patrol officers. The department is able to install about four cameras a day on officers and their vehicles, Case said, so it’ll still take a while longer to get all 350 officers equipped. “It’s going to take some months to do,” Case said. In the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020 and amid protests and renewed calls for better police accountability, Anchorage voters in May 2021 approved a $1.6 million dollar tax levy to buy and equip city police officers with body cameras. The process was drawn out, with the police department and union taking months to agree on a set of policies and procedures around body-worn cameras, leading to frustration among Anchorage residents and a lawsuit from the Alaska Black Caucus. Under the approved policy, Anchorage officers are required to turn on their cameras any time they interact with the public. Members of the public can access the footage by filing a records request with the city, after police finish their initial investigations related to the footage. Case said there are some exceptions. “The prosecutor is going to have it, the defense attorneys are going to have it because it’s required that, you know, they have access to information,” he said. “Now, if you’re a victim of a crime, and your crime is being prosecuted, are you going to be able to get hands on a police report or a video prior to the resolution of the case? Yes.” Another exception is whenever there is a critical incident with officers, like a police shooting, high-profile hostage situation or mass casualty event. Last month, an officer fired at a suspect who police say pointed a pepper spray gun at the officer. Police say nobody was injured, and the officer who shot at the suspect was not yet equipped with a body-worn camera. In those cases, when officers fire their weapons, the body camera policy allows for the police chief to proactively release footage before investigations wrap up. Those decisions will involve balancing the interests of the public in getting information with the privacy of those involved, Case said “I will tell you that we’re taking it very seriously, proactively putting these videos out so that we can educate the public, we can give the public the information,” he said. “We’re also trying to determine how we can put that information out so that we also protect those victims.” The department will also continue to monitor how their internal systems can handle the cataloging of body camera footage, as officers continue to be trained and equipped with the cameras, Case said."

Officers with the Woodstock Police Department were dispatched to a call for service at a home just after midnight, according to the statement from authorities. It is unclear why police were called to the home in the small town that sits about halfway between Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. Once on scene, officers encountered Goodson, who barricaded himself in the residence and a stand-off ensued, the statement said. Authorities said at some point during the incident, Goodson brandished a gun at officers. He was shot and later pronounced dead, according to the statement. “I know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included. Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast,” Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement. The investigation has been turned over to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. “S-Town,” the 2017 podcast, features a man by the name of John B. McLemore who tells the story of murder, money, outcasts and mystery in the town of Woodstock.

The attorney generalâs report concluded that Deputy Michael Lyman âreasonably believedâ that Trevor A. Caouette posed an âimminent threat of serious bodily injury or deathâ during the early morning incident on March 26, 2021. Caouette, 27, of Skowhegan, ignored at least two commands to drop a 9 mm Glock and instead continued pointing the pistol at responding officers as he walked toward them, according to the report. âMr. Caouetteâs gun was aimed at the officers for over a minute before Deputy Lyman fired at Mr. Caouette,â according to the report, which is dated Sept. 22 and was released Friday, Dec. 1. âAll the facts and circumstances point to the conclusion that Deputy Lyman acted in defense (of himself and another deputy) â¦ at the time he used deadly force.â Following the shooting, Caouette was treated and released from the hospital, and charged with two counts of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon. The shooting occurred on Mechanic Street in downtown Norridgewock while deputies were investigating a reported vehicle crash. Caouetteâs fiancÃ©e had called 911 at 12:40 a.m. to report the man was intoxicated, had a 9 mm Glock handgun and was possibly driving around the âNorridgewock loop.â Shortly after that, a pair of calls came in to Somerset County dispatchers reporting a truck crash on Skowhegan Road. Deputy Lyman responded and found the red truck crashed about 60 feet off the road in the woods, but Caouette was not there. Other officers arrived with a police dog to track Caouetteâs scent. Meanwhile, another sheriffâs deputy spotted Caouette at a Cumberland Farms store parking lot, at the intersection of routes 2 and 139 in Norridgewock. Police descended on the scene, as did Caouetteâs fiancÃ©e, who confronted and argued with him. Caouette then pulled out the gun and started walking down the middle of nearby Mechanic Street. A sheriffâs office cruiser camera âshows Mr. Caouette walking towards the officers, both hands extended with a pistol pointing in their direction,â the report states. Lyman fired two shots at Caouette after he ignored commands to drop his gun. Caouette was taken to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, where he underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to the abdomen. He pleaded guilty July 21, 2021, to two Class C charges of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to nine months in prison. Online records for the stateâs Department of Corrections show Caouette has since been released. Lyman is still working at the Somerset County Sheriffâs Office, according to Sheriff Dale Lancaster. Also on Friday, the attorney generalâs office released a separate report on a shooting that occurred earlier this year in the Penobscot County town of Alton. In that case, a review of the May 26 incident found that Corporal Blaine Silk of the Maine State Police was justified when he shot and injured Djvan Carter, 46, of Milford, after the man attempted to run the officer over with a vehicle. The attorney generalâs office has released 13 reports on police shootings this year, regarding incidents since 2019. All found the use of deadly force was justified.

Murray had Type 1 diabetes and was aware of the impact of the disease on his physical and mental health, his aunt, Liz Belcaster, said at an emotional Monday news conference. He had a yearslong history of becoming erratic when his insulin levels were low and called Elk Grove police in the past when he needed help. “He knew there was times when he needed help quickly, and he believed police could help him as they had in the past,” Belcaster said. “We don’t know what took place on Friday afternoon, but we know our family deserves answers.” [ Elk Grove Village police fatally shoot man while responding to report of man with knife ] Elk Grove Village police fatally shot Murray Friday while responding to a call of a man with a knife. A neighbor reported a man leaving a house holding a knife. Someone inside the house had previously called the police, Deputy Chief of Police Christopher Torres told the Tribune on Friday. Murray was still holding the knife as a confrontation ensued, Torres said. An Elk Grove Village officer shot Murray around 4:30 p.m., and he was pronounced dead Friday night at Ascension Alexian Brothers Hospital. Elk Grove police provided body-worn camera footage and vehicle camera footage to the Major Case Assistance Team, which is conducting an independent investigation into the shooting, Torres said in a statement Monday evening. Five of the responding officers have been placed on temporary leave until the investigation is complete, Torres said. The officer who shot Murray has not been identified. Attorney Antonio Romanucci of Romanucci & Blandin, who the Murray family hired to represent them, said he is asking Elk Grove police to publicly release bodycam footage from Friday and from their previous encounters with Murray on behalf of his clients. Torres said Elk Grove police will release the footage “after crucial investigative steps have been taken.” “We know that sharing this information in a transparent way will help our community better understand the events that unfolded last Friday afternoon,” Torres said in the statement. The Murray family believes Jack Murray was the person who called police, Romanucci said. Murray’s parents, Tom and Donna, and his siblings, Shannon and Ryan, were also present at the news conference but did not address reporters. The family was overcome with emotion as Romanucci said that police refused to let them see Jack Murray when he was in the hospital before he died. Shannon Murray held her mother in an embrace as she cried out for her son. Tom Murray removed his glasses to wipe away tears. Jack Murray also occasionally checked himself into the hospital for his mental health struggles, Romanucci said. Afternoon Briefing The investigation launched by Romanucci’s firm will focus on whether the officers who responded to the 911 call were trained in and attempted de-escalation techniques. “If he was having an emotional disturbance as a result of his Type 1 diabetes, his behavior, it might have been erratic or unpredictable, and that’s why you need de-escalation techniques. That’s why you need crisis intervention training,” Romanucci said. Romanucci and the family did not say when Jack Murray was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Torres had said that Jack Murray lived in Elk Grove Village, but he also kept an address in Edgewater, according to the medical examiner’s office."

The footage, released in conjunction with the Inspector General’s preliminary report on the shooting, shows officers with the West Haven Police Department asking 33-year-old Jovan Washington to put on a pair of pants before he is taken into custody Friday in an apartment on Terrace Avenue when he suddenly reaches under a mattress and grabs a firearm. Officers had been called to the apartment at 1:55 a.m. in connection with a domestic violence complaint in which a woman alleged that Washington tried to strangle her and would not let her leave the apartment, according to the preliminary report. Police found Washington in bed in a bedroom in the apartment and asked him if he wished to put on a pair of pants before he was taken into custody, the bodycam footage shows. Washington can be seen in the footage facing a closet when he suddenly turns back toward the bed, reaches under the mattress and grabs a handgun. Officers immediately struggle with Washington to wrestle the gun away before one shot is heard, according to the footage. An officer calls out “shots fired, shots fired” as police continue to struggle to get the gun away from Washington, at which point three more shots can be heard before Washington grimaces in pain, the footage shows. The struggle over the gun continues for several more seconds as officers yell “drop the gun, drop the gun, drop it.” One more shot can be heard before an officer is able to grab the firearm away from Washington, who continues to groan in pain, the footage shows. An officer can be heard saying “I’m hit.” According to the Inspector General’s preliminary report, Washington fired one shot during the incident, striking West Haven Officer Cody Bacon in the leg. Officer Alex Triscritti then shot Washington multiple times during the struggle, the report said. Officers provided medical aid to Washington before medics arrived and took him to Yale New Haven Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the report. Bacon was also taken to the hospital and treated for a gunshot wound to his upper leg. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner determined Washington died of gunshot wounds to his torso and extremities and ruled the death a homicide. The Inspector General said Tuesday the toxicology report for Washington is not yet available. The state Office of Inspector General, in accordance with the police accountability law, will investigate to determine if Triscritti’s use of deadly force was justified. The investigation is being assisted by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, Connecticut State Police Central District Major Crime Squad, West Haven police and the Ansonia-Milford Judicial District State’s Attorney’s Office."

Canandaigua Police Chief Mathew Nielsen said Thomas D. Johnson, 34, of Elmira, was charged Thursday with menacing a police officer. He was arrested by city police and the Ontario County sheriffâs warrant unit after he was indicted by a county grand jury. The charge stems from an incident on the afternoon of May 1. City police were dispatched after a call about a suspicious person at the 7-Eleven on South Main Street. Officers encountered Johnson, who displayed what appeared to be a handgun from his front jacket pocket. Officers gave several verbal commands for Johnson to show his hands. State police, who led the investigation, said Johnson ignored the commands and walked toward South Main Street. Officers made multiple attempts to discharge their Tasers, without effect. Police said while officers were yelling for Johnson to comply he turned toward police, removed the gun from his pocket, and pointed it at an officer. An officer shot Johnson; that officer hasnât been named. State police did not say where Johnson, who was listed as living in Canandaigua at the time, was hit by the gunfire. Aid was rendered at the scene and Johnson was taken by a Mercy Flight Central helicopter to Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. He was charged at the time with a misdemeanor menacing count. Police said the gun Johnson displayed was an Airsoft pistol. The investigation also involved the county district attorneyâs office and the state Attorney Generalâs office. Johnson was taken to the county jail for arraignment."

Authorities in Dallas say a 21-year-old man fatally shot himself while being pursued by officers about 200 miles away from where he killed four people, including a 1-year-old boy, and injured a 15-year-old girl in a shooting.

The announcement is a sharp reversal for Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, a progressive who was elected months after the protests and ran on promises to hold police accountable in the Texas capital. Garza, a Democrat, said his office would dismiss indictments against 17 officers but still move forward with prosecuting four others. The slate of felony charges was by far the most indictments of officers from a single U.S. police department following nationwide protests in 2020 over racial injustice and police brutality. Some Austin police officers fired beanbag rounds in the crowd, critically injuring one teenager. ""This has been a difficult chapter for Austin. I look forward to turning the page. These announcements will allow police officers, whose lives were upended by the indictments, to return to their services to our community,” said Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat who was not in office at the time of the protests. Get DFW local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC DFW newsletters. In a statement, Garza did not explain why he was deciding to drop most of the cases. Many of the officers were indicted in February 2022, none had gone to trial and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had floated the idea of pardons after the charges were handed down by a grand jury. Garza said his office “would continue to hold law enforcement who break the law accountable."" In a letter to the Justice Department, Garza asked prosecutors to review Austin police’s use of force for crowd control during the protests. Ken Ervin, an attorney who represents nine officers whose charges will be dismissed, called the indictments a “combination of politics and incompetence.” Texas News News from around the state of Texas. “Mr. Garza has not really taken the chance to educate himself on police tactics,” Ervin said. ""Maybe he’s finally done that.” Despite widespread claims of heavy-handed or even illegal police tactics across the U.S. following the 2020 protests, few cities pursued charges. Two Dallas officers faced charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and official oppression, and a New York police officer was charged with assault after shoving a woman to the ground. In October, a former Minneapolis police officer was sentenced to 15 days in the county workhouse, with eligibility for electronic home monitoring, after pleading guilty to assaulting a Black man during the unrest that followed Floyd's murder. The City of Austin has paid out more than $18 million to settle lawsuits brought by protesters injured during the protests, including a college student who suffered brain damage after an officer shot him with a beanbag round. Eight other lawsuits are still pending, according to the city. Austin Police Association President Michael Bullock said prosecutors had yet to prove any case where any officer committed wrongdoing. “Our officers were faced with incredible and unprecedented challenges. In those extremely difficult times they acted within the law and upheld their oath to keep our city safe,” Bullock said. The indictments widened the rift in Austin between police and Garza, whose 2020 campaign was backed by liberal allies including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and promised crackdowns on misconduct by law enforcement. Garza was among a handful of progressive prosecutors who won office in 2020 when the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others sparked a national outcry over law enforcement’s treatment of Black people. He said the charges in Austin were not politically driven and emphasized that his office prosecuted more than 30 non-officers who also participated in the protests. The announcement by Garza comes weeks after a mistrial was declared in a high-profile trial involving an Austin police officer who was charged with murder in the death of Michael Ramos, who was unarmed and shot as he tried to drive away from police who were attempting to arrest him in April 2020. The case was prosecuted by Garza's office and ended after jurors were unable to reach a verdict. Weeks after Ramos' death, demonstrators in Austin invoked his name when they took to the streets to protest the killing of Floyd."

Joseph âTylerâ Goodson, 32, was shot and killed by police when he barricaded himself inside a house in Woodstock early Sunday, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) told The Post. At about 1:39 a.m. Sunday, Goodson posted a haunting final Facebook update that read âpolice bout [sic] to shoot me down in my own yard,ââ WIAT reported. Multiple law enforcement agencies descended on the Woodstock property after receiving a âcall for service,â the ALEA explained. As of Tuesday, it was not clear exactly what incident prompted the initial call. The ALEA is reviewing the shooting and will turn its findings over to the Bibb County district attorney. Goodson shot to national notoriety six years ago when he was featured in the podcast âS-Town,â the Peabody Award-winning series produced by the team behind âSerialâ and âThis American Life.â The podcast chronicled antique clock restorer and Woodstock native John B. McLemore and his complicated relationship with the area â which he referred to as âsât town,â prompting the showâs abbreviated title. McLemore died by suicide in 2015 at age 49 â two years before âS-Townâ hit the airwaves. Goodson appeared on the podcast as one of Woodstockâs residents and something of a mentee of McLemoreâs. âBecause you know, I ainât ever had no daddy worth a damn. Heâs just about the only daddy Iâve got,â Goodson said of the older man in the podcast’s third episode. After the podcast debuted, however, Goodsonâs life appeared to spiral into chaos: In June 2017, he pleaded guilty to multiple counts of burglary and theft for taking items from McLemoreâs property after he died, WIAT noted. Goodson claimed that McLemore had left the items â including cars and tattoo equipment â to him. He ultimately pleaded guilty to a suspended sentence that included five yearsâ probation. The town is now waiting for âanswers and detailsâ about Goodsonâs death, Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement Monday. âPlease remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him,â Dodson asked the public. âThis young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many,â he concluded. At the time of his death, Goodson was believed to have five children, WIAT said. With Post wires"

Austin Police say there were four buses making eight trips each that shuttled students to the Delco Center. Students waited inside the Delco gymnasium, as family members began to arrive to pick them up. Because of the sheer volume of students, many parents found themselves stuck in traffic that was backed up well down Manor Road. Once they arrived and parked, many family members stood in line once again, waiting for word that their student had arrived. ""It is kind of frustrating, but at least I already know she's alive, not waiting to find a dead body. So I’m feeling okay,"" said Lydia Chavez, who was waiting in line for her niece to arrive. ""Oh, I was so relieved that she was okay. I know she's probably scared in her head, but I know she's okay in her heart."" Northeast High School mother Shay Galloway says it was agonizing having to wait several hours after hearing about the shooting, to pick up her son. ""My best friend had to tell me to calm down, to get my mind right, because all I was thinking was to come get my child. That's the only thing,"" said Galloway.

(WLNS) — Lansing Police Department on Sunday released the name of the victim in Friday-night’s police shooting. In a news conference, Chief Ellery Sosebee said LPD had shot and killed 33-year-old Stephen Romero after they responded to a reported domestic dispute. He said LPD will release body camera footage from incident soon. Romero’s family did not want to go on camera, but they said they have hired a lawyer. 6 News on Sunday spoke with a neighbor of the family from two houses down, who recalled the events leading up to the shooting incident. “I woke up to a loud bang. A couple of loud bangs,” Sean Fidler said. “And then I stepped outside and seen a whole bunch of police.” Fidler recalls, “You know, I went back in the house and called it a night. And then caught the news the next day to see what happened.” He said he had seen Romero just a few days before with one of his children. “He was out here with his daughter,” Romero said. “Walking her in her stroller. It’s just sad that all this happened. You know, it really is.” Since the time of the deadly shooting, 6 News has received updates from police and from Romero’s family. “They were trying to put him in custody, and a gun was presented,” LPD Chief Sosebee said in the news conference on Sunday. LPD had said a female, who was present at the time of the shooting, had called dispatch about a domestic situation. A second caller then alleged that the woman had been shot. When police arrived, officers said they told Romero to put up his hands–and that’s when they saw a gun. A reporter at the news conference asked whether Romero had shot at officers. His response was, “I’m not going to share any of that information at this point.” Sosebee also declined to share at the news conference whether anyone else had been injured in the incident, though no other injuries have been reported. Police discovered before beginning CPR on Romero that the woman involved had not been shot after all, according to Sosebee’s statement. 6 News spoke to Romero’s wife off-camera. She said the Detroit-based Geoffrey Fieger Law Firm is representing the family, and that police should not have shot her husband. Neighbor Sean Fidler has a message for the family: “My condolences. I’m sorry. It’s a tragedy; it really is.” The two officers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure in such cases. Michigan State Police is handling the investigation."

The announcement is a sharp reversal for Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, a progressive who was elected months after the protests and ran on promises to hold police accountable in the Texas capital. Garza, a Democrat, said his office would dismiss indictments against 17 officers but still move forward with prosecuting four others. The slate of felony charges were by far the most indictments of officers from a single U.S. police department following nationwide protests in 2020 over racial injustice and police brutality. Some Austin police officers fired beanbag rounds in the crowd, critically injuring one teenager. “This has been a difficult chapter for Austin. I look forward to turning the page. These announcements will allow police officers, whose lives were upended by the indictments, to return to their services to our community,” said Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat who was not in office at the time of the protests. In a statement, Garza did not explain why he was deciding now to drop most of the cases. Many of the officers were indicted in February 2022, none had gone to trial and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had floated the idea of pardons after the charges were handed down by a grand jury. Garza said his office “would continue to hold law enforcement who break the law accountable.” In a letter to the Justice Department, Garza asked prosecutors to review Austin police’s use of force for crowd control during the protests. Ken Ervin, an attorney who represents nine officers whose charges will be dismissed, called the indictments a “combination of politics and incompetence.” “Mr. Garza has not really taken the chance to educate himself on police tactics,” Ervin said. “Maybe he’s finally done that.” Despite widespread claims of heavy-handed or even illegal police tactics across the U.S. following the 2020 protests, few cities pursued charges. Two Dallas officers faced charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and official oppression, and a New York police officer was charged with assault after shoving a woman to the ground. In October, a former Minneapolis police officer was sentenced to 15 days in the county workhouse, with eligibility for electronic home monitoring, after pleading guilty to assaulting a Black man during the unrest that followed Floyd’s murder. The City of Austin has paid out more than $18 million to settle lawsuits brought by protesters injured during the protests, including a college student who suffered brain damage after an officer shot him with a beanbag round. Eight other lawsuits are still pending, according to the city. Austin Police Association President Michael Bullock said prosecutors had yet to prove any case where any officer committed wrongdoing. “Our officers were faced with incredible and unprecedented challenges. In those extremely difficult times they acted within the law and upheld their oath to keep our city safe,” Bullock said. The indictments widened the rift in Austin between police and Garza, whose 2020 campaign was backed by liberal allies including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and promised crackdowns on misconduct by law enforcement. Garza was among a handful of progressive prosecutors who won office in 2020, when the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others sparked a national outcry over law enforcement’s treatment of Black people. He said the charges in Austin were not politically driven and emphasized that his office prosecuted more than 30 non-officers who also participated in the protests. The announcement by Garza comes weeks after a mistrial was declared in a high-profile trial involving an Austin police officer who was charged with murder in the death of Michael Ramos, who was unarmed and shot as he tried to drive away from police who were attempting to arrest him in April 2020. The case was prosecuted by Garza’s office and ended after jurors were unable to reach a verdict. Weeks after Ramos’ death, demonstrators in Austin invoked his name when they took to the streets to protest the killing of Floyd.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced the charges against Joel and Tammy Brown and Jerry and Tamal Flore, all of Dewitt, on Monday. The charges, filed in Clinton County, arise from evidence of abuse against eight of the dozens of children adopted through their homes since 2007. Nearly 30 children have been either adopted or fostered through the Brown and Flore homes, Nessel said. Joel Brown, a 54-year-old former Michigan Department of Health and Human Services employee who worked within the Childrenâs Services Agency Office of Advocate for Children, Youth and Families, is among those charged. Five counts against him include first-degree child abuse, conspiracy to commit second-degree child abuse, third degree child abuse, interfering with a crime report and failure to report child abuse. Tammy Brown, 53, is charged with three counts including first-degree child abuse, conspiracy to commit second-degree child abuse and third-degree child abuse. Jerry Flore, 58, faces 11 counts including first degree child abuse, first degree child abuse committed in the presence of another child, conspiracy to commit second-degree child abuse, second-degree child abuse and interfering with a crime report. Tamal Flore, 56, faces 17 counts including first-degree child abuse, first degree child abuse committed in the presence of another child, conspiracy to commit second-degree child abuse, second-degree child abuse, third degree child abuse and interfering with a crime report. It is alleged that Joel Brown used his expertise in the field of child abuse investigations and child protection laws to circumvent detection of the ongoing child abuse in the homes. âChildren who end up in our foster care or adoption systems are often already coming from unbelievably vulnerable situations and deserve our utmost care,â Nessel said. âThe Brown and Flore families preyed upon dozens of children who were removed from previously abusive biological homes and subjected the children to prolonged routine and systemic mental and physical abuse under the guise of discipline. These two families have adopted or fostered at least 30 children toward an end of immense financial gain.â âThese egregious allegations highlight not only a moral and legal failure of those entrusted with the childrenâs care, but a failure in our systems to ensure children placed in custody are properly taken care of.â The Browns and Flores were previously charged for abuse allegations in Clinton County. In the previous Clinton County proceedings, prior charges against Tammy Brown and Joel Brown were dismissed and charges against Tamal Flore and Jerry Flore were reduced. Nesselâs office joined the investigation earlier this year and found sufficient evidence to charge all four defendants with the slew of crimes. As a result of the re-opened investigation, any outstanding charges against the defendants were subsequently dropped. Arrest warrants have been processed for all four defendants, who have until Friday to voluntarily turn themselves in, Nessel said.

Officers shot and killed Joseph Tyler Goodson, 32, of Woodstock, after he barricaded himself inside a home and ""brandished a gun"" at officers early Sunday, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency claimed. The agency's statement said the Woodstock Police Department initially responded to a ""call for service"" early Sunday and the standoff ensued. Multiple law enforcement agencies converged on the home. The state agency did not describe what led to the initial call to the home. ""Police bout to shoot me down in my own yard,"" a message posted early Sunday on Goodson's Facebook account read, according to news outlets WIAT and al.com. People are also reading… The state agency is reviewing the shooting and will turn its findings over to the Bibb County district attorney. The 2017 podcast, which won a Peabody Award, told the story of an Alabama man named John B. McLemore, who died before the show came out. McLemore's use of an expletive to describe his hometown gives the podcast its abbreviated title. ""S-Town"" begins telling the story of a reputed killing and another death but winds up focusing on McLemore and his tortured relationship with the town of Woodstock. Several people in his life were also featured, including Goodson. ""I know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included,"" Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement Monday. ""Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast. ""Please remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many,"" the mayor added. Woodstock, with a population of about 1,500 people, is about 35 miles southwest of Birmingham."

At a news conference on Sunday, France’s top anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said suspect Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab, a French national, recorded a video speaking in Arabic before the attack in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State group, used a name to introduce himself that referred to the Islamic State in Afghanistan and expressed support for Islamic extremists and jihadists operating in various areas around the world, including in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Egypt’s Sinai, Yemen, Iran and Pakistan. Ricard said Rajabpour-Miyandoab and three others, including family members and associates, were taken into police custody for questions after the attack. On Sunday, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a special cabinet meeting with key ministers and officials charged with security “to provide a full update on the security arrangements in place, the treatment of the most dangerous individuals and the aftermath of this fatal attack,” her office said, according to The New York Times. Rajabpour-Miyandoab could face a preliminary charge of murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise, Ricard said. PARIS STABBING SUSPECT WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER PREVIOUS ISLAMIC TERROR PLOT: FRENCH MINISTER The prosecutor said the video was published on Rajabpour-Miyandoa’s account on X, which was opened last month, and his recent posts included references to the Israel-Hamas war. Rajabpour-Miyandoab was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris, in a family with no religious affiliation. He converted to Islam at the age of 18 and quickly adhered to Islamic extremist ideology, according to Ricard. In 2016, he had planned to join the Islamic State group in Syria. The same year, he was convicted and imprisoned for four years, until 2020, on a charge of planning violence. He was under psychiatric treatment and was on a special list for feared radicals, the prosecutor confirmed. Since a probation period during which he received mandatory psychiatric care ended earlier this year, Rajabpour-Miyandoab was placed under the surveillance of intelligence services, Ricard said. In October, his mother expressed “concerns” over her son isolating himself, but no evidence was found that could have led to criminal proceedings, he added. Speaking to broadcaster BFMTV, Darmanin said Monday that around one-third of suspected radicals under surveillance have psychiatric issues, arguing that authorities should be given greater powers to force psychiatric treatment on people in such cases. “There appears to have been a psychiatric failing because doctors on multiple occasions decided that he was better, that he was more normal and could live freely,” the interior minister said of Rajabpour-Miyandoab, specifically. Rajabpour-Miyandoab reportedly stopped to ask a German couple for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the 22-year-old male victim, aiming at the head, then the back. SUSPECT IN ATTACK THAT KILLED TOURIST IN PARIS REPORTEDLY SHOUTED ‘ALLAHU AKBAR’ “He knew where to strike,” emergency physician Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV. A taxi driver reportedly stopped to intervene, and as police pursued the suspect, he ran across a bridge and injured two more people, a Frenchman and a British citizen, with a hammer. Authorities said Rajabpour-Miyandoab shouted “Allahu Akbar,” or “God is great” while being taken into custody. Ricard said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with one of the two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray. He said the suspect was also in touch with the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia’s Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. Three years earlier, another teacher, Samuel Paty, was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. Six teenagers are currently on trial in Paris for allegedly inciting the murder after Paty showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class during a discussion on secularism and freedom of expression. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The attack near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the River Sienne. Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra insisted Monday that France was capable of safeguarding the opening festivities. “We don’t have a Plan B. There is a Plan A within which there are several sub-plans,” Oudéa-Castéra said on France Inter radio. The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling said he would be holding hearings on Monday concerning the four officers involved in the shooting. However, in a release on Tuesday, he said, “Our goal continues to be to complete the hearings process by the end of this work week and provide an update as to my determinations at that time.” Decatur Council President Jacob Ladner said during Monday’s regular City Council meeting that Bowling would not attend the meeting, because the hearings are ongoing. Ladner said residents should expect to hear the results of those hearings “in the coming days.” A News 19 crew in the council chambers said there was an outburst of disapproval in the chamber after Ladner’s announcement. Perkins was killed by police in the early morning hours of Sept. 29th, following an incident surrounding a vehicle repossession. The mayor announced on Nov. 20 that he had tentatively scheduled disciplinary hearings on Dec. 4 for each of the officers involved in the incident. That followed Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion’s announcement that he had reprimanded four officers for violations of department policy in the Perkins shooting. The chief said in a statement at the time that he felt disciplinary action was warranted and that he had sent his report and findings to both the city’s legal department and outside counsel in order to move forward in the process. That left the disciplinary process in the hands of the mayor. The Decatur discipline process for Police Department employees starts with a predetermination hearing, a review to determine if policies have been violated. In this case it resulted in four reprimands, according to the police department. The next step is this week’s determination hearings before Mayor Bowling — which could lead to officer discipline, including possible suspension or firing. If there is a disciplinary action, there are appeal rights — an employee objecting to the decision can appeal within seven days to the city’s personnel board for review. The period since Bowling announced the hearing date has been far from quiet. On Nov. 28, supporters of Stephen Perkins and his family voiced frustration at a Decatur City Council meeting over with how long the discipline process was taking. Many of the nearly two dozen residents who spoke at the meeting said their patience was growing thin and they called for discipline for the officers involved. And last week, Decatur City Councilman Hunter Pepper sent an email to city employees expressing support for the officers and suggesting Bowling was moving too quickly in pursuing discipline for the officers. In the email obtained by News 19, Pepper said the officers followed their training on the night of the shooting. The councilman also claimed three officers involved had been told the mayor intended to terminate them and put a fourth on non-paid suspension. Bowling told News 19 after the letter was sent out that he would only decide on any disciplinary action after the hearings and that any suggestion otherwise was false."

Both of the injured officers left a hospital in Queens Sunday evening. The two police officers were hospitalized after they were stabbed by Courtney Gordon. Gordon, who police officials described as a ""madman,"" was shot and killed after attacking two officers outside a home in a Rockaway section of the Queens borough of New York. Earlier in day, the police officers responded to a home after Gordon reportedly stabbed five family members and set the home on fire. Police officials said four of those family members, including two children died. Investigators said Gordon allegedly killed an 11-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, and a man in his thirties. He also allegedly stabbed and critically wounded a 61-year-old woman. Gordon was confronted outside the home by the two policers. They reportedly asked Gordon if he knew what was going on when moments later he pulled out a knife and attacked the two officers. The police officers shot and killed Gordon. Dozens of police officers stood outside Jamaica Hospital Medical Center cheer the injured officers while they were escorted New York police are still investigating the case."

Dozens traveled to Castlemanâs parentsâ home in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Tivâon to attend his shiva, the traditional seven-day Jewish mourning period, as anger has grown across the country at the circumstances leading to his death. Castleman, a former police officer, was driving to work Thursday when he saw two gunmen open fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem. Moments later, he had rushed to the scene. âHe saw the attack, and he just stopped his car, got out of his car, took his gun out, and he just charged at the terrorists and he killed them both,â Guy Itzkovich, Castlemanâs friend, told CNN at the shiva. A video showed two uniformed soldiers scrambling out of a red car and grabbing their guns. A third person, an army reservist according to Israelâs military, appears to have mistakenÂ Castleman for an attackerÂ andÂ began shootingÂ at him.Â Bullets from one of the Israeli soldiers may have also struck Castleman, the IDF said. âWhen the soldiers saw him Iâm assuming they thought he was a terrorist. But then when Yuval realized that thatâs what theyâre thinking, he opened his jacket to show he had nothing underneath, and got down on his knees. He opened his hands, so they could see he had nothing in his hands,â said Itkovich. âHe was shouting in Hebrew. He was shouting âIâm an Israeli.â He threw his wallet, his identification, on the way so they could see heâs an Israeli. And they just shot him. They gunned him down,â he said. Castleman died at the Shaare Zedek medical center later Thursday. Three other victims were killed in the attack, for which Hamas claimed responsibility. At Castlemanâs shiva Monday, his father Moshe praised his âheroicâ son. âYuval did what he was expected to doÂ because all his life he was that sort of person,â he told CNN. âHe was trained in the security environment and he did what was requested of him because itâs decreed that we have to help one another.â Moshe said there should be an investigation into his sonâs fatal shooting âto prevent such a thing happening again.â Itzkovich, who served in the police alongside Castleman, accused the soldier who shot him of violating protocols. âThereâs certain things that youâre not supposed to do. Even if Yuval was a terrorist â even if the citizen that they thought was a terrorist was a terrorist â the man had surrendered,â Itzkovich said. âBy these protocols, theyâre supposed to arrest him. He should never have been shot.â Itzkovich expressed his disbelief that the soldier had âignoredâ the protocols he said are drilled into those serving in the Israeli police and military. âThey taught us in the army, and in the police force, that the protocols are very, very strict. Itâs like a mantra,â he said. âIf you wake me up at 4 in the morning, I will tell you exactly what those protocols are. I trust the army, and I trust the police force, and I know that they gave the orders exactly as they gave it to me, when I was there. And this guy, this soldier â he ignored them. Itâs not that he didnât know them, he just ignored them. And that was what my friend got killed for. Itâs devastating.â The IDF originally said it would not investigate the incident. But, amid widespread media coverage of Castlemanâs death, Israel Police said they would investigate it, and the IDF then said it would join the investigation because the suspect in the killing is a soldier. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said he felt âdeep sorrowâ for Castlemanâs âtragic death.â âThe IDF has clear instructions on how and when to shoot, and all of this is very clear. And thereâs a clear moral rule – when someone puts their hand up – he should not be shot,â he also said, cautioning that âuntil the investigation is not over, we cannot indict a person. We have to wait for its outcomes.â Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called for a âthorough inquiryâ into the shooting, describing Castleman as âa hero of Israel.â But that call followed an earlier statement by Netanyahu that prompted fury in parts of Israel. In a widely panned comment on the incident, Netanyahu defended the right for Israeli citizens to bear arms and suggested that some civilian deaths were the âpriceâ that came with such a policy. âThatâs life,â he said. âWe know that during upticks of terror over the past decade, and even before that, having armed civilians often saved lives and prevented a bigger catastrophe,â Netanyahu said in a press conference to Tel Aviv on Saturday night. âUnder the current circumstances, we should continue with this policy, I surely support it. We might have to pay prices, but thatâs life.â Asked for his response to Netanyahuâs comments, Castlemanâs father said he would not discuss them âbecause the Prime Minister spoke later and corrected what he had said, and after he understood what had happened, he said that my son was a hero â and thatâs exactly how it was.â Applications to carry privateÂ firearms in Israel surged in the month following the Hamas attack on October 7, according to the Ministry of National Security. As of October 30, the ministry had received 180,500 new applications with its centers receiving an average of 10,000 new requests per day â compared to 850 new requests per week prior to the terror attacks. Israelâs Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir has voiced his desire for moreÂ IsraelisÂ to carryÂ firearms. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Officials said the ASP Criminal Investigation Division is reviewing the officer-involved shooting of the suspect, who Jacksonville Police Department investigators claimed committed an armed robbery at the Waffle House on Marshall Road late Sunday night. Jacksonville police officials said officers responded to the restaurant around 11:40 p.m. and claimed the suspect ran into a nearby wooded area while firing a gun at officers. During that exchange, department officials said the officers returned fire. Investigators said no officers or anyone in restaurant were injured, but they noted that the suspect did sustain a non-life-threatening injury. The suspect was taken to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences for treatment. There are currently no charges officially filed against that suspect in this case. ASP agents said a case file will be developed on this investigation and presented to the local prosecuting attorning, who will determine if the use of force was justified in this case."

(AP) — A man featured in the hit podcast “S-Town” that chronicled events in a rural Alabama community was shot and killed by police during a weekend standoff in the town, authorities said Monday. Joseph Tyler Goodson, 32, of Woodstock, was shot and killed by officers after he barricaded himself inside a home and “brandished a gun” at officers early Sunday, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. The agency’s statement said the Woodstock Police Department had initially responded to a “call for service” early Sunday and the standoff ensued. Multiple law enforcement agencies converged on the home. The statement said Goodson was shot by officers during the confrontation and was subsequently pronounced dead. The state agency did not describe what led to the initial call to the home. “Police bout to shoot me down in my own yard,” a message posted early Sunday on Goodson’s Facebook account read, news outlets, WIAT and al.com reported. The state agency is reviewing the shooting and will turn its findings over to the Bibb County district attorney. The 2017 podcast, which won a Peabody Award, told the story of an Alabama man named John B. McLemore, who died by suicide before the show came out. McLemore’s use of an expletive to describe his hometown gives the podcast its abbreviated title. “S-Town” begins telling the story of a reputed killing and also another death and winds up focusing on the eccentric McLemore, a restorer of antique clocks, and his tortured relationship with the town of Woodstock. Several people in his life were also featured, including Goodson. “Because you know, I ain’t ever had no daddy worth a damn. He’s just about the only daddy I’ve got,” Goodson said of McLemore in the the third episode of the podcast. Woodstock, with a population of about 1,500 people, is located about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of the major city of Birmingham. “I know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included,” Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement Monday. “Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast. “Please remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many,” the mayor added. Julie Synder, the executive producer of “S-Town” declined to immediately comment when reached by email. Goodson in 2017 received a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to burglary and theft charges accusing him of taking items from McLemore’s property after his death. Goodson, before pleading guilty, had maintained he was retrieving items that belonged to him. Goodson told The Associated Press in 2017 that the podcast had brought a deluge of attention on him and the town, but neither have done him any favors. “It’s a sad story, especially if you’re part of it,” Goodson said."

The announcement is a sharp reversal for Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, a progressive who was elected months after the protests and ran on promises to hold police accountable in the Texas capital. Garza, a Democrat, said his office would dismiss indictments against 17 officers but still move forward with prosecuting four others. The slate of felony charges were by far the most indictments of officers from a single U.S. police department following nationwide protests in 2020 over racial injustice and police brutality. Some Austin police officers fired beanbag rounds in the crowd, critically injuring one teenager. “This has been a difficult chapter for Austin. I look forward to turning the page. These announcements will allow police officers, whose lives were upended by the indictments, to return to their services to our community,” said Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat who was not in office at the time of the protests. In a statement, Garza did not explain why he was deciding now to drop most of the cases. Many of the officers were indicted in February 2022, none had gone to trial and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had floated the idea of pardons after the charges were handed down by a grand jury. Garza said his office “would continue to hold law enforcement who break the law accountable.” In a letter to the Justice Department, Garza asked prosecutors to review Austin police’s use of force for crowd control during the protests. Ken Ervin, an attorney who represents nine officers whose charges will be dismissed, called the indictments a “combination of politics and incompetence.” “Mr. Garza has not really taken the chance to educate himself on police tactics,” Ervin said. “Maybe he’s finally done that.” Despite widespread claims of heavy-handed or even illegal police tactics across the U.S. following the 2020 protests, few cities pursued charges. Two Dallas officers faced charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and official oppression, and a New York police officer was charged with assault after shoving a woman to the ground. In October, a former Minneapolis police officer was sentenced to 15 days in the county workhouse, with eligibility for electronic home monitoring, after pleading guilty to assaulting a Black man during the unrest that followed Floyd’s murder. The City of Austin has paid out more than $18 million to settle lawsuits brought by protesters injured during the protests, including a college student who suffered brain damage after an officer shot him with a beanbag round. Eight other lawsuits are still pending, according to the city. Austin Police Association President Michael Bullock said prosecutors had yet to prove any case where any officer committed wrongdoing. “Our officers were faced with incredible and unprecedented challenges. In those extremely difficult times, they acted within the law and upheld their oath to keep our city safe,” Bullock said. The indictments widened the rift in Austin between police and Garza, whose 2020 campaign was backed by liberal allies including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and promised crackdowns on misconduct by law enforcement. Garza was among a handful of progressive prosecutors who won office in 2020, when the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others sparked a national outcry over law enforcement’s treatment of Black people. He said the charges in Austin were not politically driven and emphasized that his office prosecuted more than 30 nonofficers who also participated in the protests. The announcement by Garza comes weeks after a mistrial was declared in a high-profile trial involving an Austin police officer who was charged with murder in the death of Michael Ramos, who was unarmed and shot as he tried to drive away from police who were attempting to arrest him in April 2020. The case was prosecuted by Garza’s office and ended after jurors were unable to reach a verdict. Weeks after Ramos’ death, demonstrators in Austin invoked his name when they took to the streets to protest the killing of Floyd."

On Wednesday, Nov. 29, at around 3:30 p.m., a man called 911 to report that someone pointed a gun at a tow-truck driver in the 3200 block of North Nellis Boulevard. The tow truck driver was attempting to tow the suspect’s vehicle because it was parked on private property, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Asst. Sheriff Jamie Prosser. Police identified the suspect as Cristhyan Vizcarra, 39. Vizcarra left in his vehicle before officers arrived on the scene. An LVMPD helicopter found Vizcarra “driving recklessly” in the area and followed him to the 3000 block of Ringe Lane, where he crashed the vehicle, Prosser said at a briefing. After crashing his vehicle, Vizcarra ran to a nearby tow yard where he stole a tow truck. The helicopter continued to follow him for about 20 minutes. He drove to the area of Sloan Lane and Slice Drive where he left the tow truck in the middle of the road. Vizcarra then ran toward the 5700 block of Sandtrap Court, where he entered a home. The LVMPD surrounded the home and residents were able to get out of the home unharmed, but Vizcarra refused to peacefully surrender, Prosser said. Metro police declared it a barricade situation, and SWAT and crisis negotiators were brought to the scene. Vizcarra got in contact with the crisis negotiators, making several suicidal threats and refusing to leave the residence, police said. At around 8:10 p.m., Vizcarra opened the garage door of the home and drove a motorcycle down the driveway. SWAT fired approximately 10 low lethal rounds at Vizcarra, causing him to fall off the motorcycle a few feet off the driveway, Prosser said. Vizcarra then got up and ran through the neighborhood with SWAT officers following behind him. An LVMPD drone followed him to the driveway of a residence in the 5700 block of Baffy Circle. SWAT officers, including Officer Coleman Oswald, 37, approached Vizcarra, telling him several times to drop his gun, Prosser said. Vizcarra then pointed his gun, wrapped in a shirt, toward the officers, which resulted in Oswald firing his weapon three times. Vizcarra fell to the ground and officers began life-saving measures. He was taken to a local hospital, where he underwent surgery. His condition was listed as stable as of Monday. Vizcarra faces the following charges: - 2 counts of assault with a deadly weapon - 2 counts of resisting with a firearm - 2 counts of grand larceny – auto - 1 count felony evading - 1 count of possession of a stolen vehicle - 1 count prohibited person in possession of a firearm Officer Oswald is assigned to the Homeland Security Special Operations Division, Special Weapons, and Tactics Bureau, according to police. He has been with the department since 2009. He was placed on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a review of the incident. This is the eighth officer-involved shooting for Metro in 2023."

This is the third time in the last four months the City of Syracuse has seen stolen vehicles leading to serious consequences. Now, the city is working to hold Kia and Hyundai accountable for the rash of car thefts that is now costing lives. It was early last Thursday morning around 3:30 a.m. when South Wilbur Avenue on the west side of Syracuse was the deadly end of a police chase. It claimed the life of 15-year-old Zy'Mier Zulueta. He was a 10th grader at PSLA at Fowler High School. Syracuse Police say he stole a Kia, then led officers on a chase before crashing into a stone wall. ""It breaks your heart because I have an almost 13-year-old,"" said Syracuse Common Councilor Chol Majok (D, 3rd district). Majok chairs the Public Safety Committee. He is also a father and says there is a larger issue at play. Parenting today has changed, tremendously changed and folks are looking to point their fingers to public programs, but there is no program that's 24/7. That's where parents have to step in and do what they need to do. For now, the city is doing what it can to deal with, what it calls, a public safety issue related to Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Last month, it joined a multi-city lawsuit against the two car manufacturers, claiming their cars are stolen at an alarming rate due to lack of basic anti-theft technology. Syracuse Police data shows that as of August, Kias and Hyundais account for around 41% of vehicles stolen in the city. The theft of those two car brands is up 500% compared to last year. ""I would hope that they're at a place where they realize that they messed up. These cars should not be that easy to steal,"" said Councilor Jimmy Monto (D, 5th district). Monto lives in Eastwood and represents that section of Syracuse. He says there has been a major spike in car thefts in his neighborhood, ""The residents are extremely frustrated. You think about what it means to have your car stolen,"" he said. Monto says his 70-year-old mother drives a Hyundai, and they block her car in the driveway overnight to prevent it from being stolen. He worries about the pattern of car theft in recent months. This is three times in recent months where we've seen someone get injured because there's a stolen car. So it starts with the theft of the car and very quickly escalates. It's scary. Last month, three teenage girls inside a stolen Hyundai on the northside of Syracuse were shot by the brother of the car's owner. In September, an Onondaga County sheriff's deputy shot and killed two Syracuse teenagers in a stolen Hyundai. Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh says the city is victim to the devastating consequences of Hyundai and Kia's preventable failures. He says the issues are the direct result of the manufacturer's decision to cut corners."

Footage obtained by Atlanta Black Star shows the moment a Cobb County officer struck 28-year-old Devonte Brown multiple times in August 2021, after he was pulled over for “driving erratically” in Marietta. In the video, Brown’s damaged vehicle is surrounded by police patrol cars at the scene, and it appears that his airbags were deployed. “Get your hands up,” McConnell repeated. “Get your f**king hands up!” Brown is still inside the car at this time. Moments later, Brown pressed on the gas, and the cop shot into his vehicle 12 times, civil rights attorney Harry Daniels said in a statement on Thursday, Nov. 30. Daniels argued that the officer was not “under immediate threat” when the officer opened fire. The officer then reported that shots were fired and requested first responders to the scene. About midway through the video, law enforcement officials approached Brown’s car. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation previously said he was transferred to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. “Devonte obviously got himself in a situation where he was being chased by police,” Daniels told WSB-TV. “Absolutely deadly force was not warranted in this case; I mean he was trapped. He couldn’t get away. He was blocked in. There’s no getting away and using deadly force in that situation it was completely uncalled for and in my opinion it was unlawful.” Source: ‘Wasn’t a Threat’: Newly Released Video Shows Georgia Cop Fatally Shooting Unarmed Black Man ‘Trapped’ In Car After Traffic Stop"

Courtney Gordon, 38, was seen on video dancing to Ed Sheeran’s “Perfect” on Thanksgiving — 10 days before he went on the deadly rampage at the Far Rockaway home on Beach 22nd St. that left four dead, seriously wounded his aunt and left two police officers with stab wounds. The footage was shot the same day the family sat down with him and asked him to move out just weeks after his aunt, Christine Watson, opened her home to her homeless nephew, who was suffering from severe mental health problems, according to a family friend. “Thanksgiving Day, they said, ‘After Thanksgiving, you have to leave,'” recounted the friend, Charmaine Taylor. “‘You can’t stay here anymore.’ That set him off.” The video was shot by Watson’s daughter, Suzette Taylor, who sang along and encouraged Gordon behind the camera as he swayed to the pop hit. “Do that! Do that!” Taylor whooped as she sang along to the chart-topping tune. Taylor, 44, was later stabbed to death by Gordon, along with her husband and two of her children, according to cops and family. Watson’s 16-year-old daughter survived the attack when she broke through a window and dialed 911 before Gordon set fire to the home. On Monday, family and friends confirmed that Watson was recovering from her injuries."

An aunt of Courtney Gordon, 38 — who was fatally shot by police Sunday after he injured two officers responding to a 911 call about his stabbing spree — said she had kicked him out of her Bronx home in February due to his increasingly concerning behavior. “It could have been me in the morgue,” Lillian Mckoy, a sister of Gordon’s mother, told The Post. Gordon had been visiting relatives on his father’s side in Far Rockaway when he stabbed four of them to death early on Sunday — including an 11-year-old girl, 12-year-old boy and their parents — before he lit a couch on fire and attempted to slink away, police and family said. He also injured another another relative in the bloodbath, Christine Gordon, 63, an aunt on his dad’s side, who was hospitalized in critical condition. Mckoy, who allowed Gordon to live with her for several years, said the first red flags she noticed were that he changed the locks on the door to her house and asked her to remove her security cameras. âIf youâre gonna tell me I need to move my cameras, that tells me something,” she said. “I didnât like the demeanor. The way he looked at me. The attitude. He was not the same person I knew when he came from Jamaica.â She and her son, Sean Mckoy, 34, both described Gordon â a father of three who recently got divorced â as being someone quick to anger, who would not take no for an answer. âItâs just every single time, something would trigger him to go mad. He would start yelling at everybody. He would be very loud,” Sean, who was the best man at Gordon’s wedding, told The Post. âMy mom had to get him out of here, he was yelling at my mom. Always asking why we had cameras. Seemed like he probably wanted to do something to us,” he said. According to his aunt, his poor attitude and stubbornness were part of the reason why he struggled to keep a job and was in and out of homeless shelters. âThe whole issue with Courtney was that you could not correct him. And that was the issue with jobs. If someone tried to correct him, he would just walk off the job,” she said. “Whatever you say, he sees it differently.” His attitude and unwillingness to take advice from those around him prevented him from receiving much-needed mental health care, his relatives noted. âHis sister, Nicole, called an institution and let them know that her brother has mental issues and he needed help. They did come. I witnessed that. He did not want to go,” his aunt said. “He said there was nothing wrong with him. Theyâre the ones that are crazy. But the family did reach out to get him help.â The grief-stricken aunt, who worked in mental health care before she retired, said Gordon’s sister Nicole called her on Sunday and told her he had killed their aunt on the other side of the family. âI know the family reached out for him to get help. And unfortunately, he took so many lives,” she added. Police responded to the Far Rockaway home around 5:10 a.m. after the young girl called 911 and said her cousin âwas killing her family members.â Cops confronted Gordon as he attempted to leave the home — which he’d set on fire — with luggage in tow, but within about 10 seconds, he lunged at the officers with a knife, stabbing one in the neck and another in the head, police officials said Sunday. One of the injured cops, a 28-year veteran, identified by sources as Edmond Decio, shot Gordon dead, cops said. Both Decio and the other officer were hospitalized and released later Sunday. After firefighters arrived and put out the blaze, officers discovered the 11-year-old girl with fatal stab wounds just outside the two-story home on Beach 22nd Street near Elk Drive. Three other victims, including the 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman and a man in his 30s — believed to be Christine Gordon’s daughter, daughter’s husband and their kids — were found dead inside of the home, also stabbed to death, cops said. Courtney Gordon was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead upon his arrival, police said. Cops have not provided a motive for the horrific attack. Police also have not released the identities of the victims, but said they all appeared to have been related."

Joseph Tyler Goodson, 32, of Woodstock, was shot and killed by officers after he barricaded himself inside a home and “brandished a gun"" at officers early Sunday, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. The agency's statement said the Woodstock Police Department had initially responded to a “call for service” early Sunday and the standoff ensued. Multiple law enforcement agencies converged on the home. The statement said Goodson was shot by officers during the confrontation and was subsequently pronounced dead.

The state agency did not describe what led to the initial call to the home. “Police bout to shoot me down in my own yard,” a message posted early Sunday on Goodson's Facebook account read, news outlets, WIAT and al.com reported. The state agency is reviewing the shooting and will turn its findings over to the Bibb County district attorney. U.S. & World The 2017 podcast, which won a Peabody Award, told the story of an Alabama man named John B. McLemore, who died by suicide before the show came out. McLemore's use of an expletive to describe his hometown gives the podcast its abbreviated title. “S-Town” begins telling the story of a reputed killing and also another death and winds up focusing on the eccentric McLemore, a restorer of antique clocks, and his tortured relationship with the town of Woodstock. Several people in his life were also featured, including Goodson. “Because you know, I ain’t ever had no daddy worth a damn. He’s just about the only daddy I’ve got,” Goodson said of McLemore in the the third episode of the podcast. Woodstock, with a population of about 1,500 people, is located about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of the major city of Birmingham. “I know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included,” Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said in a statement Monday. “Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast. “Please remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many,” the mayor added. Julie Synder, the executive producer of “S-Town” declined to immediately comment when reached by email. Goodson in 2017 received a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to burglary and theft charges accusing him of taking items from McLemore's property after his death. Goodson, before pleading guilty, had maintained he was retrieving items that belonged to him. Goodson told The Associated Press in 2017 that the podcast had brought a deluge of attention on him and the town, but neither have done him any favors. “It’s a sad story, especially if you’re part of it,” Goodson said."

The suspect later identified as Francisco Javier Alba, 52, assaulted an employee inside the location and exited before walking across the street to the west sidewalk. Officers arrived at the location and spoke with the victim, who provided details of the incident, which described that a misdemeanor battery and vandalism occurred. The victim described Alba as the suspect but declined to make a private person’s arrest. Officers exited the business and returned to their police cruiser where they began to complete the associated crime reports, when Alba returned. He approached the officers while holding a drywall hammer with combined hatchet blade in his hand and appeared to be wearing numerous layers of clothing. Alba began arguing with the officers when they ordered him not to return to the business. The suspect walked across the street to the west sidewalk while becoming increasingly agitated. Officers requested an additional unit for a “415 man” and for approximately 30-35 minutes continued to order Alba to leave the area and drop the bladed hammer. Alba started crossing the street toward the officers with the hammer in his hand. Officers gave Alba numerous orders to stop, get out of the street and drop the hammer. He refused to comply with commands resulting in officers utilizing numerous less lethal munitions including a TASER, 40mm less-lethal-launchers and beanbag shotguns, which were ineffective. Alba continued to advance towards one officer, while still armed with the hammer in his hand stating, “Shoot it, shoot it,” at which point an Officer-Involved Shooting occurred. He was struck by gunfire, fell to the ground and was taken into custody without further incident. Personnel from the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the scene and transported Alba by rescue ambulance to Holy Cross Medical Center where he was admitted for gunshot wounds and listed in stable condition. A drywall hammer with combined hatchet blade was recovered from the scene and booked as evidence. No officers or other community members were injured as a result of this incident. The LAPD’s specialized Force Investigation Division responded to the scene, interviewed witnesses, and supervised the collection of evidence by the Forensic Science Division personnel. The complete investigation will be reviewed by the Chief of Police, the Board of Police Commissioners, and the Office of the Inspector General to determine the thoroughness and accuracy of the investigation and whether the use of deadly force complied with LAPD’s policies and procedures."

The announcement is a reversal for Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, a progressive who ran on promises to hold police accountable in the Texas capital. Garza, a Democrat, said his office would dismiss indictments against 17 officers but still move forward with prosecuting four others. He announced the decision in a statement made with Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat who was not in office at the time of the protests. “This has been a difficult chapter for Austin. I look forward to turning the page. These announcements will allow police officers, whose lives were upended by the indictments, to return to their services to our community,â Watson said. The slate of felony charges in Austin had been by far the most indictments of officers from a single U.S. police department over tactics law enforcement used during the 2020 protests. Two Dallas officers face charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and official oppression, and a New York police officer was charged with assault after shoving a woman to the ground. But despite widespread claims of heavy-handed or even illegal police tactics, few cities pursued charges. The City of Austin has paid out more than $18 million to settle lawsuits brought by protesters injured during the protests, including a college student who suffered brain damage after an officer shot him with a beanbag round. Eight other lawsuits are still pending, according to the city. During the protests, some Austin police officers fired beanbag rounds into the crowd. In a statement, Garza did not give specific reasons about why his office was dropping most of the cases while letting others proceed. He said his office âwould continue to hold law enforcement who break the law accountable.” Garza also said he expects the Justice Department to seriously consider their request to review Austin police’s actions during the protests. Ken Ervin, an attorney who represents nine of the officers who are having the charges dismissed, said the cases should have never been brought. He also represents several of the officers still facing charges. âWe predicted this (dismissal) some time ago. The cases were indicted before the investigations were complete,” Ervin said. “We didnât think the DAâs office was serious about prosecuting these cases. He just needed a reason to dismiss and save face.â Ervin said he welcomed the invitation for federal scrutiny on the officerâs actions during the protests. The indictments at the time widened the rift in Austin between police and Garza, whose 2020 campaign was backed by liberal allies including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and promised crackdowns on misconduct by law enforcement."

The incident happened back in March on the first floor of an office building in the area of Northeast 168th Street and Northeast 2nd Avenue. North Miami Beach Police Chief Harvette Smith said officers responded to the building around 1:30 p.m. after getting a 911 call of a man walking around with a large machete. When officers arrived at the scene and made contact with the man, he refused officers' commands and ran into the building after officers tased him, Smith said.

Bodycam footage released Monday showed the moment the man held a woman hostage with the machete pointed at her neck as she pleads for her life. ""She's not doing anything to you, please put her down,"" a police officer is heard saying. ""Let her go. It's okay, man. Put the machete down."" Local ""Just relax, man,"" the officer added. ""We're going to get this worked out and everything is going to be just fine."" After several attempts by officers ordering the man to drop the weapon, he continued to refuse to drop it and officers opened fire, Smith said. ""The machete was pointed at her neck, in an attempt to kill her. At that point, our officers again gave commands for the subject to drop the knife. The subject refused to drop the knife at that point, making my officers result to using deadly force to save a life,"" Smith said. The woman was recovered as officers tried to give life-saving measures to the suspect, Smith said. Further bodycam footage shows police checking the woman for injuries. The suspect died from his injuries. Family members later identified him as 38-year-old Edridge Alexis. No officers were injured and the woman was also okay, Smith said. ""He’s a good guy. They can’t tell me he had a machete and tried to cut people throat,"" said Wilkinson Alexis, the suspect's brother. ""Nah, he ain’t like that."" He said his brother struggled with his mental health, and he doesn't believe what police are saying about the incident is true. ""They’re lying. Just be real about (it)... say you killed someone,"" Wilkinson Alexis said. Smith said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting, which is standard practice. No other information has been released. Check back with NBC 6 for updates."

Shortly thereafter, police arrested the man on Sunday morning (local time) and killed him, investigators said. The 38-year-old is said to have committed the crimes in Queens and then set a sofa on fire. The police were said to have received a call from a teenage girl who was connected to the alleged perpetrator. She called for help and said her cousin was killing family members, the New York Daily News reported. When the police arrived, the man punched one of the investigators in the face and stabbed another between the neck and chest. Then a 28-year-old police officer shot him. Both investigators are in the hospital and their lives are not in danger. The crime occurred in the Far Rockaway area, south of John F. Kennedy Airport, about an hour’s drive from downtown Manhattan.

Goodson, 32, posted this on Facebook Sunday: “Police bout to shoot me down in my own yard.’’ Woodstock Mayor Jeff Dodson said officers were called to Goodson’s home. Dodson said multiple law enforcement agencies responded to Goodson’s home. He did not release the nature of the initial 911 call. They spent three hours trying to talk Goodson out of the house before he was shot. The State Bureau of Investigation is leading the probe. Dodson released this statement Monday morning: “Yesterday, I woke up to the news of a tragedy. I received requests from the media to comment and release this young man’s name within hours of his passing. “I don’t believe that I had the right to do that until 24 hours had passed in order to allow his family to be notified. “Now that this time has passed I am devastated to let you know that Tyler Goodson was the young man involved. Woodstock Police were dispatched to a 911 call, they requested backup upon arrival, and were assisted by multiple agencies. The Alabama State Bureau of Investigation is now in charge. “I know that everyone wants answers and details, myself included. Tyler was well known and loved by myself, his family and this community. That love extends far beyond due to the S-Town podcast. “Please remember at this time that he is so much more than a character to the fans who loved him. This young man was a father, son, brother and friend to many.” Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Sgt. Jeremy Burkett said shooting happened early Sunday near the 500 Block of Georgia Loop in Woodstock in Bibb County. Goodson, Burkett said, had barricaded himself in the residence and a stand-off ensued. During the course of the incident, Goodson brandished a gun at officers and Goodson was shot, Burkett said. Burkett said once the investigation is complete, the findings will be turned over to the Bibb County District Attorney’s Office. Goodson and the small Bibb County town of Woodstock were featured in the hit podcast “S-Town,” from the makers of “Serial” and “This American Life.” The podcast was downloaded 40 million times worldwide within a month of its March release. “S-Town” focused on a man who lived in Woodstock named John B. McLemore. Podcast host Brian Reed begins the podcast to investigate a murder, but the story changes when McLemore dies instead. McLemore and Goodson were close friends and were described in the podcast as having a father-son relationship. Goodson said in the podcast that McLemore promised him, in the event of his death, McLemore’s land and custody of his mother Mary Grace; however, McLemore did not leave a will and the estate went to his mother. Mary Grace was eventually placed in the care of McLemore’s cousin, and Goodson was warned by law enforcement not to go back onto the property without permission. However, Goodson said he went back to the property numerous times and took several items he claimed were his. In 2017, Goodson pleaded guilty to charges of third-degree burglary, third-degree theft of property and third-degree criminal trespassing in connection with McLemore’s land. Following his plea, Goodson received a suspended 10-year sentence with five years of probation."

The man was then seen holding a firearm, and he went back inside before later coming back outside. “He threatened to kill the deputies, and he pointed his weapon in the direction of the deputies,” Akin said in a press release. “Upon seeing the firearm pointed in the officers’ direction, deputies fired their weapons striking the man.” Officers administered first aid, and Wise County EMS, which had been staged nearby, also attended to the man, but they were unable to revive him. No officers were injured. The deceased man’s identity is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. The Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting. Read more here.

The incident began around 5:10 p.m. when the sheriff’s office received a call from a man requesting deputies be sent to his home on Single Tree Road southeast of Decatur, Wise County Sheriff Lane Akin said. Deputies have been called to the residence multiple times for domestic disturbance and assault reports, the sheriff added. “The caller refused to say why he wanted deputies to come to his house. He hung up, but called back and said, ‘Send the f***ing deputies,’” Akin said in a press release. When deputies arrived, they walked toward the front door, identified themselves as WCSO deputies and spoke to a man on his porch. After speaking to him briefly, the man reached toward his back waistband, and deputies backed away from the porch. The man was then seen holding a firearm in his right hand, and he went back inside the house before later coming back out to the porch. “He threatened to kill the deputies, and he pointed his weapon in the direction of the deputies,” Akin said in the press release. “Upon seeing the firearm pointed in the officers’ direction, deputies fired their weapons striking the man.” Officers administered first aid, and Wise County EMS — which had been staged nearby — also attended to the man, but they were unable to revive him. No officers were injured, Akin said. The deceased man’s identity is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. The Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting. This is the WCSO’s second officer-involved shooting in two months. On Oct. 9, deputies and a Boyd Police officer responded to a domestic disturbance call in the 100 block of Honeysuckle Road in Paradise and were met with gunfire from 37-year-old Edward Lander. Officers returned fire, fatally wounding Lander."

The announcement is a reversal for Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, a progressive who ran on promises to hold police accountable in the Texas capital. Garza, a Democrat, said his office would dismiss indictments against 17 officers but still move forward with prosecuting four others. He announced the decision in a statement made with Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat who was not in office at the time of the protests. “This has been a difficult chapter for Austin. I look forward to turning the page. These announcements will allow police officers, whose lives were upended by the indictments, to return to their services to our community,â Watson said. The slate of felony charges in Austin had been by far the most indictments of officers from a single U.S. police department over tactics law enforcement used during the 2020 protests. Two Dallas officers face charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and official oppression, and a New York police officer was charged with assault after shoving a woman to the ground. But despite widespread claims of heavy-handed or even illegal police tactics, few cities pursued charges. The City of Austin has paid out more than $18 million to settle lawsuits brought by protesters injured during the protests, including a college student who suffered brain damage after an officer shot him with a beanbag round. Eight other lawsuits are still pending, according to the city. During the protests, some Austin police officers fired beanbag rounds into the crowd. In a statement, Garza did not give specific reasons about why his office was dropping most of the cases while letting others proceed. He said his office âwould continue to hold law enforcement who break the law accountable.” Garza also said he expects the Justice Department to seriously consider their request to review Austin police’s actions during the protests. Ken Ervin, an attorney who represents nine of the officers who are having the charges dismissed, said the cases should have never been brought. He also represents several of the officers still facing charges. âWe predicted this (dismissal) some time ago. The cases were indicted before the investigations were complete,” Ervin said. “We didnât think the DAâs office was serious about prosecuting these cases. He just needed a reason to dismiss and save face.â Ervin said he welcomed the invitation for federal scrutiny on the officerâs actions during the protests. The indictments at the time widened the rift in Austin between police and Garza, whose 2020 campaign was backed by liberal allies including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and promised crackdowns on misconduct by law enforcement. Copyright © 2023 The Washington Times, LLC. Click to Read More and View Comments Click to Hide"

A lieutenant and three deputies from the Barrow County Sheriffâs Office responded to a 911 call reporting a domestic disturbance. The caller, identified as the wife of the deceased, reported a verbal argument that had escalated into violence. The wife told dispatch that her husband, later identified as Robert Reynolds, Sr., 60, had a firearm. Upon arriving at the scene, officers knocked on the door and identified themselves. Simultaneously, the garage door began to open, and the deputies found themselves face-to-face with Reynolds, who was seated in a chair, holding a firearm in his lap. Reynolds grabbed the gun and pointed it at the officers while yelling at them. In response, three deputies discharged their weapons, resulting in Reynolds sustaining fatal injuries. Immediate aid was administered, but Reynolds succumbed to his injuries after being transported to a local hospital. Barrow County Sheriffâs Office has placed the three deputies involved in the shooting on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of the investigation. A stress management team has also been deployed to assist the deputies in coping with the aftermath of the incident. The GBI is actively investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and the case will be forwarded to the Piedmont Judicial Circuit for review upon completion. An autopsy on Reynolds will be conducted at the GBI crime lab as part of the ongoing investigation. The incident marks the 96th officer-involved shooting that the GBI has been requested to investigate in 2023."

Indian River County Sheriff Eric Flowers held a news conference Monday afternoon to discuss the incident, which occurred July 14. Region Indian River County Indian River County Sheriff's Office deputy shot himself after gun not fixed The sheriff said Deputy Zachary Seldes was coming in for a training class and took off his vest. As he did, Flowers said the deputy's Sig P320 discharged inside of the holster, striking Seldes in the calf. The bullet traveled down the deputy's leg and became lodged just before his ankle. Other deputies at the scene began rendering aid and took him to the hospital, which eventually required ""a couple of surgeries,"" the sheriff said. Flowers said a similar incident occurred shortly afterward in Connecticut, and he became aware that other law enforcement agencies had stopped using the weapon because of similar fears, including Pasco County, Florida. ""From Connecticut, you'll see in the video, the officer is inside the police department. He leans forward. The gun goes off in the holster,"" Flowers said. ""There's no hands anywhere near it. There's nobody touching it. That's a grave concern to me."" After the unintended discharge of the firearm, the sheriff said they looked at multiple vendors to replace the use of the SIG Sauer P320. Flowers said they settled on using the FN 509, which is also used by the Los Angeles Police Department. All deputies who serve the Indian River County Sheriff's Office are now carrying the firearm, and Flowers said they are ""very happy"" using the new gun. ""We hope that being here today that other law enforcement leaders will think about this,"" Flowers said. ""I've gone to the Florida Sheriff's Association. I've told my fellow sheriffs if you're carrying this Sig weapon, it's a huge liability for your agency."" The sheriff said the injured deputy is doing well, and they believe he will be back on patrol in the early part of 2024. The cost to transition to the new model of weapon was $136,000 for 370 guns and holsters, Flowers said. Seldes did not speak at Monday's news conference because he is filing a lawsuit against SIG Sauer. According to a separate lawsuit facing the company, a prominent online gun shop pulled the P320 from shelves after 20 other similar injuries. WPTV has contacted SIG Sauer for comment but has not heard back."

The man who died was identified as 60-year-old Lamont Bland. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department provided the update from the woman on Monday. Officers were sent to a âcall for helpâ involving a hostage situation about 7:20 p.m. Thursday at McDonaldâs at 4941 Knights Way. That’s in an area with restaurants, hotels, and truck stops southwest of the I-69 and I-465 interchange. The 911 caller directed police to the semitrailer involved. Officers tried to speak with the truck driver, Bland, who briefly sat in the front seat before returning to the sleeping compartment of the truck that was covered by a curtain. After trying to speak with Bland, that’s when police say they heard the woman screaming from the back of the truck. Police set up a perimeter around the semitruck and made announcements. Eventually, police broke out the driver’s side window to better see and hear into the truck, as well as move the curtains blocking the view into the cab. IMPD says an officer tried to communicate with Bland and gain rapport, but Bland started making threats to kill the woman with a knife. The woman could be heard screaming for help during the encounter. Eventually, the officer made it into the truck, and found Bland on top of the woman. He fired his gun, fatally shooting Bland. After further investigation, detectives learned from the woman she had allegedly been pulled into the cabin of the semitrailer and held there against her will for hours. Police say she also told officers that the suspect, 60-year-old Lamont Bland, claimed she stole something from him. The woman said she had never met Bland before the shooting. IMPD says no officers were hurt. Medics treated the woman at the scene before she was taken to the downtown IMPD homicide office to be interviewed. As is standard procedure, investigators will look into what happened and the police procedures used. The lieutenant will be placed on administrative leave. IMPD says other officers on the scene also may receive time off to process what happened. This police shooting was the 17th in 2023. Itâs the most police shootings since 20 were recorded in 2015. Police generally release the names of officers in the shootings about a week after they happen. Bodycam footage is usually shared a few weeks later."

The case could have broader consequences for bystanders injured in police shootings. Kodi Gaines was 5 years old when county police officers came to the door of his mother’s Randallstown apartment in 2016 to serve arrest warrants for her and her fiancé. After a standoff, Kodi was injured in the shooting that killed his mother and had to undergo multiple surgeries, according to court filings. The hourslong standoff turned fatal when Cpl. Royce Ruby fired through a wall at Korryn Gaines, an action a Baltimore County jury found was unreasonable in 2018 though she was armed with a shotgun and had pointed it at officers. The jury awarded $38 million in damages, with about $32 million allocated to Kodi. Since then, the litigation has dragged on for nearly six years, leading to two different opinions in the Appellate Court of Maryland. In August, Maryland’s highest court agreed to take up two legal questions arising from the state appeals court’s most recent opinion in April. Circuit Court Judge Mickey Norman, a former state trooper, threw out the jury’s verdict in 2019, a decision later overturned by the state appeals court. Norman then ordered Baltimore County to pay Kodi a lower amount: $400,000 plus interest of $160,000. County officials settled with Gaines’ estate, daughter and parents for $3 million in 2021. The jury had originally awarded those family members a total of $5.4 million. One question for the Supreme Court of Maryland relates to whether Kodi Gaines lost the ability to raise an issue in a second appeal. The other has to do with the doctrine of qualified immunity, a legal concept that protects government officials from liability while performing their duties unless they were violating a constitutional right that was “clearly established” law at the time. “The qualified immunity doctrine basically says that you, the government, you don’t get penalized … for violating any sort of rule or law or constitutional command that was not at the time that you committed the violation pretty clearly explained,” said Gregory Dolin, a law professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The doctrine says a government official is immune unless the law was “absolutely clear that what you did was not permissible,” Dolin said. Usually the issue of whether qualified immunity applies is resolved early in a case, but the issue was left up to the jury. The Appellate Court of Maryland found that Kodi’s lawyers failed to show there was clearly established law putting Ruby on notice that he would violate the 14th Amendment when unintentionally shooting and injuring an innocent bystander. Qualified immunity has critics from across the ideological spectrum, including Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor. A 2020 federal policing reform bill, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, would have restricted its use as a defense for police officers had it passed the U.S. Senate. Kodi Gaines’ attorneys argued in court filings that his “substantive due process rights” against being injured by agents of the state were violated when Ruby shot him, and that the appellate court’s ruling would expand the definition of qualified immunity beyond what federal courts had established. The appellate court’s ruling would “effectively immunize law enforcement officers who shoot innocent bystanders,” his attorneys wrote. “It is also contrary to the fundamental right to substantive due process and would lead to the perverse result that the target of the officer’s abusive conduct may have a constitutional claim, but innocent bystanders would not.” “We look forward to a full and fair hearing on the issues,” attorney Leslie D. Hershfield said Thursday. On that day in 2016, a few hours into the standoff, Korryn Gaines followed Kodi into the kitchen to make him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, according to testimony from the jury trial. Ruby testified that he shot through the kitchen wall, aiming to hit Gaines in the head. Instead, he hit her in the back with a shot that then lodged in Kodi’s face, according to an appellate court opinion. As Ruby fired additional shots at Korryn Gaines, another hit Kodi and injured him further. Ruby retired from the police department in June 2021, according to a police spokesperson. The Baltimore County State’s Attorney’s Office did not charge him or other officers in 2016 and found the shooting justified. Baltimore County argued in an October filing that qualified immunity should apply to Ruby in this case in part because Kodi was effectively a hostage, writing that other federal cases would suggest that accidentally shooting a hostage does not violate that person’s substantive due process rights. The county also argued that Ruby did not violate Kodi’s rights because he did not intend to hurt Kodi when he fired. County Attorney James Benjamin did not return a call seeking comment. A county spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation. In an amicus brief filed by the ACLU of Maryland, the Public Justice Center and the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, attorneys argued that while the Maryland court must respect U.S. Supreme Court precedent with regard to qualified immunity, it should not expand the doctrine further. “This case shows why qualified immunity must not be a rubber stamp for reckless police action,” the organizations wrote. “Police should not be allowed to evade liability when they engage in misconduct merely because that misconduct happens to harm an innocent third party. That is particularly true in this case, where the victim was a five-year-old child.” The U.S. Supreme Court created the concept of qualified immunity in 1967, envisioned as “good faith immunity” when police were charged with federal civil rights violations, said Deborah Jeon, legal director for the ACLU of Maryland. “At the time, the court was concerned that when police officers make mistakes — and they’re going to make mistakes — that they’re going to be personally liable. And that’s actually so far from the way things work today,” Jeon said. “Police officers are not personally liable in these cases.” She said this case will be the first time the Supreme Court of Maryland will rule on qualified immunity as it relates to federal constitutional claims. The court previously held that there is no state counterpart to qualified immunity for violations of Maryland’s constitution. Some states, including Colorado, Connecticut and New Mexico, have taken steps to limit qualified immunity for police officers. Dolin, who also serves as senior litigation counsel for the New Civil Liberties Alliance, said that the broader doctrine of qualified immunity does not just apply to law enforcement, but to the actions of any government employee. “People should care because government officials violate our rights all the time,” Dolin said. “The question is who ought to pay for those violations.” Korryn Gaines’ shooting sparked conversations about how Baltimore County officers handled race and mental health issues in policing. Gaines was Black and, according to an appellate court opinion, police knew she had a history of mental illness. Her arrest warrant was for failing to appear in court for a traffic case. When local law enforcement agencies arrested David Linthicum in March after he allegedly shot two Baltimore County officers, the former attorney for some of Gaines’ relatives, J. Wyndal Gordon, questioned the different police responses. Linthicum, who is white, was not seriously injured during his arrest in Harford County.

Courtney Gordon, 38, is accused of attacking seven people in Far Rockaway on Sunday morning. Four relatives died, including two children, and a 61-year-old woman remains in critical condition. The suspect also slashed two responding officers who were later released from the hospital Sunday night. Gordon's family members in the Bronx say they tried to get him help a few months ago but he refused. They tried to get him checked into a hospital, but they say he wouldn't go. His aunt feared for her own safety and said she started locking the doors upstairs while he was staying in a room downstairs -- but recently she even stopped letting him stay there. That is why for the past month or so he was staying with his family in Far Rockaway. Family members say he was driving for a ride share service but his car had broken down, so he was out of work, and that he was on medication but he stopped taking it. The suspect's aunt in the Bronx says they recently got into an argument because he thought the security cameras in the home were watching him. Relatives also said he started listening to more ""evil"" music about killing. They say he refused their efforts for help. His life they say, and his mental health, began to unravel a few months ago. And then this weekend he allegedly snapped and killed four of his relatives. When officers arrived on the scene, Gordon was leaving the driveway with luggage. He reportedly slashed both police officers with a kitchen knife before one of the officers shot and killed him. Police found an 11-year-old girl lying on the ground outside the home. Gordon also allegedly set fire to a couch in the living room. After firefighters put that out, officers found three others dead inside, including a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, and a 30-year-old man. His cousin says he knew him all his life, but never imagined he would do this -- but also says he saw the signs. ""He was he like, he's just very defensive towards everybody and verbally, you can see that the clues of what he was, what he did, you just seeing it, like he would yell very loud, top of his voice, so it like kind of would bring everybody into this, like, kind of let me not talk to him because I don't know if he's going to know what he's about,"" the suspect's cousin Sean McCoy said. Gordon has a prior arrest for strangulation in a domestic incident. The victims haven't been identified yet, but the 61-year-old fighting to stay alive is his aunt, who was trying to take him in. The state attorney general will investigate Gordon's death. (Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly said the suspect's mother feared for her safety, not his aunt.)

José Garza Dismisses Charges Against 17 Officers Indicted for 2020 Protest Response,N,"D.A. José Garza Dismisses Charges Against 17 Officers Indicted for 2020 Protest Response D.A., City ask feds to investigate Austin Police Department By Austin Sanders, 4:34PM, Mon. Dec. 4, 2023 Travis County District Attorney José Garza announced today, Dec. 4, that his office would dismiss charges against 17 of the 21 Austin police officers indicted for felony assault for their actions during 2020 protests that followed the police killings of George Floyd and Michael Ramos. In all 21 cases, grand juries determined there was enough evidence to support charges for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, allegedly committed when officers shot into large crowds of protesters with “lead pellet” rounds and caused serious injuries. Prior to Dec. 4, the D.A.’s office had dropped two of those cases. Meanwhile, lawsuits related to certain shootings have already played out in civil courts. As a result, the City of Austin has paid nearly $20 million in damages to victims. Now, only four cases remain to be criminally prosecuted, and the identities of those four officers still facing charges have not yet been disclosed. Garza also announced that his office would issue a joint request with the City of Austin to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division asking that the DOJ open a “pattern-and-practice” investigation into the Austin Police Department’s response to the protests in 2020. Such reviews are meant to determine whether a police department’s procedures have resulted in a widespread violation of constitutional rights and can lead to federally-mandated policy changes within the department outlined in a consent decree. If the DOJ takes on the investigation, it won’t be the first time. In 2004, the local NAACP chapter and the Texas Civil Rights Project requested a pattern-and-practice review, which the DOJ started in 2007. In 2011, the DOJ closed the case with a finding that APD did not regularly violate the constitutional rights of Austin residents. “We expect the Department of Justice will take our request seriously,” Garza said in a news release announcing the dropped charges and joint request. “We look forward to working with Mayor [Kirk] Watson, Interim APD Chief Robin Henderson, and City Council to ensure full cooperation with the DOJ investigation.” The DOJ does not have to accept the request for review and it is unclear when the federal agency will make a decision. In a news release, Austin’s Interim City Manager Jesús Garza pointed to several reforms APD has made since the 2020 shootings, including discontinuing use of the “lead pellet” rounds, which were fired from shotguns, as a crowd control measure.

According to a prepared statement by the Idaho State Police Department, the situation began to unfold Monday about 1 a.m. when “an Idaho State Police trooper initiated a vehicle stop for a traffic violation near the Candlewood Suites Hotel, located at 665 Pancheri Drive. During the stop, the trooper requested additional units assist,” the ISP statement said. “As Idaho Falls Police Department (IFPD) officers arrived in the area, the trooper advised a male passenger fired at them and ran from the vehicle.” The trooper and arriving IFPD officers chased the man on foot, the ISP statement said. “At this time, it is believed that the ISP trooper and two officers exchanged gunfire with the man during the incident, which concluded in the area of the car dealership on the corner of Pancheri Drive and Yellowstone Highway.

Jean-Francois Ricard said in a news conference that suspect Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab could face a preliminary charge of murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise. He said Rajabpour-Miyandoab is a French national who is being held in police custody. Rajabpour-Miyandoab recorded a video before the attack in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State group and expressed support for Islamic extremists operating in various areas, including in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Egypt’s Sinai, Yemen, Iran and Pakistan, Ricard said. The video, in Arabic, was published on Rajabpour-Miyandoa’s account on X, formerly Twitter, where his recent posts included references to the Israel-Hamas war, the prosecutor said. It wasn’t immediately clear if Rajabpour-Miyandoab had legal representation. A message left Sunday with the prosecutor’s office seeking to locate him for comment was not immediately returned. Ricard said Rajabpour-Miyandoab was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris, in a family with no religious affiliation. He converted to Islam at the age of 18 and quickly adhered to Islamic extremist ideology, he said. In 2016, he had planned to join the Islamic State group in Syria. The same year, he was convicted and imprisoned for four years, until 2020, on a charge of planning violence. He was under psychiatric treatment and was on a special list for feared radicals, the prosecutor confirmed. Since the end earlier this year of a probation period during which he received mandatory psychiatric care, Rajabpour-Miyandoab was placed under the surveillance of intelligence services, Ricard said. His mother had in October expressed “concerns” over her son isolating himself, but no evidence was found that could have led to criminal proceedings, he added. Three other people from Rajabpour-Miyandoab’s entourage and family have been detained by police for questioning, Ricard said. The apparently random attack near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the river in an unprecedented scenic start in the heart of Paris. In a sign of that concern, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a meeting for Sunday evening with key ministers and officials charged with security for a “total review” of measures in place and the handling of the “most dangerous individuals,” her office said. After killing the tourist, the attacker crossed the bridge to the city’s Right Bank and injured two people, a British and a French national, with a hammer, authorities said. Ricard said both of them were able to get back home on Sunday. Video circulating on the internet showed police officers, weapons drawn, cornering a man dressed in black, his face covered and what appeared to be a knife in his right hand. The suspect cried “Allahu Akbar” (God is great) and a police officer twice tasered the suspect before arresting him, authorities said. Questioned by police, the suspect expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, Darmanin said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on X that the news from Paris was “shocking.” “My thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German man,” she wrote. “Almost his entire life was before him. … Hate and terror have no place in Europe.” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, in a post on X, expressed condolences for the victim’s family and friends and hope that Europe stands together against terrorism. “A heartfelt thought to the family members and loved ones of the victim,” she wrote. “May Europe stay united against every form of terrorism.” The French media widely reported that the man, who lived with his parents in the Essonne region, outside Paris, was of Iranian origin. “This person was ready to kill others,” Darmanin told reporters, who along with other government members and President Emmanuel Macron praised police officers for their response. Well-known emergency physician Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV there was a large quantity of blood. Pelloux said he was told by the victim’s entourage that the suspect stopped them to ask for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the victim. “He aimed at the head, then the back. He knew where to strike,” Pelloux said. Ricard, the prosecutor, said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with one of the two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray. He said the suspect was also in touch with the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia’s Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The Saturday attack brought into sharp focus authorities’ concern for potential terrorist violence during the 2024 Games. Just days earlier, the Paris police chief had unveiled detailed plans for the Olympic Games’ security in Paris, with zones where traffic will be restricted and people will be searched. The police chief, Laurent Nunez, said one of their concerns is that vehicles could be used as battering rams to plow through Olympic crowds. Speaking Sunday evening on TF1 television about security concerns during the Olympics, Darmanin said this year’s Rugby World Cup “took place in good conditions. So did the Pope’s visit to Marseille, and so did the King and Queen of England (visit to France).” He added that police plans prior to the attack include a security perimeter with checkpoints around the Eiffel Tower. ___ By ELAINE GANLEY and SYLVIE CORBET Associated Press Associated Press writers John Leicester in Paris and Frances D’Emilio in Rome contributed to this report."

Lawyers representing the parents of Jack Murray said at a news conference that they are launching an investigation into the shooting, which police say occurred when the 24-year-old confronted officers outside his home with a knife. Family attorney Antonio Romanucci said his clients believe the Elk Grove Village Police Department was familiar with Murray and knew he occasionally called them for help when he was dealing with physical or emotional distress. ""That Friday afternoon, on Dec. 1, Jack was in distress,"" Romanucci said during the news conference attended by Murray's parents and siblings. ""He felt he was mentally and physically not right."" Romanucci said his law firm's investigation will focus on the officers' treatment of a known emotionally distressed person and their use of de-escalation tactics. He also called for ""immediate transparency"" from police, through the release of 9-1-1 call recordings and all relevant police body camera and dashboard camera footage. ""His family is deeply grieving and deserves answers on exactly what happened that Friday afternoon,"" Romanucci said. ""We simply will not accept the police narrative or their version of the events that happened. We want truth and we want transparency."" Police have said officers responded to the 200 block of Fern Drive at about 4:30 p.m. Friday after a 9-1-1 calling regarding a man with a knife. Murray was shot after he confronted officers with a knife in a nearby yard, according to the police account. He was taken by ambulance to Ascension Alexian Brothers Medical Center, where he later was pronounced dead, authorities said. Romanucci said Monday that Murray's family was told at the hospital that he was ""a crime scene"" and as a result they were prevented from seeing him. ""For as long as I've been doing this, I have never encountered a family being denied (the ability) to say goodbye,"" he said. In a statement Monday, Elk Grove Village and the police department offered condolences to the Murray family for what they described as ""Friday's tragic incident."" An independent investigation into the deadly shooting is being conducted by the Major Case Assistance Team, officials said. ""The Elk Grove Village Police Department has already provided MCAT investigators footage of the body-worn cameras, and vehicle camera footage is available for their review,"" the statement reads. ""Additionally, the Elk Grove Village Police Department has been conducting a parallel criminal investigation in order gain a complete understanding of the events that led to the incident."" As required by department police, five officers who responded Dec. 1 are on temporary administrative leave as the investigation continues, officials said. Not all were involved with the use of lethal force, according to the statement. ""We plan to share additional information about this incident publicly, including the audio from 9-1-1 dispatch, as well as the audio and video footage from the officers' body-worn and vehicle cameras,"" the statement adds. ""We know that sharing this information in a transparent way will help our community better understand the events that unfolded last Friday afternoon. It is our goal to share this information as soon as we are can, after crucial investigative steps have been taken."" Murray's aunt, Liz Belcaster, said at Monday's news conference that the family still has many unanswered questions about what transpired Friday afternoon. ""Jack was only 24 years old. He was just starting his life. He was challenged by his health issues, being a Type I diabetic,"" she said. ""It impacted him physically and was also a significant emotional challenge. There were times when he needed help quickly and believed police could help him, as they had in the past. We don't know what took place on Friday afternoon. But we know our family deserves answers."" Romanucci said there also needs to be more information about the knife, including its size and whether Murray pointed it at officers. ""Was there any attempt at de-escalation, other than saying 'drop the knife,' knowing that he had these mental and emotional issues?"" Romanucci asked. ""Was this a cry for help, as opposed to him being a dangerous person on the street who was potentially harmful to others? Did he really present a threat of bodily harm or injury or death to anybody at all, maybe even including himself? So, that's what we're looking for right now."""

Bronx resident Lillian McKoy said her nephew Courtney Gordon â the 38-year-old police named as the suspect in the grisly domestic slaying at 467 Beach 22nd St. â exhibited alarming behavior earlier this year, leading his mother and sister to reach out to mental health professionals to take him into treatment. âBut he, in turn, reversed it and began to tell them they're the ones that need help, he is fine,â McKoy said in the living room of her Eastchester apartment. âHe refused to go.â Officers responding to a 911 call around 5 a.m. Sunday found Gordon exiting the Far Rockaway home with luggage, and when they approached him, he stabbed two of them with a knife, according to the NYPD. One of the officers then shot Gordon, who later died from his injuries, police said. The victims had not been identified as of early Monday afternoon. They included an 11-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman and a man in his 30s â all deceased â as well as a 61-year-old woman with multiple stab wounds who remained in critical condition at a hospital, according to an NYPD spokesperson. The injured officers were transported to a hospital and were expected to recover, the police union said Sunday. McKoy said Gordon had stayed at her apartment for a few months this past year and she sometimes feared for her safety around her nephew, who became easily enraged. âI just did not like his demeanor, the way he looked at me and the attitude,â she added. âIf someone resents you that much, you don't know what will happen.â She said she had opened her home to Gordon because her sister â Gordonâs mother â was already living there. According to McKoy, he had been living elsewhere with his wife and young son, but his marriage unraveled within the past few years and he was struggling to find housing. McKoy said she eventually noticed concerning behavior from her nephew: He would walk off his job during the workday, was prone to snapping at family members and liked to listen to music about guns and killing. âIt was not the same person I knew when he just [came] from Jamaica,â she said, recalling how Gordon seemed normal and âjollyâ when he first arrived in New York about 15 years ago. About five years ago, Gordon got married, had a child, and was working at a BJâs store, said McCoy. She said he would regularly visit his mom, along with his son, and attend cookouts and other family events. Police said Gordon was previously arrested in the Bronx for domestic violence strangulation, but the District Attorneyâs office could not comment on the case as it was sealed in 2021. Gothamist was not immediately able to reach Gordonâs ex-wife Monday. McKoy said she asked Gordon to move out of her apartment after he demanded she remove security cameras she had installed around her home. He then bounced around, living at homeless shelters before his aunt on his fatherâs side, Christine Watson, offered to take him in at her home in Far Rockaway, per McKoy. Gordon was at Watsonâs home for about two weeks before police received a chilling 911 call Sunday morning from a child who said her cousin âwas killing her family.â McKoy said she found out about the killings when her niece â Gordonâs sister â called her frantically. âI was just devastated,â McKoy said, noting the incident hit home because her nephew had just been living with her weeks earlier. âHe was living here â¦ and then he went there, and they were helping him, and this is what happened.â Sean McKoy, Lillianâs son, said he would try to reason with Gordon â to little avail â during the months they lived together in Eastchester, but never thought his cousin would be the suspect in a multiple homicide. âI've known him for so long that I wouldn't think that he would resort to that kind of violence,â he said, adding that he was shaken by the killings. His mother Lillian, who works with adults with mental disabilities, cautioned families to try to help loved ones who show signs of drastic behavioral changes. âDo it, because you never know what tomorrow's [going to] hold for you,â she said. âCountless families [are] in mourning, being destroyed, because their loved one did not get the help they need.â Andrew Giambrone contributed reporting."

(WANE) — The Indiana State Police investigator conducting an investigation into an officer-involved shooting in Fort Wayne submitted their findings to the Allen County Prosecutor, an ISP spokesman told WANE 15. The prosecutor’s office confirmed it received the completed investigation on Monday. The shooting happened on November 19 near Winchester Road and Babcock Lane. It claimed the life of 20-year-old Dachena Warren-Hill and resulted in Officer Mark Guzman taking five days of mandated administrative leave. Fort Wayne police told WANE 15 Guzman has since returned to work as a patrol officer. FWPD added that its internal investigation being completed by its Administrative Shooting Team isn’t finished yet. Once it is, those findings will be submitted to Chief Steve Reed, an FWPD spokesman said. According to Fort Wayne police, Guzman shot at Warren-Hill when he believed she was trying to hit him with her car. Guzman was an officer at the scene where 911 callers indicated a gold car had hit someone and was “banging into buildings.” A WANE 15 request to the City of Fort Wayne for the body-camera footage of the incident was denied. The video was cited as an investigatory record. The chief of staff for the Allen County Prosecutor’s office anticipates a news release regarding the shooting being sent out once all of the information has been received and reviewed."

CHARLES COUNTY â O'Fallon police on Sunday shot and killed a man they say fired shots at a clock tower outside the O'Fallon, Missouri, City Hall, led officers on a chase, then pointed a shotgun at them and exchanged gunfire.Â Douglas Alan Phipps, 34, was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting in the Royal Oaks subdivision of St. Charles County. The neighborhood is about 3 miles north of city hall.Â Phipps pointed a shotgun at officers after stepping out of his vehicle after stopping at a cul-de-sac on Spring Court, O'Fallon Sgt. Bryan Harr said in a news release. Officers then shot at Phipps, who returned fire before he was killed by officers.Â Harr said the two officers are a 47-year-old officer with 24 years of experience and a 28-year-old officer with five years of experience. Neither officer was injured.Â People are also reading… The incident began at about 4:15 p.m. Sunday when police received reports that someone was firing shots at the clock tower near City Hall on North Main Street, Harr said. The suspect was described as a white man driving a maroon car.Â Police tried to stop the car at the intersection of Main Street and Highway P, about a mile north of City Hall. The vehicle did not stop, and police pursued it west down Highway P and into the Royal Oaks subdivision.Â Surveillance video from a homeowner captured the pursuit when it turned off Highway P and into the subdivision. In the video, sirens can be heard before a red sedan enters the subdivision at a slow speed, followed closely by four police vehicles with lights and sirens activated.Â Ten more O'Fallon and St. Charles County police vehicles drove into the subdivision as the suspect led police on a slow drive looping through the neighborhood, said Keith Barker, who took the video from his home near Royal Oaks and Fawn Ridge drives. The video was taken at about 4:26 p.m., but a time stamp on the video is an hour ahead, Barker said.Â Police placed spike strips at Highway P and Royal Oaks, one of the entrances to the neighborhood, but Phipps instead turned the opposite direction on Royal Oaks and accelerated farther into the neighborhood and out of sight, Barker said. Barker, who has lived in the neighborhood for 24 years, said he didn't recognize Phipps. He often hears sirens on Highway P, but they're usually ambulances or firetrucks, he said. ""To hear sirens and then see this unusually slow pursuit was very unusual,"" Barker said. ""It was nothing like you would see on TV. ""This is going to be talked about in our subdivision for quite a long time."" The clock tower had visible damage on Monday.Â Sunday's shooting was the thirdÂ fatal police shooting in O'Fallon since January 2019, when an officer shot and killed an armed 64-year-old man during a mental health checkÂ at the man's home. OâFallon police said at the time that the officer feared for his and a mental health worker's life. The man's family sued the police department in August of this year claiming wrongful death. And in January 2022, police officers shot and killed a teen in a car on a cul-de-sac while responding to a call for a ""suspicious vehicle."" Police said they loudly knocked on the car window and spotted a handgun in the front seat before the driver reversed the car into a police vehicle and tried to drive off. The teen's family said he and a friend were sleeping in the car after visiting another friend in the area. The St. Charles County Prosecutor's office later declined to press charges against the officers, releasing video of the incident and saying the officers believed their lives were at risk.Â The incident Sunday is being investigated by the county'sÂ Critical Incident Response team, a group formed in 2022 that includes lieutenant commanders and detectives from the St. Charles County, Cottleville, Lake St. Louis, OâFallon, St. Charles, St. Peters and Wentzville police departments. The investigators eventually turn over their findings to the St. Charles County prosecutor. Phipps' family could not be reached Monday. O'Fallon police released a mugshot of Phipps but did not provide information about whether he was previously known to the department. Court records show Phipps had a lengthy criminal history in St. Charles, Lincoln and Warren counties including domestic assault, burglary, theft, trespassing and driving while intoxicated. Phipps also had several restraining orders filed against him, including two in 2022.Â The shooting in O'Fallon happened hours before a man wasÂ killed by a police officer in Lake St. LouisÂ after a struggle over a gun. In that case, police said they were investigating a report of a shooting when a man walked toward them with two handguns and fought with police when they tried to disarm him.Â Kim Bell of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.Â"

He is identified as 34-year-old Douglas Alan Phipps. Phipps is accused of firing shots at the clock tower just feet from O’Fallon City Hall Sunday afternoon. There is damage to three of the four sides of the clock. A resident who lives near City Hall told FOX 2 that they heard the gunshots. Police said that they don’t know why the individual was firing shots at the clock tower. Police were able to get a description of the vehicle that authorities shared that the suspect was driving. O’Fallon officers tried to pull over the vehicle, but the driver failed to stop and a pursuit started. It ended near Spring Court in unincorporated St. Charles County. Police say Phipps was armed with a shotgun and pointed it at officers. He was shot and killed during a shootout with the police. No officers were injured in the shooting. The officers involved in the shooting are 47 years old and 28 years old. The St. Charles County Critical Incident Response Team is investigating the incident. A motive for the shooting, police chase, and shootout have not yet been revealed."

(AP) â A man who appeared in the hit podcast âS-Town” died after being shot by police during a weekend standoff. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Monday that 32-year-old Joseph Tyler Goodson was pronounced dead after the standoff in the community of Woodstock, Alabama, that was featured in the podcast. It said Goodson brandished a handgun at officers after barricading himself early Sunday. No details were given as to what prompted the standoff.

Antonio Romanucci, attorney for the family of Jack Murray, said at a news conference in River North that his firm was conducting a civil investigation into the Friday shooting, focusing on “officers’ treatment of a known emotionally distressed person and their use of deescalation tactics.” According to Romanucci, Murray, 24, was a Type 1 diabetic whose behavior could become “erratic” depending on his insulin levels. He called 911 for help whenever he felt like his health, mental or physical, was “not right.” “In the past he had called Elk Grove Village police asking for help if he felt his own health and wellness were ever in danger,” said Romanucci, who was joined by Murray’s parents and siblings. Romanucci added that they have “very good information” that Murray was the one who called 911 for help on Friday before he was confronted by police. “We believe the Elk Grove Village Police Department was familiar with Jack Murray and knew he occasionally called them for help when he was in physical or emotional distress,” Romanucci said. He called for the police department to be transparent and release 911 calls, body camera footage and records of all known prior encounters officers had with Murray. The family refuses to accept at face value the police department’s claim that Murray was armed with a knife when he was shot, Romanucci said. “His family is deeply grieving and deserves answers on exactly what happened that Friday afternoon,” he said. Murray was shot by officers about 4 p.m. after he left home in the 200 block of Fern Drive while holding a knife and then confronted the officers in a nearby yard, police said in a statement. Murray was taken to Alexian Brothers Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, police and the Cook County medical examiner’s office said. An autopsy found he died of multiple gunshot wounds and ruled his death a homicide. Romanucci said the family was not allowed by police to see Murray’s body in the hospital. He described that as “morally reprehensible.” Five officers, not all of whom fired their weapons in the incident, have been placed on temporary administrative leave per department policy, Elk Grove Village police said. The department has shared pertinent video with the Major Case Assistance Team, which is conducting an independent investigation of the incident, police said. Elk Grove Village police are also conducting “a parallel criminal investigation in order to gain a complete understanding of the events that led to the incident.” The department said it planned on releasing 911 recordings and body camera footage as soon as “crucial investigative steps” have been taken. The department did not respond to questions about its history with Murray or whether he had called 911 before. Liz Belcaster, Murray’s aunt, says the family just wants answers so they can have closure. “Jack was only 24 years old; he was just starting his life.” Belcaster said, speaking on behalf of the family. “We don't know what took place on Friday afternoon, but we know our family deserves answers.”"

The random attack near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the river in an unprecedented scenic start in the heart of Paris. In a sign of that concern, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a meeting for Sunday evening with key ministers and officials charged with security for a âtotal reviewâ of measures in place and the handling of the âmost dangerous individuals,â her office said. After killing the tourist, the attacker crossed the bridge to the cityâs Right Bank and wounded two people with a hammer, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Saturday night. The suspect, who apparently cried âAllahu Akbarâ (God is great), was then arrested. Video circulating on the internet showed police officers, weapons drawn, cornering a man dressed in black, his face covered and what appeared to be a knife in his right hand. They twice tasered the suspect before arresting him, Darmanin said. Questioned by police, the suspect expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, Darmanin said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on X, formerly Twitter, that the news from Paris was âshocking.â âMy thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German man,â she wrote. âAlmost his entire life was before him. … Hate and terror have no place in Europe.â Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, in a post on X, expressed condolences for the victim’s family and friends and hope that Europe stands together against terrorism. âA heartfelt thought to the family members and loved ones of the victim,” she wrote. âMay Europe stay united against every form of terrorism.” The French interior minister said the suspect was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris. He had been convicted and jailed for four years, until 2020, for planning violence, was under psychiatric treatment, tracked for suspected Islamic radicalization and was on a special list for feared radicals. The French media widely reported that the man, who lived with his parents in the Essonne region, outside Paris, was of Iranian origin. The case was turned over to the anti-terrorism prosecutorâs office. âThis person was ready to kill others,â Darmanin told reporters, who along with other government members and President Emmanuel Macron praised police officers for their response. Well-known emergency doctor Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV there was blood everywhere. Pelloux said he was told by the victim’s entourage that the suspect stopped them to ask for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the victim. âHe aimed at the head, then the back. He knew where to strike,â Pelloux said. The daily Le Parisien, in an in-depth report published Sunday, said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray and the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russiaâs Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The attack brought into sharp focus authorities’ concern for potential terrorist violence during the 2024 Games. Just days earlier, the Paris police chief had unveiled detailed plans for the Olympic Games’ security in Paris, with zones where traffic will be restricted and people will be searched. The police chief, Laurent Nunez, said one of their concerns is that vehicles could be used as battering rams to plow through Olympic crowds. ___ John Leicester in Paris and Frances D’Emilio in Rome contributed to this report."

The video was on an X (formerly Twitter) account opened in mid-October, where he also posted about Hamas and Palestine. According to the prosecutor, in the video Rajabpour-Miyandoab “spoke in Arabic and presented himself as a fighter for the Islamic State (…) of a branch operating from Afghanistan… he also gave his support to the jihadists operating in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and Yemen”. During the press conference, Ricard explained that the young man, who is also suspected of injuring two other people with a hammer in Saturday’s attack, had converted to Islam in 2015 when he was 18. The suspect’s mother, an Iranian political exile, had been concerned about her son’s behaviour since mid-October. She said he had become “increasingly self-isolated”. The prosecutor confirmed that the 26-year-old suspect, who was born in the wealthy Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, had also been in contact in the past via social media with the killer of Professor Samuel Paty, Chechen Abdoullakh Anzorov, 18, who was killed by police after beheading the teacher in 2020. Rajabpour-Miyandoab had already served four years in prison for a planned attack in the La Défense business district (west of Paris) in 2016, and was under “medical supervision” until April 2023 because of his mental health problems, Ricard said. The public prosecutor added that “one of the conclusions to be drawn” is that “there must be obligations regarding psychiatric care”. Since April, Rajabpour-Miyandoab has been under surveillance by the French secret services because of his Islamic fundamentalist profile. The public prosecutor confirmed that other members of the attacker’s entourage were in police custody. According to Le Parisien, they are his parents and sister. In cases of suspected jihadism, it is common for the French authorities to detain members of the suspect’s family or close circle in order to obtain information or find out if they themselves are involved.EFE atc/mcd"

Jean-Francois Ricard said in a news conference that suspect Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab could face a preliminary charge of murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise. He said Rajabpour-Miyandoab is a French national who is being held in police custody. Rajabpour-Miyandoab recorded a video before the attack in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State group and expressed support for Islamic extremists operating in various areas, including in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Egypt's Sinai, Yemen, Iran and Pakistan, Ricard said. The video, in Arabic, was published on Rajabpour-Miyandoa's account on X, formerly Twitter, where his recent posts included references to the Israel-Hamas war, the prosecutor said. It wasnât immediately clear if Rajabpour-Miyandoab had legal representation. A message left Sunday with the prosecutorâs office seeking to locate him for comment was not immediately returned. Ricard said Rajabpour-Miyandoab was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris, in a family with no religious affiliation. He converted to Islam at the age of 18 and quickly adhered to Islamic extremist ideology, he said. In 2016, he had planned to join the Islamic State group in Syria. The same year, he was convicted and imprisoned for four years, until 2020, on a charge of planning violence. He was under psychiatric treatment and was on a special list for feared radicals, the prosecutor confirmed. Since the end earlier this year of a probation period during which he received mandatory psychiatric care, Rajabpour-Miyandoab was placed under the surveillance of intelligence services, Ricard said. His mother had in October expressed âconcernsâ over her son isolating himself, but no evidence was found that could have led to criminal proceedings, he added. Three other people from Rajabpour-Miyandoab's entourage and family have been detained by police for questioning, Ricard said. The apparently random attack near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the river in an unprecedented scenic start in the heart of Paris. In a sign of that concern, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a meeting for Sunday evening with key ministers and officials charged with security for a âtotal reviewâ of measures in place and the handling of the âmost dangerous individuals,â her office said. After killing the tourist, the attacker crossed the bridge to the cityâs Right Bank and injured two people, a British and a French national, with a hammer, authorities said. Ricard said both of them were able to get back home on Sunday. Video circulating on the internet showed police officers, weapons drawn, cornering a man dressed in black, his face covered and what appeared to be a knife in his right hand. The suspect cried âAllahu Akbarâ (God is great) and a police officer twice tasered the suspect before arresting him, authorities said. Questioned by police, the suspect expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, Darmanin said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on X that the news from Paris was âshocking.â âMy thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German man,â she wrote. âAlmost his entire life was before him. ... Hate and terror have no place in Europe.â Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, in a post on X, expressed condolences for the victim's family and friends and hope that Europe stands together against terrorism. âA heartfelt thought to the family members and loved ones of the victim,"" she wrote. âMay Europe stay united against every form of terrorism."" The French media widely reported that the man, who lived with his parents in the Essonne region, outside Paris, was of Iranian origin. âThis person was ready to kill others,â Darmanin told reporters, who along with other government members and President Emmanuel Macron praised police officers for their response. Well-known emergency physician Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV there was a large quantity of blood. Pelloux said he was told by the victim's entourage that the suspect stopped them to ask for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the victim. âHe aimed at the head, then the back. He knew where to strike,â Pelloux said. Ricard, the prosecutor, said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with one of the two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray. He said the suspect was also in touch with the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russiaâs Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The Saturday attack brought into sharp focus authorities' concern for potential terrorist violence during the 2024 Games. Just days earlier, the Paris police chief had unveiled detailed plans for the Olympic Games' security in Paris, with zones where traffic will be restricted and people will be searched. The police chief, Laurent Nunez, said one of their concerns is that vehicles could be used as battering rams to plow through Olympic crowds. Speaking Sunday evening on TF1 television about security concerns during the Olympics, Darmanin said this year's Rugby World Cup ""took place in good conditions. So did the Popeâs visit to Marseille, and so did the King and Queen of England (visit to France).â He added that police plans prior to the attack include a security perimeter with checkpoints around the Eiffel Tower. Associated Press writers John Leicester in Paris and Frances D'Emilio in Rome contributed to this report."

The rampage took place before dawn at a house in Far Rockaway, a seaside section of Queens. Police were summoned to the home at about 5:10 a.m. when a âyoung female caller"" dialed 911 and said her cousin was killing her family, the NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said at a morning news briefing. When the officers pulled up to the driveway, they stopped a man leaving the area with luggage and after just a few seconds, he drew a knife and attacked. One of the officers was stabbed in the area of his neck and chest, the other was slashed in the head before one of them shot the assailant, Maddrey said. An 11-year old girl was found in front of the house and taken to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead from stab wounds. Police werenât immediately able to enter the home because of a fire that consumed the living room and foyer, but once inside they found three more people fatally stabbed; a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman and a man in his 30s. Another woman, 61, was gravely injured in the attack. She is in critical condition suffering from multiple stab wounds. Both injured police officers are expected to recover. Phone messages left with possible neighbors of the family were not immediately returned. The suspect was identified as Courtney Gordon, 38, who police said had been visiting the family from his home in the Bronx. The identities of his victims were not immediately disclosed. âThis scene was chaos. Multiple victims, a house on fire, and a madman on a rampage, on a mission,"" Patrick Hendry, the head of the New York Police Department's police union, said at the media briefing. âThe skill that this police officer had shooting and stopping the threat after he was being stabbed. Unbelievable skill,"" he said. The fatal attack came a week after another knife rampage in the Bronx that took three lives. Police said a college student who had been âhearing voicesâ killed his father, his 5-year-old half-brother and the little boy's mother."

(KABC) -- The Los Angeles Police Department released new body camera footage that shows the moments before officers shot and killed a knife-wielding suspect outside the popular Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas. The incident happened on the evening of Nov. 1 when officers received a call about a man armed with a machete on Avenue San Luis. Police said the suspect had attacked someone with the machete outside of a McDonald's. The victim was able to disarm the suspect of the machete, but the suspect then pulled out a knife. In newly released audio of the 911 call made that night, you can hear the distressed victim rushing for help. ""I was just attacked by a man with a machete ... in Calabasas at the McDonald's,"" he said. The armed suspect was later identified as Benjamin Pritchard. In the video, you can see arriving officers quickly spotting Pritchard in a nearby parking lot. Soon after, Pritchard takes off running. The video shows officers following him in their patrol vehicles. At one point, they even drove into the McDonald's drive-thru. Soon after, officers catch up to Pritchard as he approached the 101 freeway. At that moment, Pritchard is seen lunging at the officers' vehicle with a knife, clearly visible in his hand. He continues running away toward oncoming traffic. ""Hey! Drop that knife!"" an officer yells. ""Suspect's going to be now armed with a bottle and a knife."" The officer then used the vehicle's loudspeaker to warn drivers about the potential danger. ""Lock your windows! Move! Move!"" he says. Pritchard, however, continues to run and heads straight toward the Sagebrush Cantina restaurant. ""Everybody get inside the restaurant and lock the doors,"" an officer announces. ""This is the LAPD! Lock the doors!"" Officers then chase Pritchard into a patio area, just outside the restaurant. They deployed a Taser twice, but Pritchard then turned toward them with the knife, prompting them to open fire. ""If he goes in that restaurant shoot!"" an officer yells. ""Drop the knife! Shots fired!"" Pritchard was struck by gunfire and taken to a hospital where he later died. As for the victim of the machete attack, he did not sustain any serious injuries. No officers were injured. Meanwhile, both the machete and knife were recovered at the scene. The investigation remains ongoing."

The suspect was taken to an area hospital where he was later pronounced deceased. No officers were harmed in the shooting. Chief Joe Sullivan of the WPD says the incident was tragic and he is confident that officers handled the situation according to policy.

Six of the killings were in Little Rock, and one was in North Little Rock. So far this year, law enforcement officers have investigated 55 homicides in Little Rock, 19 in North Little Rock, two in Sherwood, one in Jacksonville and six in the unincorporated areas of the county. The killings in the unincorporated areas include a double homicide being investigated by the Arkansas State Police because it was initially thought to be outside the jurisdiction of the sheriff's office. In the capital city, November's death toll was one higher than the one reported last November but equal to the total reported in November 2021. The last three Novembers have all been deadlier than November 2020, when just two slayings were reported in the city. By the end of this November, the 55 homicides in Little Rock represented a roughly 27% decrease from the 75 reported in the first 11 months of 2022. That year, the number of killings in Little Rock reached 81, surpassing the previous record of 76 reported in 1993. North Little Rock's single homicide made last month one of the least deadly months so far this year in the city. The total was notably lower than the five homicides reported last November and the three reported in both November 2021 and November 2020. In the first 11 months of 2022, North Little Rock police investigated 21 homicides, translating to a roughly 9% decrease in killings in the city so far this year. The Pulaski County sheriff's office has so far this year also marked a drop in homicides, going from nine killings by the end of November 2022 to four so far this year, a decrease of about 55%. The youngest person killed last month was 17 and the oldest was 47, placing the average age of a homicide victim in November -- 28 years old -- slightly below the average of about 31 across the first 11 months of 2023. All of the people killed in November were Black. It was the fifth month this year in which all of the month's homicide victims were Black. So far this year, 70 -- about 83% -- of homicide victims were Black, while 11 -- about 13% -- were white and 3 -- about 4% -- were Hispanic. The rate at which Black people are killed in Pulaski County is more than double their proportion of the population in Little Rock -- 41% -- and Pulaski County -- 39% -- and a little less than double their proportion in North Little Rock, where they make up 44% of the population, U.S. Census Bureau records show. All but one of the people killed in November were men. So far this year, 71, or about 85%, of those killed were men, while 13, or about 15%, were women. Every one of the people killed in November died of gunshot wounds. Of the 79 homicides so far this year in which authorities have provided a cause of death, 68, or 86%, were shooting deaths. The first homicide of the month came Nov. 4, when Little Rock police investigated the killing of Maryam Ballard, 47, of North Little Rock, who was found shot dead in the road near 2407 S. Cross St. Detectives had yet to publicly identify any suspects in Ballard's killing by Saturday. On Nov. 5, Little Rock officers responding to a report of a shooting at The Canopy apartments at 9201 Kanis Road located Carlos Thurman, 19, of Little Rock shot. Thurman was taken to an area hospital but died of his wounds. Authorities had not publicly identified any suspects in Thurman's slaying by Saturday. Little Rock police on Nov. 13 responded to a report of a shooting outside the Amazon Fulfillment Center at 7001 Zeuber Road, where they found Xanus Robinson, 18, of Jacksonville shot. Robinson died of his wounds at an area hospital. Police had yet to publicly identify any suspects in Robinson's killing Saturday. On Nov. 18, Little Rock police responding to a report of a shooting at the West Park Executive Building at 7101 W. 12th St. found Marcus Marbley, 17, of Little Rock shot dead in a vehicle outside the office building. Detectives determined the shooting had happened on the fourth floor of the building, and made contact with three other shooting victims who had been injured and gone to area hospitals for treatment after the shooting. Police had yet to publicly identify any suspects in Marbley's slaying Saturday. On Nov. 20, Little Rock police responding to a report of a person shot outside the Citgo convenience store at 5924 Baseline Road located Robert Overton, 28, who died of his wounds at the scene. While gathering evidence and reviewing surveillance footage from the area, detectives observed a Nissan Maxima that had been in the area of the shooting for up to an hour before Overton's killing, an affidavit written by a detective states. The person who killed Overton fired from the window of the Nissan, which is registered to Joseph Walker, 40, of Sherwood, the affidavit states. Sherwood police notified Little Rock detectives that they had served a search warrant at Walker's residence and vehicle related to a separate incident on Nov. 20 and observed a rifle in a bag in the home and spent shell casings in the vehicle, the affidavit states. Sherwood officers arrested Walker on a second-degree criminal impersonation charge Nov. 22, the Pulaski County jail's online inmate roster showed. Little Rock police also searched Walker's residence after getting a warrant and reported finding the rifle, more spent shell casings and ""green tip"" ammunition that matched projectiles pulled from the convenience store wall behind where Overton was standing when he was shot. The affidavit doesn't list the caliber of the rifle Walker used, but ""green tip"" rounds usually refer to a .223 caliber round -- the bullet fired by most AR-15-style rifles -- that has a steel tip embedded in the lead bullet to allow the round to penetrate barriers or light body armor more easily. These style of bullets are regularly used by the U.S. military, but are available on the civilian market. Walker was also seen on video footage entering the convenience store shortly before the shooting, and a distinctive tattoo on his leg helped police positively identify him, the affidavit states. He was charged with capital murder in Overton's death Nov. 29 and was being held in the Pulaski County jail Saturday evening. North Little Rock police responding on Nov. 21 to a report of a person shot at a residence in the 1500 block of West 35th Street located Jason Smith, 43, of North Little Rock inside. Smith died of his wounds at an area hospital. Authorities had yet to publicly identify any suspects in Smith's slaying Saturday. Little Rock police on Nov. 27 responded to a report of a ""subject down"" near 2800 Boyle Park Road and located Avron Britton, 21, of College Station lying dead in the road. Police have yet to publicly identify any suspects in Britton's killing by Saturday. By the end of November, Little Rock police had made arrests in 30 of the 50 separate homicide investigations opened by the department. Some incidents had multiple deceased victims, while others had multiple suspects arrested. A further two cases were closed by exception because the leading suspects died by suicide just after the victims were killed, and three more cases were in file review, a process in which a prosecutor reviews the case file created by police to determine if criminal charges are warranted. By that same date, North Little Rock police had made arrests in nine of their 19 homicide investigations. One more of their cases was in file review, while another was the police shooting of an armed suspect. Pulaski County deputies have arrested suspects in all four of their homicide investigations so far this year. Sherwood police, who have not had a homicide reported in their jurisdiction since July, have made arrests in half of their two homicide investigations so far this year.

While the details of what led to the knife attack are still unclear, police said they believe the suspect and the majority of the victims were all family members. Two of the victims were pre-teen children. During a news conference, New York Police Department Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said a 911 call came in just after 5 a.m. from a young woman who said her cousin was killing her family members. Two officers responded to a group of homes on E 22nd Street in the Far Rockaway neighborhood where the call came from. When they got to the home, they saw a man in the driveway carrying luggage who appeared to be leaving, Maddrey said. The officers approached the man and asked if he had seen or heard anything. Maddrey said the man drew a knife and stabbed one officer in the neck and the second officer in the head before one of them was able to take out their gun and shoot the attacker. Both officers, who have over a decade of service in the police force, were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and are expected to be okay, Maddrey said. As police continued to investigate the scene, they found an 11-year-old girl who was dead from apparent stab wounds right outside of the home. A couch had been set on fire inside the home, preventing officers from getting inside until the fire department responded to put it out. Once they were able to enter, they found more victims. A 12-year-old boy, a man in his 30s and a 44-year-old woman were all found stabbed to death in bedrooms in the back of the home. A 61-year-old woman, also suffering from stab wounds, was taken from the home to a local hospital for treatment and is currently in critical condition, police said. The suspect was identified as 38-year-old Courtney Gordon. After he was shot by officers, he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Police said Gordon had one prior arrest on record for strangulation in a domestic incident, but that incident occurred in the Bronx. It is believed he used a ""typical kitchen steak knife"" in the attack, according to police. The investigation is ongoing. Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com"

The suspect also started a fire at the house and then stabbed two police officers who arrived at the scene before being shot dead by one of them, according to New York Police Department officials. About 5:10 a.m. police received an emergency call from a young woman who said that her cousin was killing her family members, the chief of department, Jeffrey Maddrey, said at a news conference Sunday morning. Two officers who responded to the location, 467 Beach 22nd St. in the Far Rockaway neighborhood, saw a man leaving with luggage, Maddrey said. When they stopped him, the man stabbed one officer in the head and the other in the neck with a steak knife before one of the officers shot him. The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The wounds of the officers were not life-threatening, Maddrey said at the news conference, which was in front of Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where they were being treated. As other officers arrived, they found an 11-year-old girl lying in front of the house, and she was pronounced dead, Maddrey said. The house had been set on fire, and the officers could enter the home only after firefighters had extinguished the fire. They found three more victims inside two bedrooms at the back of the home: a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman and a man in his 30s, all of whom they believed had been stabbed to death, he said. Officers also found a 61-year-old woman, who had multiple stab wounds and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. It was unclear whether the same knife had been used for all the victims. Joseph Kenny, the department’s chief of detectives, identified the suspect as Courtney Gordon, 38, whom police believe was a resident of the Bronx and was visiting family members in Queens. Police said Sunday that the motive of the attack was under investigation and that the 9-1-1 caller was being questioned. This article originally appeared in The New York Times."

(WLNS) — Lansing Police Department held a news conference Sunday regarding the deadly officer-involved shooting late Friday night in Lansing. Police shot Stephen Luis Romero, 33, during the response. Romero was later pronounced dead at the hospital, LPD Chief Ellery Sosebee said. At 11:19 p.m. Friday, Ingham County Central Dispatch received a 911 emergency call “for a domestic assault in progress in the 1600 block of Massachusetts,” Sosebee said. Adding that at 11:23 p.m., officers were assigned to the call and began the response. A neighbor placed an emergency call at 11:24 p.m., saying they heard a gunshot and the sound of a woman crying. At 11:25 p.m., emergency dispatchers advised that the call was considered a shooting incident. Dispatch also said that “a female has been shot.” At 11:26 p.m., a witness told responders, “A woman is outside screaming she had been shot,” Sosebee said. At that point, LPD officers arrived on the scene, Sosebee said. The Chief said officers found a man standing next to a car with an open door in the driveway, with a woman sitting in the car seat by the open door. Officers gave repeated commands to the man “to show his hands and to get on the ground,” Sosebee said. During that encounter, police claim the man showed a gun, “and officers engage[d] him at that point.” At 11:27, he said, the officers told dispatch that shots had been fired. The officers approached the man and moved him away from the car, checking on the status of the woman in the car, who was the original caller. At that point, officers realized she had not been shot, police said. Officers began CPR on the man until the Lansing Fire Department arrived and took over before taking him to a hospital, police said. Chief Sosebee would not say whether Romero had shot at the officers or not, saying, “That’s part of the investigation, and I don’t want to compromise the integrity of the case.” The Chief also said he could not release the information on whether anyone else was injured in the incident. Two LPD officers are now on paid administrative leave, Sosebee said. Michigan State Police is investigating the incident. Once MSP has gathered information and reviewed the video involved in the shooting, Sosebee will review and release the names of the officers involved, along with the video, he said."

Jean-Francois Ricard said in a news conference that suspect Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab could face a preliminary charge of murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise. He said Rajabpour-Miyandoab is a French national who is being held in police custody. Rajabpour-Miyandoab recorded a video before the attack in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State group and expressed support for Islamic extremists operating in various areas, including in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Egypt’s Sinai, Yemen, Iran and Pakistan, Ricard said. The video, in Arabic, was published on Rajabpour-Miyandoa’s account on X, formerly Twitter, where his recent posts included references to the Israel-Hamas war, the prosecutor said. It wasn’t immediately clear if Rajabpour-Miyandoab had legal representation. A message left Sunday with the prosecutor’s office seeking to locate him for comment was not immediately returned. Ricard said Rajabpour-Miyandoab was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris, in a family with no religious affiliation. He converted to Islam at the age of 18 and quickly adhered to Islamic extremist ideology, he said. In 2016, he had planned to join the Islamic State group in Syria. The same year, he was convicted and imprisoned for four years, until 2020, on a charge of planning violence. He was under psychiatric treatment and was on a special list for feared radicals, the prosecutor confirmed. Since the end earlier this year of a probation period during which he received mandatory psychiatric care, Rajabpour-Miyandoab was placed under the surveillance of intelligence services, Ricard said. His mother had in October expressed “concerns” over her son isolating himself, but no evidence was found that could have led to criminal proceedings, he added. Three other people from Rajabpour-Miyandoab’s entourage and family have been detained by police for questioning, Ricard said. The apparently random attack near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the river in an unprecedented scenic start in the heart of Paris. In a sign of that concern, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a meeting for Sunday evening with key ministers and officials charged with security for a “total review” of measures in place and the handling of the “most dangerous individuals,” her office said. After killing the tourist, the attacker crossed the bridge to the city’s Right Bank and injured two people, a British and a French national, with a hammer, authorities said. Ricard said both of them were able to get back home on Sunday. Video circulating on the internet showed police officers, weapons drawn, cornering a man dressed in black, his face covered and what appeared to be a knife in his right hand. The suspect cried “Allahu Akbar” (God is great) and a police officer twice tasered the suspect before arresting him, authorities said. Questioned by police, the suspect expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, Darmanin said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on X that the news from Paris was “shocking.” “My thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German man,” she wrote. “Almost his entire life was before him. … Hate and terror have no place in Europe.” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, in a post on X, expressed condolences for the victim’s family and friends and hope that Europe stands together against terrorism. “A heartfelt thought to the family members and loved ones of the victim,” she wrote. “May Europe stay united against every form of terrorism.” The French media widely reported that the man, who lived with his parents in the Essonne region, outside Paris, was of Iranian origin. “This person was ready to kill others,” Darmanin told reporters, who along with other government members and President Emmanuel Macron praised police officers for their response. Well-known emergency physician Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV there was a large quantity of blood. Pelloux said he was told by the victim’s entourage that the suspect stopped them to ask for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the victim. “He aimed at the head, then the back. He knew where to strike,” Pelloux said. Ricard, the prosecutor, said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with one of the two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray. He said the suspect was also in touch with the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia’s Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The Saturday attack brought into sharp focus authorities’ concern for potential terrorist violence during the 2024 Games. Just days earlier, the Paris police chief had unveiled detailed plans for the Olympic Games’ security in Paris, with zones where traffic will be restricted and people will be searched. The police chief, Laurent Nunez, said one of their concerns is that vehicles could be used as battering rams to plow through Olympic crowds. Speaking Sunday evening on TF1 television about security concerns during the Olympics, Darmanin said this year’s Rugby World Cup “took place in good conditions. So did the Pope’s visit to Marseille, and so did the King and Queen of England (visit to France).” He added that police plans prior to the attack include a security perimeter with checkpoints around the Eiffel Tower. ___ Associated Press writers John Leicester in Paris and Frances D’Emilio in Rome contributed to this report."

The national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office now seized will be responsible for shedding light on this matter so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.”Â “We will not give in to terrorism. Never,” French Prime Minister Ãlisabeth Borne wrote on X. The suspect previously served four years in jail for plotting another attack in 2016. Born in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, a Paris suburb, the accused attacker was released from prison in 2020, was under surveillance and undergoing psychiatric treatment, and was most recently living with his parents in the Essonne region, south of Paris, Darmanin said. “This person was ready to kill others,” Darmanin told reporters. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock described the incident as a “suspected Islamist attack.”Â “Shocking news from #Paris,” Baerbock wrote on X. “My thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German who was killed in the suspected Islamist attack. Almost his entire life lay ahead of him. Get well soon to the injured. Hate and terror have no place in Europe.” PROTESTS OVER FRENCH TEENâS FATAL STABBING LEAD TO CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON âFAR-RIGHT’ Authorities said the accused attacker, who has not been identified by name, went after a German couple with a knife shortly after 9 p.m. on the Quai de Grenelle, not far from the Eiffel Tower. A 23-year-old man who was a German-Filipino citizen died from his injuries. A taxi driver reportedly tried to intervene in the attack near the Bir Hakeim bridge, an area popular with tourists, but the suspect ran across to the other side of the River Seine to the Right Bank, attacking two others with a hammer.Â A 66-year-old British man and a 60-year-old French national were hurt, The Guardian reported. The accused attacker was stopped by police, who twice fired a taser at him in the stomach, Darmanin said, praising the officers for their quick response and reiterating that “there would doubtless have been other dead.” France has been under a heightened terror alert since the October fatal stabbing of a teacher, Dominique Bernard, in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia’s Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization.Â That fatal attack came three years after another teacher, Samuel Paty, was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. Six teenagers are on trial in Paris for allegedly inciting the murder after Paty showed a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad in class during a discussion on the French ideals of secularism and freedom of expression.Â CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Saturday attack raised the fear level in the French capital, still marked by the 2015 attacks on cafÃ©s and a music hall by Islamist radicals that killed 130 people.

The New York Police Department said 38-year-old Courtney Gordon was shot and killed at the scene after he attacked two officers outside the house. Police didn't identify the victims by name but described them as an 11-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, and a man in his 30s. A fifth person, a 61-year-old woman, was stabbed multiple times and taken to a hospital, where police said she is in critical condition. Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey broke the news at a media briefing from the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. He said a ""young female"" called 911 around 5:10 a.m. local time and told dispatchers her cousin was killing family members in a Queens home. Maddrey said when police arrived at the scene, they saw a man who was carrying luggage and walking down the driveway. The man then stabbed one of the officers in the neck and chest before slashing the other officer in the head. Police said one of the officers shot the suspect. He was taken to the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and pronounced dead. Maddrey said a young girl was found dead outside the home, which was on fire. Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny said investigators believe the suspect set fire to a couch inside the home after the murders. Once the fire department put out the fire, police went inside the home and found three more bodies, as well as the fifth victim. Maddrey said police found what they believe is the murder weapon -- a steak knife -- in the house. The investigation will determine if this was used to harm all the victims,"" Maddrey said. Kenny said Gordon had one previous arrest, as he was charged in connection to a strangulation/domestic violence incident in the Bronx. ""It seems he was a Bronx resident who was visiting family members at this location,"" Kenny said. The president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York also spoke at the briefing. He described the suspect as a madman and praised responding officers, who included a a 28-year veteran and a 16-year veteran. ""This scene was chaos -- multiple victims, a house on fire, and a madman on a rampage, on a mission,"" he said. ""I'm thankful that these police officers showed up. Imagine what could have happened if these police officers weren't there."" ""This madman tried to kill -- after he killed others -- a New York City police officer. The skill that this police officer had (by) shooting and stopping the threat after he was being stabbed -- unbelievable skill. I know both these police officers personally. (They) did an unbelievable job. True professionals,"" he continued. ""(They) are great men who were doing their jobs. And again, thank God they were there ... how many more victims could there have been if these skilled, professional police officers did not show up to this scene,"" he added."" Maddrey said the officers are recovering at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center while the investigation continues to be ongoing. ""These are two experienced police officers ... they did an excellent job,"" he said."

The random attack near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the river in an unprecedented scenic start in the heart of Paris. In a sign of that concern, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a meeting for Sunday evening with key ministers and officials charged with security for a “total review” of measures in place and the handling of the “most dangerous individuals,” her office said. After killing the tourist, the attacker crossed the bridge to the city’s Right Bank and wounded two people with a hammer, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Saturday night. The suspect, who apparently cried “Allahu Akbar” (God is great), was then arrested. Video circulating on the internet showed police officers, weapons drawn, cornering a man dressed in black, his face covered and what appeared to be a knife in his right hand. They twice tasered the suspect before arresting him, Darmanin said. Questioned by police, the suspect expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, Darmanin said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on X, formerly Twitter, that the news from Paris was “shocking.” “My thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German man,” she wrote. “Almost his entire life was before him. … Hate and terror have no place in Europe.” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, in a post on X, expressed condolences for the victim’s family and friends and hope that Europe stands together against terrorism. “A heartfelt thought to the family members and loved ones of the victim,” she wrote. “May Europe stay united against every form of terrorism.” The French interior minister said the suspect was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris. He had been convicted and jailed for four years, until 2020, for planning violence, was under psychiatric treatment, tracked for suspected Islamic radicalization and was on a special list for feared radicals. The French media widely reported that the man, who lived with his parents in the Essonne region, outside Paris, was of Iranian origin. The case was turned over to the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office. “This person was ready to kill others,” Darmanin told reporters, who along with other government members and President Emmanuel Macron praised police officers for their response. Well-known emergency doctor Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV there was blood everywhere. Pelloux said he was told by the victim’s entourage that the suspect stopped them to ask for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the victim. “He aimed at the head, then the back. He knew where to strike,” Pelloux said. The daily Le Parisien, in an in-depth report published Sunday, said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray and the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia’s Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The attack brought into sharp focus authorities’ concern for potential terrorist violence during the 2024 Games. Just days earlier, the Paris police chief had unveiled detailed plans for the Olympic Games’ security in Paris, with zones where traffic will be restricted and people will be searched. The police chief, Laurent Nunez, said one of their concerns is that vehicles could be used as battering rams to plow through Olympic crowds."

Two officers from the 101st Precinct area in Far Rockaway, Queens responded to the residential distress call at 467 Beach 22nd St. after the 911 call was made around 5:10 a.m. When police arrived, they saw a male walking out of a home carrying luggage, the NYPD said. After a brief encounter with the patrolmen, Gordon drew a knife, stabbing one officer in the neck and chest area, according to police. In response to the attack, one of the officers used his firearm to end the carnage. âHe strikes the second officer in the head,â said Maddrey. âOur 28-year veteran is able to draw his firearm, heâs able to discharge his weapon to stop the assault and he was able to stop the perpetrator.â Upon entering the home, the officers found a 12-year-old boy, 44-year-old woman, and a man in his 30s dead inside the residence. Cops found an 11-year-old girl in the residence who had also been stabbed. She was transported to Cohen Childrenâs Medical Center, Queens, where she died. A 61-year-old woman at the home also suffered multiple stab wounds. Sheâs currently at an area hospital, officials said. According to police, after stabbing his relatives, Gordon lit the couch on fire as he made his escape. The two officers and Gordon were removed to local area hospitals. The suspect was pronounced dead on arrival, authorities said. He had been previously arrested in the Bronx for strangulation in a domestic violence incident, officials said. Gordan was a visitor to the home, not a resident, police said. The injured two police officers are expected to make a full recovery.

Two officers were injured during a fight between the suspect and Spokane police officers, with one officer taken to a hospital, according to police Chief Craig Meidl. First-aid measures were performed on the suspect, but he “succumbed to his injuries” on the scene, according to a news release. At 9:16 a.m., a Spokane police officer at the Walmart located at 9200 N. Colton St. became aware of the suspect in the process of “taking things” from the store, Meidl said. The officer called for backup, and a second officer arrived. They contacted the suspect on the north side of the store, near the entrances, and tried to take him into custody. “At that point a fight ensued; it was a very prolonged fight that continued into the store,” Meidl said. “During the process of that fight, one officer fired their weapon.” Officers put out a call that shots had been fired at 10:28 a.m. Meidl said he does not know how many shots were fired. The fight occurred in what Meidl said was “a very large area,” all within the Walmart. Officers located what appeared to be a firearm and ammunition belonging to the suspect, and police stun guns that appeared to have been deployed during the fight. The Walmart was evacuated; Meidl said he was not aware of any injured bystanders. Meidl said the Walmart will remain closed until responding officers investigate the scene, which was expected to take “several hours.” The Spokane Independent Investigative Response team is investigating the officer shooting. The officer who fired his weapon was placed on incident review leave, according to a news release. Both officers wore body cameras. The Spokane County Medical Examiner’s Office will release the man’s identity and cause and manner of death."

Stein recalls saying something like, âI donât have the fâ-â-âking time to deal with this fâ-â-âking brain-damaged guy,â referring to a team member who had suffered a traumatic brain injury in a bike accident. Although he apologized, Googleâs management initiated an investigation that culminated in his termination from the company. Seven years later, Stein is the founder and CEO of bustling startup Kadima Careers, which helps job seekers navigate the interview process and negotiate their salaries. But was what Stein did so bad? Google chose not to comment, but did Steinâs outburst warrant being fired? âMistakes, we all make them. We are human,â said Eduardo BriceÃ±o, author of âThe Performance Paradox: Turning the Power of Mindset into Actionâ (Ballantine Books). âSome errors lead to termination, while others become catalysts for improvement, innovation and serve as valuable lessons leading to professional growth.â Consider the case of Anna Peterson, owner of Annaâs Essence, a beauty salon formerly in Flushing, Queens. Peterson accidentally dyed a customerâs hair green instead of ash blond. The mistake surfaced mid-application, so Peterson worked tirelessly to correct the color, and extended complimentary pampering services to make amends. The mistake cost Peterson time and money and put her salonâs reputation at risk, but also offered her an important lesson and led to new procedures that ensure something like that never happens again. âThis incident was humbling and taught us the invaluable lesson of double-checking our work, especially when under pressure,â said Peterson. âIt led to the implementation of a two-person verification system which eradicated such errors and unexpectedly improved team collaboration.â In a parallel narrative, Tihanna Louise McCleese, an ambitious news reporter in San Francisco, once faced a career-altering mistake. Eager to make a mark, McCleese covered a high-profile story about an Iraq War veteran shot by police. Under immense pressure to win an exclusive interview, McCleese snuck into the ICU of the hospital that was treating the vet. While her reporting initially garnered national attention and praise, the consequences were severe â including a furious boss. On reflection, McCleese acknowledged her flawed response to the situation, but âthe experience highlighted the importance of ethical decision-making, effective communication and taking responsibility for mistakes,â she said. These invaluable lessons gave birth to McCleeseâs current work as a coach and consultant at Tihanna Louise Careers. When it comes to professional advancement, rÃ©sumÃ©s are often considered key. And although lying on them is apparently commonplace, âdonât do it. If you deliberately lie and get caught, itâs over,â said Marlo Lyons, a career coach and award-winning author of âWanted -> A New Career: The Definitive Playbook for Transitioning to a New Career or Finding Your Dream Jobâ (Future Forward Publishing). Too bad that congressman âLyinâââ George Santos didnât follow her advice. Mistakes in the C-suite may also be prevalent, âonly their miscalculations tend to be sins of omission,â said Jerry Colonna, author of âReunion: Leadership and the Longing to Belongâ (Harper Business). You donât have to prove that to Trent Griffin-Braaf, CEO and founder of Tech Valley Shuttle, a Cohoes, NY, company that aims to combat poverty through transportation. âOne of the biggest mistakes I made was not removing someone from the team sooner than we did,â he said, adding that because the individual brought valuable expertise, he turned a blind eye to his lack of people skills. âThat misjudgment cost the company money in lost wages, rehiring and training new employees because of high turnover [and] because of the toxic traits this person had. The morale of the team was down. You could feel it in the air,â said Griffin-Braaf. Once he handed the employee his pink slip, morale went back up. Mistakes happen to the best of us, so hereâs how to discuss common blunders in the professional realm and what to do to address them. Living a lie Mistake: Spicing up your rÃ©sumÃ© with a dash of fiction about your experience, education, skills and/or job history. Fallout: Lost credibility, getting fired or being charged with fraud. Advice: Tell the truth, or risk facing the consequences. Getting caught in a lie could cost you your job or leave you in a perpetual state of anxiety. If youâve had a change of heart post-fib but havenât landed a new gig, hustle to the applicant portal and straighten out your records before anyone notices. And if the catâs out of the bag, but youâre still hanging on, itâs time to dust off that true rÃ©sumÃ© and start hunting for a fresh opportunity. Fight club Mistake: A fiery clash with a colleague, creating an untenable working relationship thatâs contagious. Fallout: Challenges in collaboration and cooperation, leading to issues within the team. Advice: Resist the urge to throw shade at each other when chatting with your colleagues. If the two of you are unable to find a resolution independently, seek assistance from the human resources department. Turning a blind eye Mistake: Youâre the manager and you took too long to fire an obnoxious aâhole whose expertise you needed. Fallout: Now, youâre grappling with a shortage in manpower, and itâs akin to attempting to juggle flaming torches without enough hands. Advice: Re-recruit the people who left, or make hiring a priority. In the future, painful as it is to let people go, do it or live with the damage. Fiscal irresponsibility Mistake: Youâve been compensating for your undervalued status by turning the company credit card into a magic wand for personal expenses. Fallout: When you get caught, youâll look like a thief â and thatâs because you are. Advice: Come clean, and maybe claim you didnât do it on purpose. But even if it was, dash over to accounting pronto to figure out how you can patch things up and pay the company back every penny."

The random attack near the Eiffel Tower has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the river in an unprecedented scenic start in the heart of Paris. After killing the tourist, the suspect crossed the bridge to the cityâs Right Bank and wounded two people with a hammer, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Saturday night. The suspect, who apparently cried âAllahu Akbarâ (God is great), was arrested. Video circulating on the internet showed police officers, weapons drawn, cornering a man dressed in black, his face covered and what appeared to be a knife in his right hand. They twice tasered the suspect before arresting him, Darmanin said. Questioned by police, the suspect expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, Darmanin said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on X, formerly Twitter, that the news from Paris was âshocking.â PHOTOS: The fatal stabbing of a German tourist by a suspected radical puts sharp focus on the Paris Olympics âMy thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German man,â she wrote. âAlmost his entire life was before him. … Hate and terror have no place in Europe.â The French interior minister said the suspect was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris. He had been convicted and jailed for four years, until 2020, for planning violence, was under psychiatric treatment, tracked for suspected Islamic radicalization and was on a special list for feared radicals. The French media widely reported that the man, who lived with his parents in the Essonne region, outside Paris, was of Iranian origin. The case was turned over to the anti-terrorism prosecutorâs office. âThis person was ready to kill others,â Darmanin told reporters, who along with other government members and President Emmanuel Macron praised police officers for their response. Well-known emergency doctor Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV there was blood everywhere. Pelloux said he was told by the victim’s entourage that the suspect stopped them to ask for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the victim. âHe aimed at the head, then the back. He knew where to strike,â Pelloux said. The daily Le Parisien, in an in-depth report published Sunday, said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray and the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russiaâs Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The attack brought into sharp focus authorities’ concern for potential terrorist violence during the 2024 Games. Just days earlier, the Paris police chief had unveiled detailed plans for the Olympic Games‘ security in Paris, with zones where traffic will be restricted and people will be searched. The police chief, Laurent Nunez, said one of their concerns is that vehicles could be used as battering rams to plow through Olympic crowds. Copyright © 2023 The Washington Times, LLC.

Authorities responded to the incident at 467 Beach 22nd St. between Brookhaven and Elk Drive in Far Rockaway at around 5:10 a.m., according to the NYPD. The young 911 caller said her cousin was killing her family members, according to NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey. Four people were pronounced dead at the scene and a 61-year-old woman was taken to the hospital in critical condition with multiple stab wounds, police said. The suspect, Courtney Gordon, fatally stabbed an 11-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy, a 44-year-old woman, and a man in his 30s at the home before setting the couch on fire on his way out the door, Maddrey said. Two cops spotted Gordon, 38, near the home carrying luggage and stopped him to ask some questions, police said. The suspect then pulled a kitchen steak knife and slashed one officer in the neck and the other in the head, Maddrey said. One of the officers shot Gordon, who was pronounced dead after arriving at the hospital, officials said. The cops were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. The FDNY also responded to the house fire at around 5:17 a.m., officials said. After firefighters put out the blaze, the officers were able to enter the home. The girl was found in the front entrance and the other three victims were found in two back bedrooms, police said. The knife was recovered at the scene, police said. The investigation is ongoing.

Two of the officers — Matthew Collins, 40, and Christopher Burbank, 38 — had been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, while Timothy Rankine, 34, was charged with manslaughter. The jury found the three not guilty on all counts. There was a gasp from the gallery when the first not-guilty verdict was read. Rankine sat forward in his seat and wiped his eyes, while Collins hugged his lawyer. Matthew Ericksen, a lawyer representing the Ellis family, said it was hard to convey how devastating the verdict was for the family and community. “The biggest reason why I personally think this jury found reasonable doubt is because the defense was essentially allowed to put Manny Ellis on trial,” Ericksen said via email. “The defense attorneys were allowed to dredge up Manny’s past and repeat to the jury again and again Manny’s prior arrests in 2015 and 2019. That unfairly prejudiced jurors against Manny.” As the sun went down, about 30 people including family members of Ellis gathered near the Manuel Ellis mural in Tacoma, closing an intersection. “No justice, no peace,” they chanted. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office prosecuted the case, said in a statement that he was grateful for the jury, the court and his legal team “for their extraordinary hard work and dedication.” “I know the Ellis family is hurting, and my heart goes out to them,” he said. The Ellis family immediately left the courtroom and planned to speak at a news conference later. The Washington Coalition for Police Accountability said in a statement that “the not guilty verdict is further proof the system is broken, failing the very people it should be serving.” Roger Rogoff, director of the state’s recently created Office of Independent Investigations, which is tasked with investigating police shootings, said he did not want to comment directly on the verdict but expressed sympathy for the Ellis family. “I continue to have empathy and sympathy for the family of Manny Ellis,” Rogoff said. “Anybody who loses a child in that way, it’s tragic, and they’re living with that forever. My heart and our office’s heart goes out to them. I also am aware that the law enforcement officers involved are also impacted significantly, and so I am glad that the trial is over for all people involved.” The Pierce County medical examiner ruled Ellis’ death a homicide caused by oxygen deprivation, but lawyers for the officers said a high level of methamphetamine in Ellis’ system and a heart irregularity were to blame. Witnesses — one of whom yelled for the officers to stop attacking Ellis — and a doorbell surveillance camera captured video of parts of the encounter the night of March 3, 2020. The video showed Ellis with his hands up in a surrender position as Burbank shot a Taser at his chest and Collins wrapped an arm around his neck from behind. The officers later told investigators that Ellis attacked them and was violent. Witnesses testified that they saw no such thing. “When I saw Manuel not doing anything, and him get attacked like that, it wasn’t right,” witness Sara McDowell, 26, said at trial. “I’d never seen police do anything like that. It was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. It was scary. It wasn’t OK.” Collins testified that he lamented Ellis’ death but wouldn’t have done anything differently. He said he never heard Ellis say, repeatedly, that he couldn’t breathe, and he maintained that Ellis started the confrontation by lifting Collins off the ground and throwing him onto his back, something no other witness reported seeing. Another officer, Rankine, called Ellis’ death a tragedy. He was pressing his knees into Ellis’ back when Ellis pleaded for breath. “The only response at that point that I could think of is, ‘If you can talk to me, you can still breathe,’” Rankine said in testimony. Ellis’ death became a touchstone for racial justice demonstrators in the Pacific Northwest, but it also coincided with the first U.S. outbreak of COVID-19 at a nursing home in nearby Kirkland and did not garner the attention that the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis did nearly three months later. The trial, which lasted more than two months, was the first under a 5-year-old state law designed to make it easier to prosecute police accused of wrongfully using deadly force. Ellis was walking home with doughnuts from a 7-Eleven when he passed a patrol car stopped at a red light, with Collins and Burbank inside. After what witnesses said appeared to be a brief conversation between Ellis and the officers, Burbank, in the passenger seat, threw open his door, knocking Ellis down. The officers, both white, tackled and punched Ellis, with one stunning him with a Taser as the other held him in a neck restraint. Among the many other officers who responded was Rankine, who arrived after Ellis was already handcuffed face-down and knelt on the man’s upper back as he pleaded for breath. Video captured Ellis addressing the officers as “sir” while telling them he couldn’t breathe. One officer is heard responding, “Shut the (expletive) up, man.”"

Police said three officers fired at the suspect, who was shot multiple times late Saturday night. Interim Police Chief Robin Henderson said they were still trying to determine who shot the bystanders. She said there were indications that the suspect also fired his gun. Henderson said an employee at the bar along Sixth Street had alerted police to a man with a firearm in the bar. Henderson said that when police approached him, he pulled out the firearm and pointed it at officers and bar patrons. The suspect has not yet been identified. Henderson said that one of the bystanders had critical injuries while the other two had injuries that were not life threatening. Per department protocol, the three officers involved in the shooting will be placed on administrative duty. Henderson said that video from their body cameras will be released within 10 business days.

Legislature to study role of 911 in mental health emergencies",N,"Story by Danielle Ohl of Spotlight PA Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom producing investigative and public-service journalism that holds power to account and drives positive change in Pennsylvania. Sign up for our free newsletters. HARRISBURG â Pennsylvania state legislators earlier this month approved a study of how the 911 system can better assist people experiencing a mental health crisis, a measure championed by the family of Christian Hall ahead of the three-year anniversary of his death. The study seeks ways for emergency dispatchers operating the 911 system to send crisis responders, not police, to someone who calls to report a mental health emergency. On Dec. 30, 2020, a Pennsylvania State Police trooper shot and killed Christian Hall after the 19-year-old called 911 to report a potential suicide in progress. Before the shooting, police arrived to find Hall standing on a bridge and holding what they later determined to be a pellet gun. Authorities at the time said the shooting was justified because the troopers feared for their lives. A Monroe County prosecutor called it a âclassic suicide by cop scenario.â But a 2021 investigation by Spotlight PA and NBC News found Hall had his hands in the air for 14 seconds before police shot and killed him. At a vigil held Dec. 17 in Christianâs honor, Gareth and Fe Hall mourned their son and spoke in support of the expanded mental health resources they believe could have saved his life. âBullets should not be the only resort,â Fe Hall said at the vigil. âBullets should not be the first resort.â The General Assembly funded the new study as part of the recent deal lawmakers struck to enact the state budget. The billâs language directs legislative commissions to examine the 911 system and how it might integrate into the new 988 system, a suicide and crisis hotline launched nationwide in July 2022. It also requires the study to recommend âstandards and procedures which should be followed when a behavioral health crisis is routed to 988 as an alternative to law enforcement,â and requires the recommendations to consider potential cultural and linguistic barriers between responders and the person in crisis. The language originated with a resolution that state Rep. Maureen Madden, a Monroe County Democrat representing the Hall familyâs home district, introduced this fall. Madden took cues from the Halls and the community that mobilized after Christianâs death, she told Spotlight PA. âWe really need to get out there that 988 is there,â Madden said in an interview. âAnd then we need to train people who answer the phone for 911 and have them be able to assess, is this really a 911 call or is this a warm handoff for 988?â With the study approved, Madden is looking to other measures that would provide funding for the 988 system, which as of now relies on federal support. She also wants to pass legislation that would allow the Pennsylvania attorney general to conduct investigations of police shootings instead of district attorneys, whose work with local police departments could present a conflict of interest. Under current law, the attorney general cannot intervene in any criminal case unless the local prosecutor asks for help. The Halls and members of their community have long criticized the way Monroe County District Attorney Michael Mancuso, who was an assistant prosecutor in the office at the time, described their sonâs death. The couple is suing the troopers involved as well as Mancuso, accusing the prosecutor of misleading the public by showing an edited video of the shooting at a subsequent news conference. At the vigil, Gareth and Fe Hall urged their community to spread awareness of the 988 system. Fe, speaking through tears and long pauses, asked those gathered to heed their call for changes to crisis response in Pennsylvania. âChristianâs death should not be in vain,â she said. âNo other family should lose a loved one the way we did, and no other family should grieve the way we do.â BEFORE YOU GOâ¦ If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

(WLNS) – The Lansing Police Department confirmed an officer-involved shooting that left one man dead happened overnight Saturday. According to LPD, officers responded to the 1600 block of Massachusetts Avenue at 11:19 p.m. for reports of a domestic violence situation where a person was armed and someone was shot. LPD added that once police arrived at the scene, an officer encountered an armed suspect and said this was when the police shooting took place. Law enforcement secured the suspect and attempted first aid. The Lansing Fire Department then took the man to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. LPD officials said a handgun was recovered at the scene and there were no other injuries. 6 News spoke to neighbors Saturday afternoon who claimed that the shooting had taken place in the space between two houses on the street. They also said that they had heard two sets of gunshots, and what had appeared to be two different guns. When 6 News made contact with a person at the house where the incident had occurred, they said they were not ready for an interview. They did say, however, that they had lost a loved one at the hands of the Lansing Police Department. Per department policy, the investigation has been turned over to the Michigan State Police."

It’s a relationship that has inspired partnerships and affiliations for years. And it’s a means to our mission of empowering community and making a real difference.” Each year, the University hosts the Carter Town Hall and the Coke Toast — traditions that aim to welcome eager first years to campus through connections to major local cultural and economic powerhouses. The festivities also draw on Emory’s historical ties to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who is a university distinguished professor, and the University’s partnership with the Coca-Cola Company, whose founder Asa Griggs Candler provided the original land grant for Emory to relocate to Atlanta’s Druid Hills neighborhood in 1915. According to University President Gregory Fenves’s 2023 “One Emory” strategic framework, “Emory is a global research university, but [it] also [has] a responsibility to Atlanta, DeKalb County and the entire metro region.” It is ironic, then, when the University conveniently neglects this community responsibility and remains appallingly silent on the issue of Cop City. The name refers to the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, a police training facility already in the early stages of construction. If successfully implemented, the project would devastate the local environment and perpetuate police brutality on the area’s diverse population. The University’s stubborn silence is mirrored in the PATH Foundation’s proposal to construct a multi-use trail that would cause severe ecological damage to nearby forests along South Fork Peachtree Creek. Emory’s position on both causes stipulates how and when students should engage with the wider community, neglecting Atlanta’s past as a microcosm for the nation’s watershed moments and as a historical hub for advocacy and social change. Student Activism Through the Ages Atlanta is the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement and the home of visionaries like Martin Luther King Jr. However, the city is also situated in Georgia, a state that has historically fostered unimaginable violence against communities of color and where the wounds of slavery and Jim Crow laws are still visible. As an academic powerhouse of the region, student activism has long been described as an Emory tradition. In 1961, students petitioned former Emory President S. Walter Martin to admit Black students to the University. In 1969, 500 people rallied on the Quadrangle to present former University President Sanford Atwood with a list of eight protocols demanding action against racism. In 2020, after the brutal murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers and the killing of Ahmaud Arbery by white residents in south Georgia, the Emory Social Justice Coalition sent a letter of demands to the University administration, asking for the creation of a more equitable learning environment. Most recently, the movement against Cop City has permeated campus, grasping the attention of many Emory community members. Racist Ties The $90 million militarized police training base will clear 85 acres of land in one of Atlanta’s largest green spaces, the Weelaunee Forest. Construction will include a mock city structure for practicing urban defense tactics and areas designated for testing explosives that reinforce the racist legacy of policing in America. Atlanta’s population is approximately 48% Black, yet between 2013 and 2023, 90% of people killed by the Atlanta Police Department (APD) were Black, according to the Mapping Police Violence database. History has taught us that Cop City will empower even more systemic violence. The construction of Cop City is also inextricably linked to the environmental racism that it will perpetuate. The destruction of the Weelaunee Forest would have devastating effects on Atlanta’s climate, obliterating a forest known as one of the city’s “four lungs.” The Weelaunee Forest preserves air quality and prevents flooding from harming nearby predominantly Black communities. In these neighborhoods, asthma rates are among the highest in the nation, ranking in the 94th percentile, and surrounding waterways rank in the 96th percentile for toxic water pollution levels, according to the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool. Evidently, the destruction of this valuable green space is directly tied to harming the collective health of largely low-income, Black communities. Cop City Sparks Student Protests Learning from the city begins with understanding and fighting to dismantle Atlanta’s legacy of racist policing. Emory Stop Cop City is a student-led organization that aims to prevent the construction of the facility. The coalition has been organizing events, planning rallies and creating space for discourse since the fall 2022 semester. On April 24, the organization hosted a gathering on the Emory Quad to facilitate community building through sharing art, music and food. The event evolved into a vigil for Manuel “Tortuguita” Terán, a forest defender who was shot by police 57 times when APD raided an encampment in the Weelaunee Forest. In response, students resolved to camp out on the Quad to demand the University condemn militarized police violence and the institution of Cop City. However, when protestors ignored threats of code of conduct violations, Emory Police Department (EPD) officers arrived on the Quad and threatened arrest if the students did not leave the area. Armed APD officers stood on the periphery of the Quad to “provide support to EPD, if needed,” Assistant Vice President of University Communications Laura Diamond wrote. It is one matter to be apolitical or uninterested in activism-related organizing. However, it is a separate issue, one lacking moral responsibility, to fail to understand the severity of Emory calling armed police officers on their own students without warning. The University’s administration should be fundamentally built on representing and addressing the needs, goals and collective character of the student body. But when the EPD decided to send armed APD members to a non-violent protest, the University made a statement on its complicity in the construction of Cop City and its lack of moral responsibility toward its students. Emory made it clear that they deem it permissible to respond to peaceful civic engagement with threats of violence. As members of the Emory community, all students have a civic duty to hold the administration accountable. Every Emory student should envision their calls for change being met with tens of officers, wielding weapons, in the middle of our campus hub, in the dead of the night — and they should be just as angry as if this happened yesterday. Soph Guerieri/Staff Photographer; Tiffany Namkung/Social Editor The PATH Foundation Similar to Cop City, the partnership between Emory and Atlanta’s PATH Foundation received a wave of opposition from a multitude of student groups and faculty signatories upon inception. Initially presented by Emory’s Office of Master Planning in November 2022, the proposal described a multi-use trail to potentially be built through parts of Emory’s property, including in Lullwater Preserve and Wesley Woods. Their stated goals included allowing for increased bike and pedestrian commuter access to campus. The recreational path would, however, also threaten fragile ecosystems inhabited by endangered species. A coalition of organizations released a joint statement on Feb. 25 opposing the potential path with signatures from students, staff, alumni, faculty and community members. Several months have now passed, and in a written statement to the Wheel, Diamond said that “PATH is conducting a feasibility study at the request of DeKalb County and no decisions about the project have been made.” There are no decisions on the PATH Foundation and zero mentions of Cop City by Fenves. Emory has not just failed to take a stance; it has consistently refused to address valid student concerns. Present Polarization at Emory Tensions over Cop City rose again on Oct. 25 with an on-campus rally decrying the University’s financial ties. After a planned walkout, about 40 protestors entered Convocation Hall to present an updated list of 12 demands to Emory’s Director of Presidential Initiatives and Special Projects Anjulet Tucker. Protestors also condemned the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine, chanting the controversial phrase, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” and advocating for the University to “issue a statement in support of Palestine,” and “protect students from being doxxed.” Fenves later sent an email to students, faculty, parents and alumni, denouncing “antisemitic phrases and slogans … repeatedly used by speakers and chanted by the crowd.” While Fenves was quick to call for students to seek “understanding over division,” he failed to explain what exactly constituted antisemitism or even mention Cop City — the original purpose of the protest. No email Fenves will send will ever be perfect; the responsibility to represent an entire student body is nearly impossible when considering such contentious issues. But Emory University, where “the wise heart seeks knowledge,” has the ability to foster and encourage dialogue. When Fenves sent this email without advocating for productive civic discourse, he fostered an incendiary environment that further divided students and put others at physical risk. Institutional statements are powerful in both benevolent and malevolent ways. Countless students currently feel hurt, angry and unsafe on campus. There is value in using empathy to engage with such nuanced political issues — reflecting on varied intentions, interpretations and identities. If Fenves had been more clear in his email about the protest, acknowledged why students gathered and encouraged a commitment for both sides to actively and empathetically learn from the other, there would be less polarization on campus. Debate Over Respect for Open Expression Policy Emory’s Respect for Open Expression Policy, which was implemented in 2013, affirms students’ rights to voice a wide variety of opinions. Although the policy protects freedom of expression, many organizations have also criticized the policy for permitting hate speech against marginalized students and providing exceptionally ambiguous guidelines on why a protest should be shut down. The Emory Social Justice Coalition called for expansion of the policy in 2020. The coalition stressed the power of the Chair of the Committee for Open Expression to terminate student protests and demanded that the University include more individuals in the process of determining when termination is necessary. The provision was not made. Debate over the policy was reignited on Oct. 21 when Professor of History and Director of Graduate Admissions Clifton Crais criticized Emory’s response to April’s Cop City protests. Crais wrote that the policy “is less a document that defends free speech and protest as a policy that attempts to police speech and protest.” Crais is correct. The demonstrations against Cop City in April employed an Open Expression Observer, yet the students present were not notified of the plan to send EPD and armed APD officers in retaliation. In fact, student Oren Panovka (25C), who was present in the early hours of April 25, said that Stop Cop City organizers explicitly asked the Open Expression Observer to communicate their desire for APD and weaponry to not be implicated in the administration’s response. These requests were blatantly ignored, emphasizing the administration’s commitment to the performative upkeep of fostering advocacy on campus. Jack Rutherford/Staff Photographer Good, Necessary Trouble at Emory “Emory is a place where we discuss and debate the issues that divide us — this is a foundational aspect of our mission to educate,” Diamond wrote in a University statement to the Wheel. While the University has expressed its encouragement of student discourse, it is evident that Emory is inept at supporting the true passion for advocacy displayed by much of its community. What is even more alarming is that the University has repeatedly displayed tendencies to intentionally stifle student activism by condemning protests and disregarding critical debate. Emory’s website states that “Atlanta is progress — always driving forward in the face of social justice and civil rights.” This is correct, and promoting the University’s “synergistic” connection to Atlanta must include first recognizing Atlanta’s history as a city that has always flourished because of its young people — individuals who elected to engage in what former U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) deemed “good trouble, necessary trouble.” The reality is that Emory is not just an Atlanta academic powerhouse. The University is also one of the largest employers in the metropolitan area and therefore has a profound influence over the region. The administration’s use of law enforcement to intercept peaceful protests fundamentally contradicts Emory’s mission to “create, preserve, teach, and apply knowledge in the service of humanity,” and its subsequent silence comes from a place of immense privilege. “A democracy cannot thrive where power remains unchecked and justice is reserved for a select few,” Lewis said in regard to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. If Emory is truly “a community of impact where the greater good is balanced with individual interest,” the individual interests of the administration must not continuously overshadow its students’ views. It is difficult to grapple with criticizing the University’s response and consequently being tasked to consider what an ideal response looks like. This is subjective to individual issues, but the acknowledgment and the prioritization of student safety should be the foremost priority. Whether it be sending armed cops to suppress a student protest or failing to address the ostracization and targeting of students involved in the Oct. 25 protest, Emory administration is consistently contradicting its baseline commitment to student activism. Simply put, activism should not be institutionalized. Emory emphasizes advocacy as intrinsic to the institution, and therefore, the student body. Yet, our institution repeatedly stifles student perspectives and undermines civic discourse on campus, continuing to capitalize on the facade of encouraging student advocacy. Emory’s activism is reduced to a website tagline rather than tangible action; whether it be in the context of giving back to Atlanta or engaging with issues one cares about on campus, Emory, as a private institution, has and will primarily prioritize self-focused interests. Emory students, who support issues across different perspectives, can come together in the powerful realization that their activism is an individual identity, independent from Emory. We often hear of the “Emory bubble,” a phenomenon in which Emory students seldom leave campus and integrate into the city beyond, resulting in an affluent but isolated institution entirely segregated from reality. Breaking this bubble is virtually unattainable without a campus cultural shift. Emory students need to continue to advocate for environmental protection, for marginalized communities and for a safer future. When the administration continually falls short, we are the ones continuously working to empower our community and redefine advocacy. We are only made better by divesting from the University’s commodification of our activism. Correction (12/6/2023 at 2:51 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Emory Police Department (EPD) and Atlanta Police Department (APD) officers “stormed” the Quadrangle. The article has been updated to clarify that APD stood on the perimeter of the Quad while EPD officers asked protestors to comply with requests to leave the Quad or face arrest.

Police subdued the man, a 25-year-old French citizen who had spent four years in prison for planning a violent offense. After his arrest, he expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. The attacker apparently cried “Allahu Akbar” (God is great), Darmanin added. “This person was ready to kill others,” Darmanin told reporters.

The attacker, who was not identified by name, left prison after four years in 2020 and was under surveillance and undergoing psychiatric treatment, the minister said, painting a brief portrait of the assailant, who was born in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, a Paris suburb. He was most recently living with his parents in the Essonne region, south of Paris. The fatal attack occurred in the 15th district of the French capital with the assailant using a knife to kill the German tourist, who was not identified. He then crossed the Seine river to the Right Bank and used a hammer to attack the injured. Details about the victims were not immediately known. U.S. & World News from around the country and around the globe The attacker was stopped by police who twice fired a taser at him in the stomach, the minister said, praising the officers for their quick response and reiterating that “there would doubtless have been other dead.” France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia's Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That fatal attack came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The Saturday attack raised the fear level in the French capital, still marked by the 2015 attacks of cafes and a music hall by Islamist radicals that killed 130 people. “We will cede nothing in the face of terrorism. Never,” Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said on X, formerly Twitter, sending her condolences to the victims and their families."

Several Elk Grove Village police officers confronted Murray in a yard near the Murray family home on Fern Drive Friday afternoon, the Tribune reported. A neighbor had called police to report a man leaving a house holding a knife. Someone inside the house had previously called the police, Deputy Chief of Police Christopher Torres told the Tribune Friday. Murray was still holding the knife as a confrontation ensued, Torres said. An Elk Grove Village police officer shot Murray around 4:30 p.m. Murray was pronounced dead at Alexian Brothers Hospital Friday night. The Murray family declined to comment Saturday morning. Murray’s parents have hired attorney Antonio Romanucci of Romanucci & Blandin, a Chicago personal injury law firm, to represent them in any legal recourse against Elk Grove Village police. Murray’s parents were not allowed back inside their home for upward of five hours after the shooting, a representative for Romanucci & Blandin said. “We hope to cooperate with the Elk Grove Village police to determine exactly what happened during this tragic incident,” spokeswoman Jennifer McGuffin told the Tribune. Torres had said that Murray also lived in Elk Grove Village, but he also kept an address in Edgewater, according to the medical examiner’s office. Three Elk Grove police officers were sent to Alexian Brothers hospital Friday for observation and have been placed on administrative duties, the Tribune previously reported. The officer who shot Murray has not yet been identified."

Oswald has been placed on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a review of the incident. The man who was shot has not been identified. He was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in unknown condition. The incident started around 3:35 p.m., and officers responded near Nellis Boulevard and Cheyenne Avenue after reports of a man with a gun in a confrontation with another person, according to Metropolitan Capt. Joshua Martinez. Police said the man stole a tow truck and a police helicopter followed the truck until it reached the 5700 block of Baffy Circle, near Sloan Lane and Sahara Avenue. The man barricaded inside a home causing SWAT officers to respond. “The suspect fled out of the garage on a motorcycle (and) armed with a firearm,” Martinez said. Officers used low lethal weapons to knock the man off the motorcycle, Martinez said, but he continued running with the gun and pointed it at officers. An officer fired at the man, who was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. No officers were injured. Metro has investigated eight police shootings and nine total instances of officers deploying deadly force this year. Contact Marvin Clemons at mclemons@reviewjournal.com.

The lawsuit, brought by lawyers representing the family, seems to reveal details that were not part of the initial story told by police. According to court documents, Derrick Clark, the man who was shot and killed, was allegedly left lying on the ground for two hours after the incident, while numerous nearby officers failed to provide aid. The lawsuit alleges that: âRather than provide Mr. Clark with medical care, the law enforcement officers proceeded to laugh, make jokes, refer to Mr. Clark as an animal and a boy, launch explosives at his motionless body, and released a police dog to bite his body.â The attorneys behind the lawsuit have announced their partnership with civil rights attorney Ben Crump, known for his involvement in high-profile cases such as Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown, and George Floyd. A spokesperson for the Oregon State Police said they are aware of the pending litigation, and âOSP doesnât make comment during active lawsuits.â FOX 12 also reached out to the Clackamas County Sheriffâs Office for comment on the lawsuit but has not received a response. The FOX 12 Investigates team also spoke with Derrickâs aunt, who expressed devastation. Until recently, Derrickâs family had been leading the investigation, but it is now being taken over by prominent attorneys. Meanwhile, the family says it feels like they havenât been able to grieve. The details in the lawsuit are a result of an outside investigation done in part by the family itself as well as professionals hired by their attorneys. The story the lawsuit paints is very different from the one they were first told. âWe feel lied to and betrayed by the police,â said Carrie Miles, Clarkâs aunt on his motherâs side. âWe feel like we havenât been able to morn because we have had to fight for information every step of the way.â With the holidays fast approaching, the grief is even more acute. âDerek was the light in our family. He was that one, that everyone waited for to come over,â said Miles. âThereâs nothing quite like having to set an empty place at the holiday table. We are devastated, absolutely devastated.â PREVIOUS COVERAGE: In November 2022, a grand jury determined the use of deadly force by a Clackamas County detective and Oregon State Police trooper during a traffic stop in Milwaukie on June 18 was justified. The incident began on the evening of June 18, 2022, when Trooper Zachary Cole and Detective Daniel Ferguson were driving their patrol vehicles when each attempted to pull over 24-year-old Derrick Dewayne Clark for suspicion of driving under the influence of intoxicants. Clark fled the attempted traffic stop at a high speed and ended up crashing his vehicle into a ditch, according to court documents. The DOJ said Ferguson and Cole gave Clark verbal instructions to show his hands but he did not comply. The lawsuit also alleges that the high-speed chase was against department policy and that the deputyâs supervisor told him over the radio to stop pursuing. Clark then got out of his vehicle with a firearm in his right hand and took off running. According to the DOJ, Clark raised the weapon in the air at one point and both Ferguson and Cole fired multiple shots at him. Clark was hit twice and died at the scene. After a thorough investigation, an assistant attorney general presented the case to a Clackamas County Grand Jury. The grand jury returned a ânot true billâ Monday night, meaning the grand jury believed criminal charges against the two law enforcement officers were not warranted.

At some schools, even if they go to the bathroom, they must be accompanied by an adult. The Oklahoma schools‚Äô rules were implemented after a 16-year-old student was shot to death at the first home game of the season for the Choctaw High School Yellowjackets. The victim, who was not a student at either team‚Äôs school, was allegedly killed following an argument he had had with another teen. In other words, this was not what we think of as a school shooting, except that it was on school property. In the ensuing panic, fans ran for safety and an off-duty officer shot a 42-year-old in the chest. A 15-year-old girl was also shot. There were seven on-duty police officers at the game for security purposes, NBC reports. The new safety rules that went into effect in at least four Oklahoma school districts include requiring all students at high school football games to wear their school ID on a lanyard. Attendees must also sit on their own team‚Äôs side. The rules at the Moore Public Schools ‚ÄĒ part of the Oklahoma City metro area ‚ÄĒ state that: ‚ÄúJunior High and elementary students must have a parent/guardian present for the duration of the event, and they must remain with the parent/ guardian, including (during) restroom and concession breaks.‚ÄĚ Students attending Mustang Public Schools cannot mill about, either. ‚ÄúLoitering will not be tolerated,‚ÄĚ according to the rules. ‚ÄúStudents/children are to sit in the stands and shall not congregate under the stands or in other areas of the sporting complex.‚ÄĚ Erin Henriques ‚ÄĒ who is my colleague at Let Grow, the nonprofit I co-founded ‚ÄĒ tells me that these kinds of restrictions have become commonplace. ‚ÄúSince I don‚Äôt have kids in school anymore, I‚Äôm not sure how others feel about it,‚ÄĚ writes Ms. Henriques, who lives at Mustang, Oklahoma. ‚ÄúBut my understanding is that everyone has gotten so used to privileges being taken away because of violence that it is just something they now have to abide by for safety, whether it is practical.‚ÄĚ In her town, Ms. Henriques said, middle school students invited to homecoming come to the high school football games proudly wearing a corsage ‚ÄĒ on him ‚ÄĒ and a knee-length sash of matching flowers ‚ÄĒ on her. It is thrilling for them to walk through the stands together, showing off their ‚Äúhomecoming mums.‚ÄĚ Now they must be accompanied by their mom or dad. In the aftermath of a football game shooting, it‚Äôs not surprising that some security changes would immediately be put in place ‚ÄĒ whether or not they do any good. Yet similar rules were recently adopted at Sheldon High School at Springfield, Oregon, where I can find no report of any recent incidents. The rules there state that elementary and middle school students must be supervised by a parent or a ‚Äúresponsible adult‚ÄĚ at Friday night football games. The local ABC affiliate reports that Sheldon High School‚Äôs athletic director said, ‚Äúthe changes are to provide a safer and more predictable environment for everyone in attendance by ensuring younger fans have the guidance and support to enjoy games responsibly.‚ÄĚ Do children really need ‚Äúguidance‚ÄĚ at a football game? Are they not able to figure out anything by themselves? ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm a 14-year-old and I have to have a parent go with me to the bathroom at a game?‚ÄĚ Ms. Henriques said. ‚ÄúTalk about taking away a child‚Äôs independence and instilling fear.‚ÄĚ It‚Äôs as American as apple pie ‚ÄĒ and football.

Police said shortly before 4:30 p.m. they were called to a home in the 200-block of Fern about an armed man. When they arrived, a man left the home with a knife in hand. The man confronted officers outside in a nearby yard, and during the confrontation police opened fire on him. He was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Three officers were also taken to the hospital for observation, police said. Police said they had received the 911 call that brought them to the home by the resident, and had been called to the home in the past, but they did not say whether the resident and the suspect had any relationship with each other or whether the man who was shot lived at the home. Police said the man is believed to be a resident of Elk Grove Village. Neighbors were shaken by the incident. ""This is an area where people, they do, they stay. They stay a long time. They raise their kids here, and then sometimes their kids buy homes here, and so it's that kind of neighborhood,"" said resident Barb Labellarte. Elk Grove Village police are conducting a criminal investigation into the incident but said there is no danger to the public. The Major Case Assistance Team is investigating the shooting."

Police subdued the man, a 25-year-old French citizen who had spent four years in prison for planning a violent offense. After his arrest, he expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. The attacker apparently cried ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great), Darmanin added. ""This person was ready to kill others,"" Darmanin told reporters. The anti-terrorism prosecutor's office confirmed it has opened an investigation. The attacker went after a German couple with a knife, killing the man and used a hammer to injure two others. The attacker, who was not identified by name, left prison after four years in 2020 and was under surveillance and undergoing psychiatric treatment, the minister said, painting a brief portrait of the assailant, who was born in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, a Paris suburb. He was most recently living with his parents in the Essonne region, south of Paris. The fatal attack occurred in the 15th district of the French capital with the assailant using a knife to kill the German tourist, who was not identified. He then crossed the Seine river to the Right Bank and used a hammer to attack the injured. Details about the victims were not immediately known. The attacker was stopped by police who twice fired a taser at him in the stomach, the minister said, praising the officers for their quick response and reiterating that ""there would doubtless have been other dead. France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia's Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That fatal attack came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The Saturday attack raised the fear level in the French capital, still marked by the 2015 attacks of cafes and a music hall by Islamist radicals that killed 130 people. ""We will cede nothing in the face of terrorism. Never,"" Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said on X, formerly Twitter, sending her condolences to the victims and their families."

The town’s poets are gathered, as they have done every single week since 1989. Kai Coggin, Wednesday Night Poetry’s fearless leader, weaves through the crowd, greeting old friends and newcomers alike with a dazzling smile and a hug. When she addresses the room, the rules are clear: This is a safe space. “There won’t be any racism, no homophobia, no transphobia,” Coggin says. “And no arachnophobia. Spiders are our friends.” For the next three hours, people share poems in memoriam and in celebration. They speak of perfect days and sleepless nights. Haikus, limericks, sonnets. Songs and prayers. The sting of the outside world’s assorted calamities becomes more bearable, if just for a little while. Such is the ritual of the nation’s longest-running consecutive weekly open mic poetry night. Coggin — poet, teacher and master naturalist — has led the group since 2019. Since moving to Arkansas over a decade ago, she’s established herself as a literary force. The 43-year-old has four published poetry collections, with a fifth on the way, and she’s taught poetry to K-12 students across the state via the Arkansas Arts Council and Arkansas Learning Through the Arts. For these accomplishments, she holds the title of Hot Springs’ inaugural poet laureate, two Arkansas Times “Best Poet” designations and, most recently, the Don Munro Leadership in the Arts Award, which she received in late October. Back during her turbulent teenage years, when poetry was a solitary comfort while she came to terms with her queerness, Coggin made a vow. “My soul made a promise,” Coggin said. “If I made it through, I’d hold space for others.” Now she cultivates community wherever she goes. Initially, that promise led her to teaching in Houston, where she grew up. While teaching high school English, Coggin founded the district’s first gay-straight alliance. “It was hard to be the figurehead leading that, and there was opposition — but I’ve always pushed against opposition.” Coggin said the benefits of helping the kids far outweighed any risks to her. She wanted a place where the “outcasts” could come and be themselves, free of judgment. “Allowing safety, even if it’s just one person you can be yourself around, that is lifesaving.” After teaching for five years, she decided to pursue writing full time. Coggin and her wife moved to Hot Springs in 2012, and it was then that she first stumbled upon Wednesday Night Poetry. From the first night she went, Coggin was transfixed. “I started writing something new every week because I knew there’d be someone there to hear it,” Coggin said. Those weekly poems became enough for a book, and after winning a publishing contest, her first poetry collection, “Periscope Heart,” was born in 2014. “I wouldn’t have taken those chances had I not had this community.” Her writing began as inward exploration. In “Constant Before Picture,” for example, she examines body image: “I am a swirling galaxy in human form, / cut me cross section and see the concentric circles of my orbits.” She also wrote about identity — Coggin is Filipino-American and was born in Thailand — and the trauma of moving away from her birthplace as a young girl. “When Bangkok was ripped / out of my seven-year-old hands / and my father went away with my country, / I dropped all my memories out of a tiny hatch / in the airplane headed for America,” she says in “กรงเทพมหานคร Bangkok.” As she grew more and more aware of the world’s volatility, however, the poems evolved to be political and defiant. As a queer woman of color in a red Southern state, Coggin writes in a political landscape frequently hostile to her own identity — but that’s not a deterrent. When shit gets scary, her pen is her sword. “Speaking up and holding light in the face of darkness, it became my purpose. This is why I’m here,” she said. She wrote about school shootings, about Black boys being killed by police, about Trump’s presidency. “It was my way of making a mark in the literary canon, that someone was mad about these things. Someone was not going to be silent.” After the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, Coggin wrote a poem in honor of “the 49 queer bodies that were massacred in a nightclub when they just wanted to dance.” She shared it the next Wednesday night. “It wasn’t just me crying for those 49 souls, it was everyone there.” Coggin firmly believes in the power of art to facilitate change, and her lamentations tend to come coupled with a call to action, as illustrated by a poem from her third collection called “Where Are The Warriors?”: “put your warrior fist in the air, / leave it there / but take your other fist and open it, / set your four fingers and thumb stretch outward with light / to the corners of our country / covered in heavy shadows.” Wednesday Night Poetry has served as a constant reminder that many other artists are taking a stand through their work. “We’re not isolated blue flames in a red state — there are many of us that want a better world,” Coggin said. Coggin first met Bud Kenny — much beloved author, adventurer and the founder of Wednesday Night Poetry — when he returned for its 25th anniversary. Initially, she thought, “who’s this dude in a top hat?” But they forged a fast friendship, what Coggin calls a father-daughter poetry family. On a Wednesday night in 2019, Kenny knelt down on one knee and offered Coggin his clipboard. He wanted to sit back and relax, and asked if she’d carry their group into the future. Coggin became the new host in February 2019, and that October, Kenny had a heart attack. It was a Wednesday when he died, and Coggin had to go to poetry night to tell their community he was gone. Six months later, COVID-19 set in and everyone was under lockdown. “I wasn’t going to let this legacy fail when it’s in my hands. Oh hell no,” Coggin said. There was a streak to continue, so she put out a call to Arkansas poets and uploaded videos to Facebook of them reading their work. What usually stayed within the confines of a little coffee shop became a worldwide community of poets. Through the 100 weeks of pandemic, 5,000 people from six continents sent in their work. Folks who’d never written a poem in their life shared their first writing alongside literary giants like Ada Limón and Jane Hirshfield. Though Coggin hosts the poetry readings in person now, the second Wednesday of every month is also live-streamed. “All this time, Wednesday Night Poetry has been an anchor,” Coggin said. “A place to be in community, but also to make that community something global.” Knowing how poetry can be a survival tool, Coggin wanted to share it with the kids of Arkansas. Since 2015, she’s taught poetry workshops to thousands of students around the state, a feat for which she won the 2021 Governor’s Arts Award. The priority when she goes into the classroom is always building trust. “There are a lot of kids that have never had a safe space to just feel — they can’t talk about their feelings in math class or history or on the playground, but they could put it in a poem,” Coggin said. “Even if they never show it to anybody. It’s like they don’t have to carry it around on their shoulders anymore.” It’s fraught, though, to teach such novel concepts as empathy these days. People might get suspicious. In May this year, shortly after the LEARNS Act was introduced, Coggin was invited to teach a workshop to fourth-graders. She read selections from “Can I Touch Your Hair? Poems of Race, Mistakes and Friendship” by Irene Latham and Charles Waters and “The Same Inside: Poems about Empathy and Friendship” by Liz Brownlee, Matt Goodfellow and Roger Stevens; shared her experience as an immigrant; and then asked the kids to write and read their own poems in response. After two days, the school sent Coggin home. Two parents had called to complain that she was indoctrinating their kids with woke ideology. (Coggin declined to share at which school the incident occurred.) “I was crying in the principal’s office because I told [the kids] they were safe with me, I told them they could write anything, and then it looked like I didn’t show up. “The adults wage their culture wars,” Coggin said, “but it’s the children who suffer.” The May incident, heartbreaking as it was, seemed a clear sign that a realignment of energy was due. She’s taking a step back from teaching, just for now, and leaning into rest and inspiration. Her fifth book, “Mother of Other Kingdoms,” which she hopes will be published in the spring, takes great notice of the natural world. It’s an exploration of resistance in a new form: fighting apathy by illuminating the things which bring us joy. This shift is embodied by “I Sit with a Master,” a poem in the Spring 2023 issue of Blue Heron Review that will be included in her forthcoming collection. “All of my eyes are open,” she muses. “I try to catch all the images moving / like salmon in a stream before me, / try to hold them slippery and fleeting / in an act of poetic preservation.” When I visited Kollective Coffee + Tea in the summer, Coggin read one of her own poems after everyone else had spoken. She’d written it that day, she said, and was met with an enthusiastic “New shit!” from the crowd. She explained it was written in mourning for an onslaught of regressive attacks from the Arkansas legislature. “How do we fight against a darkening world?” Coggin said. “I’m asking! How?” The coffee shop was quiet, but one small voice from the crowd answered with confidence: “Love!” Percy Shelley (Romantic, rapscallion) once wrote that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. Two hundred years later, the sentiment still rings true. Considering our actual, acknowledged legislators haven’t done such a bang-up job as of late, maybe it’s time the poets step in."

IMPD was sent to a “call for help” involving a hostage situation about 7:20 p.m. Thursday at McDonald’s, 4941 Knights Way. That’s in an area with restaurants, hotels and truck stops just southwest of the interchange for I-69 and I-465. Medics were called to the scene for a person shot just before 7:45 p.m. Thursday. Lt. Shane Foley of IMPD says officers arrived to learn of a disturbance inside the semitruck and then forced their way into the cabin. The officers saw what appeared to be a hostage situation, Foley says. Assistant Chief Chris Bailey described what happened during an impromptu news conference about 10:30 p.m. that aired live on News 8. He talked about a lieutenant who moved into the cab to try to talk to the driver before the fatal shooting. “Tonight, this officer saved a woman’s life,” he said. Officers arrived and spoke with the 911 caller, who pointed out the semitruck. They knocked on the door and saw the driver come from behind a curtain that separates the driving compartment from the sleeping compartment. Police tried to talk to the driver, who briefly sat in the driver’s seat before returning back to the sleeping compartment. “That’s when the officers heard themselves a female scream from the back of that truck,” Bailey said. Officers sat up around the semitruck and made announcements. Eventually, police decided to break out the driver’s-side window to better see into and hear from the cab. In addition to the curtain separating the compartments, a curtain also was over the driver’s-side window. Bailey said, “The lieutenant at one point opened the door and began communicating with the male inside … the truck. The lieutenant asked the individual to identify himself. The lieutenant identified himself by first name. He was attempting to build a rapport with this individual. This individual kept saying he had a knife to the woman’s throat. All the while, the woman could be heard screaming that she was bleeding and needed help. This went on for a few minutes. “The lieutenant, in my opinion, bravely inched into the car on multiple occasions to move the curtain back so he could see and continue to try to communicate with the individual inside the cab.” IMPD later reported that the driver told officers multiple statements, including âIâm going to kill her,” âI got a knife to her throat,â and âYouâre gonna die.â Eventually, the lieutenant got inside the semitruck and gave the driver orders again. “You can briefly see, on the bodycam, the individual on top of the woman in back of the car. A shot was fired by the officer. The suspect was deceased inside the cab of the truck,” Bailey said. The assistant chief says other officers then came and freed the woman from the semitruck. Officers were seeking other witnesses at the scene in addition to the 911 caller. IMPD about 8:45 p.m. Thursday was awaiting warrants to search the semitruck, but the investigators were inside the semitruck by 10:30 p.m. An IMPD news release issued about 11:20 p.m. said a razor blade with blood was found in the sleeping cabin. Multiple officers were equipped with body-worn cameras, which were activated.â¯ As is standard procedure, investigations will look into what happened and the police procedures used. The lieutenant will be placed on administrative leave. Bailey says other officers on the scene also may receive time off to process what happened. The police shooting was the 17th in 2023. It’s the most police shootings since 20 were recorded in 2015. Police generally release the names of officers in the shootings about a week after they happen. Bodycam footage is usually shared a few weeks later. Earlier this month, IMPD revealed it’s reached out to the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum to submit a bid to conduct a study on what’s causing so many police shooting to happen. However, that process has yet to come to fruition, Bailey said Thursday night. After another police shooting, IMPD Deputy Chief Kendale Adams spoke at an August event, where he acknowledged the need for a larger conversation about what it looks like to deal with mental health, disputes, and trauma.

The Eureka Police Department has identified the man killed by officers in a shooting Sunday as Matthew Robert Williams, 31, of Cutten. EPD issued a press release this afternoon, offering a bit more detail on the shooting that followed a traffic stop at about 9:35 a.m. Sunday, leaving Williams dead and two officers on administrative leave. According to EPD, the incident began when an officers pulled over a vehicle on M Street, north of Second Street, for having an expired registration tag. When the vehicle stopped, Williams, the right front passenger, got out and fled on foot, according to the release, which details that he ran east on a walkway north of the Ingomar Club toward the north side of the Humboldt County Library. According to the release, the officer who had pulled the vehicle over did not pursue Williams, instead staying with the car and its two occupants as nearby officers responded to search the area for the fleeing man. âAn officer located the male as he was attempting to scale a fence to the north side of the Clara Mayberry Park, which was closed,â the release states, adding that the officer gave Williams commands to stop. âHowever, the male refused to comply and a physical altercation ensued.â The release states that as a second officer arrived to assist, Williams allegedly pulled a pistol, which he held with his right hand, and at some point chambered a round. âAt this point during the alteration, shots were fired by officers and the male was struck by the gunfire,â the release states. âItâs unknown at this time if the male fired his handgun during the alteration.â Williams was pronounced dead at the scene and an autopsy has been scheduled. click to enlarge - HCSO - A booking photo from Williams' July 25 arrest. After the shooting, the officer whoâd initiated the traffic stop left the vehicle to help the officers whoâd been involved in the alleged altercation with and shooting of Williams. At that point, the two occupants of the vehicle left the area. They and the car were later tracked down, with the occupants interviewed and the car seized as evidence. According to the release, two officers fired shots at Williams â one with more than seven yearsâ of experience in law enforcement, the other with more than four yearsâ experience. The release states both were minorly injured in the alteration and have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, per departmental protocol. The firearm recovered from Williams was a ghost gun, according to EPD, meaning it does not have a serial number. Additionally, the release alleges he was found to be in possession of 42 grams of fentanyl and a âlarge amount of cash.â According to EPD, one of the officers who fired their weapon during the exchange was wearing a body camera that captured video of the incident, while the other officerâs camera âsuffered a malfunction and did not capture the incident.â According to media reports, Williams has a history of arrests in Humboldt County, primarily for drug offenses. He was most recently arrested July 25 by agents with the Humboldt County Drug Task Force on suspicion of drug possession, resisting a peace officer, violation of the terms of his probation and possessing burglary tools. The timing and circumstances of his release from jail are unclear, though the Journal has inquired and will report any response we receive. The shooting remains under investigation by the Humboldt County Critical Incident Response Team, with the investigation being co-led by the Humboldt County District Attorneyâs Office and EPD. Meanwhile, a parallel administrative investigation is also being conducted and its findings will be reviewed by the cityâs independent police auditor, who will report to the cityâs Community Oversight on Police Practices Board.

This week’s slaying of Michael Latt sent shockwaves through Hollywood as the suspect faces charges of murder and burglary. Latt, 33, had worked on projects with filmmakers including Ryan Coogler and Ava DuVernay, as well as rap artist Common. He was pronounced dead Monday at a hospital. Prosecutors allege that Jameelah Elena Michl, 36, knocked on his home’s door and forced herself inside once it was open. She had sought out Latt’s home âafter she targeted him for being friends with a woman she had been stalking,â the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said in a news release Thursday. She allegedly fired at him with a semi-automatic handgun. The suspect previously had a restraining order filed against her by a friend of Latt’s, film director A.V. Rockwell, who said in court filings that Michl worked as an extra in one of her films, âA Thousand And One.â After production concluded, Michl began to stalk Rockwell, the director claimed in a June application for the order. Rockwell said after she did not respond to Michl’s overtures for a personal relationship, the woman hand-delivered alarming letters to the directorâs home threatening self-harm. âMy Glock is loaded as I write this,â Michl wrote in one letter, according to the court filings. âOne pull of the trigger and Iâll be free.â Rockwell was not at Lattâs house when he was shot, authorities said. Michl’s arraignment in the killing was continued to Dec. 15, so she has not yet entered a plea, and prosecutors are seeking $3 million bail. If convicted, she could face a sentence of life in prison. Michl will be represented by a public defender, though one had not yet been assigned to her case, the public defenderâs office said. Detectives seized Michl’s vehicle, which she had been living in, as evidence. She stayed at the scene and was taken into custody. In January, Latt and Rockwell both attended the Sundance Film Festival, where Rockwell’s movie won the Grand Jury Prize. Latt posted a photo with Rockwell on Instagram with the caption, âCongratulations to @AVRockwell on your incredible feature film directorial debut, A Thousand and One.â Michl sent âat least 5 extremely long and threatening emails and text messages,â repeatedly called Rockwell’s cell phone and approached the director at public events, the documents show. âAs you continue to bask in the glory of âA Thousand and One,â l want you to remember, and not forget all the hell that people went through to help bring your masterpiece to the screen,â Michl wrote in an April 29 email. On May 3, Michl wrote again, threatening suicide. âIâm taking my Glock into Griffith Park and not coming out,â she wrote in an email. Rockwell got the restraining order reissued on numerous occasions, according to court documents. A representative for Rockwell did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment from the director. Latt’s marketing firm, Lead with Love, focused on social impact, and he was inspired to start the business after working on Cooglerâs film âFruitvale Station,â about the 2009 fatal police shooting of Oscar Grant in Oakland, California, that starred Michael B. Jordan, and wanted to direct his efforts toward social justice movements. He was born into a show business family: His mother, Michelle Satter, is one of the founding directors of the Sundance Institute’s artists programs, where she has helped filmmakers such as Coogler and Quentin Tarantino early in their careers. His father, David Latt, is a film producer, and his brother is an agent. Latt had also worked at the Sundance Institute, which issued a statement on behalf of his family. âHe dedicated his career to serving others, employing storytelling, art, and various mediums to create enduring change and galvanizing communities with hope, love, and inspiration,â the statement said. âMichael will never be forgotten and his legacy and work will carry on through his family, his friends, and his colleagues.â Latt also worked with Common, on the Oscars campaign for the song âLetter to the Free,â and with DuVernay. Together, they launched a concert prison tour and helped developed Commonâs nonprofit Imagine Justice. âThe moment I realized that I could use my skill set for social good, I decided to dedicate the rest of my career to helping others, empowering storytellers of color, and fighting injustice wherever it stands,â Latt told Forbes in 2019. âThrough stories and art, we can showcase incarcerated and formerly incarcerated men and womenâs humanity, shine a light on injustices in the system and shift the narrative about how we talk about the issues.â Rockwell’s film â A Thousand and One,â starring Teyana Taylor as a single mother, won a Gotham Award on Monday night for breakthrough director. ___ Associated Press Film Writer Lindsey Bahr contributed.

Sources and a friend of the suspect told ABC13 that the man has been identified as Jonathan Yi, 45. Appraisal records list him as the homeowner of the residence in the 15400 block of Flemington Avenue. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the shooting happened in the front of the home and the man died in the front yard. In an afternoon press conference, Gonzalez said it all started when neighbors reported an abandoned vehicle in the middle of the road with its doors wide open at about 10:50 a.m. Friday. HCSO said when the first deputy arrived, he heard shots being fired inside the residence and called for additional units. ""They began hearing additional shots coming from inside the house, but this time, they were shooting out through a window towards our deputies,"" Gonzalez said. ""At that point, nobody had been hurt."" Deputies then reportedly set a perimeter and called their crisis negotiation team since Gonzalez said it involved a potential barricaded suspect. While deputies were securing the perimeter outside, officials said the suspect exited the home holding two rifles. That's when five deputies opened fire and hit the suspect. He was pronounced dead at the scene. WATCH: HCSO provides live update after suspect who fired at law enforcement was shot and killed by deputies While deputies were entering the house to check if anyone was inside or hurt, they noticed different wires laid out. ""There was evidence the house was booby trapped, which is a unique but dangerous element. Someone can go in and it could be catastrophic,"" Gonzalez said. Officers spent the next few hours clearing the house and making sure it was safe. No explosives were found. ""I want to say that we've had previous calls for services here at this location. Most have been related to either domestic disturbance type calls as well as other mental health related type calls,"" Gonzalez said. Yi was an Army veteran and a former Beaumont firefighter, ABC13 has learned. In 2020, the department requested a welfare check at the house because they had not heard from him. He was advised to call his commanding officer. ""That man was a wonderful person. He was a fireman after his military service. Just his PTSD got the best of him. We are vets and people don't understand what we vets go through,"" Yi's friend said to ABC13. Court records show he had an open warrant for narcotics after violating conditions of community supervision. No deputies were injured in the shooting, according to HCSO."

The Florida Supreme Court ruled a state law — known as Marsy’s Law — meant to protect crime victims, does not necessarily protect their name from public release. RELATED | Marsy’s Law doesn’t protect anyone’s name, including law enforcement, Florida Supreme Court rules Marsy’s Law entitled victims of crimes the right to prevent information from being released that “could be used to locate or harass the victim or the victim’s family,” but the Supreme Court ruled that does not guarantee “police officer or otherwise the categorical right to withhold his or her name from disclosure.” Since 2018, law enforcement has used this law to shield the names of officers involved in shootings, under the premise that they are victims. In Jacksonville, the sheriff’s office uses it to shield the names of crime victims who don’t opt out. For AJ Jordan, who works through his organization MAD DADS to try to get justice for murder victims, the ruling was a victory. “I think when you have a murder victim that’s an unknown, that’s a John Doe, the perpetrator feels like nobody cares, nobody’s looking,” Jordan said. MORE | Justices weigh police ‘Marsy’s Law’ case Bobby Block, executive director of the Florida First Amendment Foundation, said the move will remove a hindrance to accountability. “I think that Marsy’s Law became the shield, behind which many, many, many law enforcement departments hid to protect their personnel. And I’m not exactly sure what they were hiding their personnel from,” Block said. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office took action quickly. Its transparency page listing details of officer-involved shootings now includes a column listing the officers involved. The Florida Supreme Court’s order said information or records that could be used to locate or harass the victim or the victim’s family, do not encompass the victim’s identity."

Those in attendance may not have seen eye to eye with the DA on every topic, but they all agreed on one thing: LoDo is fighting a perception battle. âA lot of us who live and work in downtown are comfortable â 99 percent of the time, weâre comfortable,â resident David Roberts told Westword after the meeting. âNews people everywhere emphasize the negative, and that scares people. Weâll always be fighting that.â During the gathering, Roberts pointed out that even though those who frequent downtown find it safe, people who haven't been there simply donât believe them. He cited Downtown Denver Partnership statistics showing the overwhelming majority of people who go to businesses and places downtown live in suburban areas; Roberts said he hoped McCannâs work to combat crime this year would help make those visitors feel safe. McCann had positive news: As Westword chronicled earlier this year, crime was actually down around Union Station and in the Central Business District in 2023. She brought up Denver Police Department data to show that while crime rose dramatically in 2020, 2021 and 2022, itâs much lower now. Even motor vehicle theft, identified by police and legislators alike as one of the cityâs top problems, is down by 20 percent, according to McCannâs presentation. Despite the positive news, there are still concerns on the DAâs mind â like youth violence. âThat and fentanyl are the things that worry me, that keep me up at night,â McCann said. âThe cases we're seeing from the juvenile population are much more violent than they used to be. Lots of guns, lots of assaults, lots of shootings, even murders, and it's very concerning.â Sheâs encouraged by school resource officers making their return to select Denver Public Schools this year, and her office has other programs in schools designed to help get children interested in law enforcement and educate them about gun safety. Still, the DA has seen an uptick in gang membership among youths between the ages of fifteen and 25. âDo we have a gang problem? I would say yes,â McCann said. âWhen I was manager of safety, it was the Bloods and the Crips, and that was pretty much it. But now we have a lot.â In regard to the fentanyl crisis, McCann shared data showing the cases filed by her office related to the drug have âpretty much doubled every yearâ since 2019. They likely wonât double from 2022 to 2023, but they are trending to increase, she said. Methamphetamine is currently the second-most-abused drug in Denver, McCann added. In 2022, Colorado law changed to impose harsher penalties on those who distribute fentanyl and added a charge of distribution resulting in death. âUnfortunately, what we have found in trying to prosecute those cases is that most people who die of overdose have more than one drug in their system, so the coroner and medical examiner will not say definitively that fentanyl was the drug that killed the person,â McCann explained. âAt this point, we haven't been able to file that charge, but we can, on occasion, file a lesser charge. That's something that we're working on.â When asked what percentage of crime in the city is tied to drugs, McCann said that specific data is not kept, but that it is âquite a bit,"" and leads to crimes like theft, burglary and robbery. It is one of the most challenging issues facing the criminal justice system right now, she added. McCann isnât all negative, though. She said that she thinks the combination of courts working to connect people with resources for mental health and addiction, along with increased police efforts, is leading to the generally lower crime rates seen in Denver. [Mayor Mike] Johnston is really focusing on trying to get people off the street and into some kind of effective housing where they have wraparound services.â The district attorney says her officeâs restorative justice program, which focuses on alternatives to incarceration, has a recidivism rate of 2 percent, whereas jail has a recidivism rate of 50 percent. Additionally, McCann said that people experiencing homelessness are not those who tend to commit the serious crimes that really create a negative perception. Rather, they commit lower-level offenses like trespassing or urinating in public. âThe more serious crime is being generally committed by a different population, who have been committing crime for a while or have grown up around criminal behavior,â she explained. Audience members said they were particularly concerned about âofficer-involved shootings.â One such instance occurred on Monday, November 27, when police shot an armed man in the 800 block of Oneida Street. At the November 29 meeting, McCann said that she personally goes to the scenes of as many police shootings as she can. âI like to see what is going on,"" she said. ""Aligning where the body is when itâs still there, where all the evidence is in relation to each other, because ultimately I have to decide if we're going to file a criminal case against a police officer."" Along with the DAâs office, there is a multi-agency investigation for each incident and a departmental administrative procedure. McCann said that numerous factors are weighed in those probes, as they might be in the case of Jordan Waddy, whom police shot at under the suspicion that he had a gun â injuring six people outside Larimer Beer Hall, just a few blocks away from Tony Tenderonis, in July 2022. Officer Brandon Ramos was indicted on ten criminal charges for the incident, including second- and third-degree assault, negligence with a deadly weapon, prohibited use of a weapon, and reckless endangerment. A civil lawsuit filed by five people who were injured states that the odds the officer would hit the bystanders were âvirtually certain.â To help combat violence in the area and give it a better reputation, McCann encouraged residents to continue reporting crimes and to help law enforcement out by providing private security camera footage. She cited the case of Keanna Rosenburgh, a seventeen-year-old accused of shooting into a crowd and injuring five people after she was denied entry to Dierks Bentleyâs Whiskey Row, which is right across the street from Tony Tenderonis. She was on the loose for weeks after the September 16 incident, but is now in custody. âHow did we solve that? It was a camera,â McCann said. âSurveillance cameras are really, really helpful to us, because the police are not always there, someone else may not see it, and if we have to rely on eyewitness testimony, sometimes people down here are drinking and they're not as good about identifying what happened.â Denver's DA is hopeful that with the help of residents, businesses and the mayor, crime will continue to trend downward in LoDo. Car theft, fentanyl and gangs will continue to be focuses for her office, she said, as will getting people into services for addiction and mental health treatment. âI wish I had the magic answer,"" McCann concluded. ""But I do think that this is a community that's committed to making it better, and I think that we are going in the right direction. ... What can you all do as a community to help with the perception? Well, number one, talk to your suburban friends. Invite them down here.â"

The incident started when they got a 911 call about a possible hostage situation in a semi-truck parked in the parking lot of a McDonald’s on the southwest side of the city. The officers got to the McDonalds near the I-69 and I-465 along Knight’s Way. “The truck (in question) was pointed out to (officers) and they approached the truck, knocked on the door, and a observed male come out from the sleeping compartment of the semi cab,” said IMPD Asst. Chief Christ Bailey. He says the man, later identified as Lamont Bland, 60, looked at the officers and then retreated back into the sleeping compartment and pulled the curtain. That’s when Bailey says they heard a woman screaming calling out for help. Officers quickly got organized and tried to talk Bland out of the truck. The lead lieutenant at the scene led the effort. “The lieutenant asked the individual to identify himself. He identified himself by first name. He was trying to build a rapport,” Bailey said. “The individual kept saying that he had a knife to the woman’s throat. The woman kept saying she was bleeding.” Body camera footage caught the whole incident, according to Bailey. On that footage, he says you can see Bland on top of the woman in the back of the semi. At that point, he says a shot was fired by the officer. Bland was wounded and died soon afterward. The woman was treated for her injuries at the scene and then taken to IMPD’s Homicide Office to be interviewed about what happened. The lieutenant who fired the shot has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure. Bailey said other officers involved will also get some time off to process the incident.

More on this story: Photographer who captured images of Oconee Co. deputy involved in shooting speaks out Below is the full post from Dec. 1: ""The rollercoaster ride continues with plenty of ups and downs over the last few days. We’ve been waiting to update you so that we would have a better picture of what all is going on. For a short period of time, we weren’t even sure what to report. It through it all, we are grateful to have many praises. ""On Sunday, the medical team switched Lucas’s ventilator to “standby” which meant he was breathing completely on his own! They kept it in his room in case he needed it. (It’s not uncommon for patients to get tired and need to go back on the ventilator for a time.) By Monday morning though, he was still going strong so they removed the ventilator from his room and we praised the Lord for this progress! We were all on cloud nine. ""This high quickly turned south, however, as concern about Lucas’s neurological response grew because he wasn’t responding as well as he had been. Throughout the day, we kept receiving mixed messages. The day honestly just felt very heavy. We continued to cling to the hope and strength the Lord has provided us throughout all of this and as always, it got us through. ""Tuesday was a much more positive day. Haley was able to get clarification on what was going on and Lucas began to show progress again neurologically. Though he’s a few steps behind where he was before, he continues to make progress in a positive ways and the doctors feel confident he will get back to what he was doing before the backwards slide. After talking with others who have experienced brain injuries, we felt reassured that the back and forth is just part of the journey. So, we continue to prayerfully wait. ""Due to the injuries he sustained from the gunshot, the doctors were not able to save his right eye. They removed what remained of it on Wednesday. The procedure went really well and they were able to save approximately 3/4 of his right eye muscles which was good news. They will place a prosthetic eye at a later time. We’re also happy to report he is opening his left eye which is yet another sign of progress! ""Thursday was another positive day. After 2 weeks exactly, Lucas was transferred out of trauma ICU and moved to a step down floor. We know he will be able to rest more and heal quicker not having to be assessed so often throughout the day and night and in a quieter environment. ""Additionally, Haley and other family members were able to sit down with Lucas’s team of doctors to discuss his case and what lies ahead for him. Everyone was positive in their reports and hopes for his recovery. We have our eyes set on getting him into the Shepherd Center in Atlanta for rehab. They are world-renowned and specialize, among numerous neurological disorders, in the treatment and rehabilitation of brain injuries. ""We continue to be in awe as we watch Lucas heal, even when the process is going slower than we wish it was. The brain is such an amazing and complicated organ undoubtedly designed by the hands of our great Creator. By His mercy, our bodies are amazingly resilient. We praise God for His design and creation. We praise Him for his continued work in Lucas, too. ""We covet your prayers and continue to be grateful for the support you provide to us. Times like these are so unique. We recognize that though our world feels like it has stopped turning, yours has not. You have faithfully remained by our sides both figuratively and literally at times. We could never thank you enough. You truly mean the world to us and make all the difference. ""Will you please keep praying for Lucas - that he continues to wake up and regain function and that he will get accepted into the most appropriate rehabilitation center to support his continued recovery? ""Will you also please keep praying for Haley, Eli, our family, and Lucas’s coworkers and friends?

It’s the most such incidents since 2015 when there were 20 officer-involved shootings and 10 fatalities. Since Aug. 1, there have been 13 officer-involved shootings, with nine of the shootings resulting in fatalities. Each officer-involved shooting opens up multiple investigations and processes that go through different IMPD leadership, boards and community groups. ”This investigation is being led by the Critical Incident Response Team,” said IMPD Asst. Chief Chris Bailey, at the scene of the shooting Thursday night. “A parallel administrative investigation will be conducted by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Dept. Internal Affairs Unit.” Once the criminal investigation finishes, the Civilian Majority Use of Force Board will review both investigations. FOX59/CBS4 spoke with IMPD Dep. Chief Catherine Cummings about how the board operates in October. “The board takes whatever particular use of force incident we are presenting to them,” Cummings said. “They go through the hours or day-long hearing. They hear from the people involved, they hear from the experts.” Once the hearing is complete, the board provides its recommendation to Chief Taylor. “The board provides their recommendation to the Chief,” Cummings said. “Whether they feel that the actions were in policy or out of policy and then the Chief takes that into consideration when he’s making his final determination.” The board is made up of four members from IMPD and five civilian members. Two are appointed by Chief Taylor and three are appointed by the City-County Council. In the days after the shooting, IMPD pays the company Critical Incident Videos $6,000 to create a critical incident video of the incident. IMPD passes along body camera video, 911 calls, security camera video and more resources from the scene. FOX59/CBS4 spoke with IMPD Lt. Shane Foley about the process that goes into every critical incident video. ”We do that because we find it’s important that we have that third-party vendor that’s producing the video and doing it independently from the work that were doing,” Foley said. Once IMPD gets the video back, it’s watched by leadership that does have the ability to make changes if they feel there are inaccuracies. Before the video is released, it’s shown to the officer or officers involved and the person shot or family of the person shot. The video is also watched by a community group. Foley said it is made up of more than 50 members of the community, some from each IMPD district. “They let us know what type of content they want to see, if it meets their expectations for what they want shared and it helps them process and gain a better understanding of what’s taking place during these incidents,” Foley said. Of the 17 officer-involved shootings, nine videos have been released, two have been court-ordered to not be released and another is an ISP investigation. IMPD will not release that video until ISP concludes its investigation. That leaves five videos that have not been released yet, including the most recent. According to IMPD data, the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office has only made charging decisions for officers involved in two of the shootings. Charges in the 15 other incidents are still pending."

(KLKN) – A man who was shot by an officer at a north Lincoln hotel last week is facing additional charges. The citations were issued after investigators searched 35-year-old Garrett Hanika’s Jeep, police said Friday. He was additionally cited on suspicion of five more charges, including felony theft and possession of a stolen firearm. On Nov. 21, Officer Nicholas Vest approached Hanika â who was wanted on a federal warrant out of Council Bluffs, Iowa â at the Microtel near 25th and Fairfield streets. Hanika, who was in a Jeep, reversed and crashed into Vestâs cruiser. Police said Hanika also tried to run over Vest, who fired two shots, striking him. A 39-year-old woman got out of the Jeep, and Hanika ran her over, trapping her underneath, according to police. Hanika was treated for two gunshot wounds, one to the head and another to a lower extremity. Once medically cleared, he was arrested on suspicion of several charges, including first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault on an officer. A Lancaster County judge set Hanika’s bond at $250,000.Â He must pay $25,000 to be released from jail."

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department published a Critical Incident Video on Friday compiling security and body-worn camera footage from the incident, which occurred on Oct. 19 at a Speedway gas station in the 2000 block of Shelby Street on the city’s near south side. The shooting According to IMPD, around 7 a.m. officers had just wrapped up an unrelated robbery investigation at the gas station when a person approached them saying a wanted man was inside a car parked at a filling pump. The man, later identified as 38-year-old Antoine Beech, was found to be parked outside and sitting in a white Chevrolet Impala. The person talking to officers said Beech had an active warrant for his arrest, according to IMPD. In the IMPD video released Friday, three officers can be seen on gas station security footage approaching Beech’s car from the front and back sides of the Impala. The security video does not include audio, but the edited footage eventually shows the moment IMPD Patrol Officer Ryan Thomas fires his department-issued firearm at Beech through the car windshield. The IMPD video then confirms that two of the three officers directly involved in the incident, including Ofc. Thomas, did not have their body-worn cameras activated when the shot was fired. The YouTube video proceeds to show edited bodycam footage from the one officer whose camera was activated. That officer can be seen exiting the Speedway after reportedly gathering information on Beech and then approaching the parked white Impala from behind. In the officer’s bodycam footage, which includes audio, both Ofc. Thomas and other unidentified IMPD officers can be heard yelling “Get your hands up!” and “Don’t do it” several times. Less than 30 seconds after initially approaching the car, one shot is heard being fired from Ofc. Thomas’ gun. The IMPD officer whose footage was included in Friday’s video is then seen retreating behind a gas pump and radioing dispatch about an officer-involved shooting. Aftermath Several officers can then be seen walking toward the front passenger door of the Impala and helping Beech get out of the car. “I’m shot. They shot me,” Beech can be heard yelling. “They shot me in my chest.” IMPD later confirmed that Beech was shot in his right hand and had a laceration to his chest. However, no bullet fragment or foreign object was found in his chest. One officer can then be heard asking dispatch for medical assistance while IMPD said other officers began giving Beech first aid. Later, IEMS arrived and drove Beech to a local hospital in stable condition. After Beech was removed from the white Impala, bodycam footage shows one officer approach the open front passenger door and briefly look inside the car while shining a flashlight. “The gun is in the seat,” the officer can be heard saying. While the gun IMPD claims Beech had cannot be seen in the bodycam footage, the department did later provide a photo of the gun. That photo, from the IMPD video released Friday, is below: After receiving treatment for his gunshot wound, Beech was arrested by IMPD on warrants for dealing cocaine, resisting law enforcement and operating a vehicle while intoxicated. He also received an additional charge of unlawful firearm possession by a serious violent felon. IMPD response The IMPD Critical Incident Response Team responded to the scene to conduct the criminal investigation and the Indianapolis-Marion County Forensic Services Agency responded to identify and collect potential forensic evidence. A separate administrative investigation is being conducted by IMPD Internal Affairs and Ofc. Thomas was placed on administrative leave as is standard procedure in an officer-involved shooting investigation. The civilian-majority Use of Force Review Board will conduct a mandatory hearing for any attempted use of deadly force against a person, which occurs after the conclusion of the criminal process. The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office responded to the scene to assist in the investigation and has since been consulted throughout the subsequent legal process, IMPD said. Beech response Following the release of IMPD’s Critical Incident Video on Friday, attorney Andrew Clark Redd, Esq. released the following statement on behalf of Antoine Beech and his family: “Over the course of the last several months, Indianapolis has been plagued by an increase in police-action shootings. Antoine Beech is one of the latest victims of this appalling trend. On October 19th, 2023, IMPD officers were approached by a female who claimed that an individual in her car had an active arrest warrant. Without corroborating her statement, IMPD officers approached the vehicle occupied by Antoine Beech. IMPD quickly drew their weapons and held Antoine at gun point. IMPD Officer Ryan Thomas shot Antoine Beech through Antonie’s right hand and into his chest. We were extremely disappointed to learn that Officer Thomas’ body-worn camera was conveniently not operational during this encounter. The lack of this impartial and unbiased evidence, which is supposed to reduce tensions caused by officer-involved shootings by providing an accurate record of what was done by whom and in what sequence, will now forever deny us the ability to determine whether this shooting was justified or another example of an excessive and unnecessary use of force by law enforcement. Based on the evidence that is currently available to us, we have serious doubts as to the reasonableness of Officer Thomas’ actions. It would be impossible for Antoine to reach for a firearm in a threatening or dangerous manner when Antoine was shot in his right hand, with the bullet entering his palm and exiting out the back of his hand and into his chest, signifying that Antoine’s right hand was raised at the time of the shooting. We are currently reviewing all of Mr. Beech’s legal options with him, and look forward to vigorously defending his rights in these proceedings.” – Andrew Clark Redd, Esq. (Attorney for Antoine Beech) The shooting of Beech marked at least the 8th IMPD officer-involved shooting to occur between August and October 2023. As of Friday, Dec. 1, IMPD has investigated 17 officer-involved shootings on the year. No other civilians or IMPD officers were injured in the shooting.

San Antonio Police Department officials say shots were fired when David Treviño, 49, fled an attempted stop, and information obtained by MySA indicates Treviño has a list of criminal charges and was wanted for an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon warrant from two days prior, November 26. According to a statement from the San Antonio Police Department, officers attempted to stop a vehicle on the frontage road of I-35 near Somerset Road on the Southeast Side of San Antonio around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday because they had reason to believe Treviño was in the vehicle. The vehicle carrying Treviño pulled over and he fled the scene. “During the foot chase, the suspect pointed a handgun at the officers and fired a round. Six officers pursuing the suspect returned fire and struck the suspect several times,” a statement from the San Antonio Police Department reads. “The suspect was transported to a local hospital in critical condition. Three passengers in the vehicle were detained at the scene. It was later discovered that the round fired by the suspect grazed an officer’s body armor plate. The officer did not sustain any injuries.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad More For You Court records obtained by MySA show Treviño was wanted by law enforcement for an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge from November 26 after he reportedly opened fire on a generator his neighbor of 20 years owned. The incident occurred on the city’s near Eastside at an apartment complex in the 200 block of Sandmeyer Street. Treviño’s neighbor identified him as the man who shot at his generator through a single photo shown to the victim. However, this isn’t the first run in with the law Treviño has had. Bexar County Court records show the San Antonio man has criminal charges running back to 1993, including several family violence offenses, aggravated robbery charges, other more minor theft charges, and a charge of illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Just in 2023, Treviño faces five charges, including a June 14 charge of making terroristic threats against the mother of his two children. ""On the morning of June 14, the victim telephoned the defendant, after being informed [Treviño] had been hospitalized,” a warrant for Treviño’s arrest from June reads. ""During their conversation, [Treviño] became upset about losing access to their children. [Treviño] told the victim, ‘I’m going to blow your brains out,’ and ‘I’m going to drag you from your office.

The decision was announced Thursday by the Multnomah County District Attorneyâs Office.Â The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) officers searched for PoniaX Kane Calles, 33, for hours on July 22, after Calles reportedly shot security officer Bobby Smallwood outside the hospitalâs maternity ward, and injured another security officer. Smallwood later died from his injuries. Calles initially fled the scene on a moped, but a PPB sergeant spotted him in East Portland, hiding in some bushes, and later getting into a van driven by a friend he'd called to pick him up. According to police, the sergeant followed the van and called for backup. Officers tracked the van until it eventually stopped in Gresham, where police opened fire. The vanâs driver was uninjured. Officers Justin Thurman, Timothy Hoerauf, and Seth Wingfield were involved in the fatal shooting of Calles. A grand jury returned a not true bill, meaning the jury found the officersâ use of force wasnât criminal. It's still unclear what happened in the moments leading up to officers firing on Calles. The DAâs Office asked the court for permission to release grand jury transcripts to the public, to provide additional transparency about the evidence considered. If the court grants permission, the DA's Office will post transcripts on its website.Â The day of the shooting, Legacy Health President and CEO Kathryn Correia conveyed ""profound grief"" on behalf of Legacy staff. ""We offer our unwavering support to Bobbyâs loved ones, to our patients in our care, to the staff at Legacy Good Samaritan and to all of our employees and providers suffering today,"" Correia said in a published statement. The incident in July caused every Legacy and OHSU medical center in the Portland area to go lockdown. Health care workers received a âcode silverâ alert to run and hide. It also led to calls for increased security measures at local health care sites across Portland. In response, Legacy Health began equipping its previously unarmed security guards with tasers, and added metal detectors to its hospitals. The investigation into Callesâ death by officers is the second officer-involved shooting involving Portland police this year. In 2022, PPB reported nine officer-involved shootings, four of which were fatal, one of which is still listed as âunknown.â Portlandâs system for reviewing police use of deadly force incidents involves an internal review, conducted within the bureau. An outside agency, like the East County Major Crimes Team, is typically also tasked with investigating. Cases also go before Portlandâs Police Review Board, which includes community members, police, and members of the Independent Police Review Division. The District Attorneyâs Office also conducts its own criminal investigation.Â While it won't impact the criminal investigation process, the city's police review system is about to change substantially, to be handled by a Community Board for Police Accountability. The new process, initiated by voters in 2020, will be devoid of police and instead be led by appointed community members.Â Â"

This weekâs slaying of Michael Latt sent shockwaves through Hollywood as the suspect faces charges of murder and burglary. Latt, 33, had worked on projects with filmmakers including Ryan Coogler and Ava DuVernay, as well as rap artist Common. He was pronounced dead Monday in the hospital. Prosecutors allege that Jameelah Elena Michl, 36, knocked on his homeâs door and forced herself inside once it was open. She had sought out Lattâs home âafter she targeted him for being friends with a woman she had been stalking,â the Los Angeles County District Attorneyâs Office said in a news release Thursday. She allegedly fired at him with a semi-automatic handgun. Authorities havenât named the woman but said she was not inside Lattâs home when he was shot. Michlâs arraignment has been continued to Dec. 15, so she has not yet entered a plea, and prosecutors are seeking $3 million bail. If convicted, she could face a sentence of life in prison. Michl will be represented by a public defender, though one had not yet been assigned to her case, the public defenderâs office said. Detectives seized Michlâs vehicle, which she had been living in, as evidence. She stayed at the scene and was taken into custody. Officials have not released details about the alleged stalking. Lattâs marketing firm, Lead with Love, focused on social impact, and he was inspired to start the business after working on Cooglerâs film âFruitvale Station,â about the 2009 fatal police shooting of Oscar Grant in Oakland, California, that starred Michael B. Jordan, and wanted to direct his efforts toward social justice movements. He was born into a show business family: His mother, Michelle Satter, is one of the founding directors of the Sundance Instituteâs artists programs, where she has helped filmmakers such as Coogler and Quentin Tarantino early in their careers. His father, David Latt, is a film producer, and his brother is an agent. Latt had also worked at the Sundance Institute, which issued a statement on behalf of his family. âHe dedicated his career to serving others, employing storytelling, art, and various mediums to create enduring change and galvanizing communities with hope, love, and inspiration,â the statement said. âMichael will never be forgotten and his legacy and work will carry on through his family, his friends, and his colleagues.â Latt also worked with Common, on the Oscars campaign for the song âLetter to the Free,â and with DuVernay. Together, they launched a concert prison tour and helped developed Commonâs nonprofit Imagine Justice. âThe moment I realized that I could use my skill set for social good, I decided to dedicate the rest of my career to helping others, empowering storytellers of color, and fighting injustice wherever it stands,â Latt told Forbes in 2019. âThrough stories and art, we can showcase incarcerated and formerly incarcerated men and womenâs humanity, shine a light on injustices in the system and shift the narrative about how we talk about the issues.â STEFANIE DAZIO, Associated Press"

The critic Laura Cappelle saw “Carte Noire Named Desire” in Paris. - Black Card Named Desire One performer is missing from the current Parisian run of Rébecca Chaillon’s “Carte Noire Named Desire,” an arresting show about the experiences of Black women in France. When the actors gathered onstage for a dinner scene at the Odéon–Théâtre de l’Europe this week, Fatou Siby’s chair remained empty, and a monologue inspired by her life was delivered instead by a guest artist. The reason for Siby’s absence? She and other members of the all-Black cast were targets of racist attacks after “Carte Noire” played this summer at the Avignon Festival, which followed widespread protests in France over the police shooting of Nahel M., a 17-year-old of North African descent. “I need to protect myself,” Siby told the French news site Mediapart of her decision to withdraw from the Paris performances. In one short scene from “Carte Noire,” the cast stages a game of charades inspired by anti-Black racism. To help the audience guess the answer “colonization” this summer, Siby went into the auditorium and jokingly took bags and coats belonging to audience members. (The items were then set aside near the exit to be collected after the show.) According to Mediapart, one male audience member forcefully twisted Siby’s arm as she performed the scene. Others physically hit performers, called them “dictators” and implied they didn’t belong in France. In the days that followed, Siby told Mediapart, an audience member accosted her and her child on the street in Avignon. Since the incidents became public — in a statement, the Avignon Festival described them as “an outpouring of hate” — Chaillon and her team have also been cyber-harassed and become the subject of far-right pundits. Sitting in the audience at the Odéon this week, I found it hard not to feel anger on behalf of the seven cast members who have soldiered on. “Carte Noire” relies on their willingness to be highly vulnerable onstage. The excessive media attention on the charades scene obscured the rest of the piece, which is by turns powerful, lyrical and visually dazzling — an ode to Black women’s imagination in a world whose default setting is whiteness. “Carte Noire Named Desire” — the title is a play on a famous French ad for the coffee brand — offers some redress, starting with the seating arrangement. As the audience streams into the theater, a recorded announcement explains that 20 or so seats are reserved on comfortable-looking couches at the back of the stage for Black women or nonbinary people. There, they’re handed drinks, while the rest of the audience remains in folding seats for the next 2 hours and 40 minutes. The first half-hour prompts a different kind of discomfort. On her hands and knees, Chaillon, dressed in white, with white lenses covering her pupils and white powder all over her skin, tries to scrub an all-white floor clean, even as darker liquid drips from cups above her. As the scene stretches on, she starts stripping and using her own clothes as mops, ultimately dragging herself around the floor to wipe it. Coolly, without a word, the scene speaks to the disproportionate number of Black people in menial jobs in France. Chaillon, a bold performer and director who has been at the helm of her own company, Dans le Ventre, since 2006, excels at showing before telling. A castmate ultimately pulls her from the floor, and slowly washes the white powder off her body. Then the other women gather around her to braid oversized ropes into her hair — an evocative variation on a Black hair salon. The scenes that follow are often humorous and surreal. Chaillon reads from classified ads written by white men looking for Black women. Makeda Monnet, a trained soprano, trills her way through a song about coffee — a product often produced in colonized countries — on a table engulfed in white foam, before being covered in a cloud of cocoa powder. On the night I attended, however, the game of charades steered clear of its most controversial element. While the performers had audience members guess “Black Sea,” “Josephine Baker” or the film “12 Years a Slave,” the game didn’t include “colonization,” and no bags or coats were taken. While that word was intentionally removed from one Avignon performance to protect the cast, a spokeswoman for Dans Le Ventre said that its absence in Paris that night was random; charade rounds are sometimes skipped over when the game runs too long. What remained that night was a deeply felt production, interspersed with skits and monologues that walk a fine line between true accounts of pain and quasi-performance poetry. On that day, the story of the absent Siby was delivered by special guest Alice Diop, the filmmaker behind the award-winning “Saint Omer,” who sat on the couches in the back with other Black women. At the very end, the audience was left with an indelible tableau: Chaillon, naked, her heavy braids attached to a tangle of ropes above, as the other women sat at her feet — all assembled like roots in a tree of life. That any actor would be fearful of joining them onstage in “Carte Noire” only proves Chaillon’s point: For Black women, even an act of community is political. Carte Noire Named Desire Odéon–Théâtre de l’Europe through Dec. 17; theatre-odeon.eu Arts and Culture Across Europe The actress Rebecca Frecknall steers Federico García Lorca’s play “The House of Bernarda Alba” to its tragic finish in Alice Birch’s version at the National Theater in London. The Reethaus, a new cultural venue in Berlin, inspires events that are immersive, experimental and surprisingly spiritual. The newly renovated Notre-Dame isn’t scheduled to reopen to the public until 2024, but some of the cathedral’s oldest treasures are now on display at the Louvre. The veteran actor Kenneth Branagh directs and plays the title role in a brisk and curiously weightless London production of “King Lear.” Barrie Kosky’s Berlin production of the 1975 musical “Chicago” goes back to the original concept of the show as a musical vaudeville. For nearly 50 years, a room beneath the Medici Chapels in Florence where Michelangelo possibly hid and drew on the walls has been closed to the public. That will now change."

Taisyn Crutchfield did not attend and cannot discuss the case, according to Gage. “It would open her up to more retaliation,” he said. Tony Crutchfield said he was there to represent his daughter, who he described as a good woman who wanted to be a police officer, with the goal of bridging the gap between police and the community. “She is also a Black American,” Gage said. “Sadly, her race has eclipsed her other achievements, subjecting her to discrimination and retaliation at the Pasadena Police Department.” The Pasadena police chief, Gene Harris, is also Black. In response to the claim, the city issued a statement saying, “The facts alleged about the incident are inaccurate, as is evident in the video,” a reference to body cam footage the city released. “The city will vigorously defend itself in this matter and the facts will prevail.” The claim stems from what happened on Feb. 20 at Walnut Street and Marengo Avenue around 2 a.m. An officer noticed what looked like an argument among three people, according to Harris. Police ended up detaining and putting handcuffs on Carlos Towns, his mother Barsha Knox and his brother. They were not arrested or cited. Carlos Towns and the minor are the sons of Charles Towns, who had been fatally shot by deputies in Altadena on Jan. 22. In the video, Crutchfield can be seen pushing or touching another officer at one point. In her claim, she said an officer was speaking with Knox and Carlos Towns when Officer Ralph Palacios ran over from the police department and aggressively took hold of Carlos Towns. “Palacios violently face-planted unarmed Towns in the flower planter which had cactus. Palacios then handcuffed Carlos, causing him pain and bruising,” the claim states. Knox tried to intervene. Palacios allegedly yelled at Knox, who then was handcuffed by a female officer. “Knox feared for the life of her children and she recognized Palacios from the El Sereno Avenue shooting where he was rude and aggressive as well. She told Palacios words to the effect that ‘you should not be on the street because you are too aggressive,’ ” according to the claim. Palacios allegedly continued to yell at Knox and approached her, coming within one to two feet and “causing her to have an apprehension of imminent unlawful and harmful touching,” the claim says. Crutchfield intervened by “lightly touching” Palacios and moving between him and Knox, according to the claim. Palacios was guided away from Knox and the situation de-escalated. But Palacios responded by pushing Crutchfield, using a profanity and yelling at her not to touch him, the claim states. A sergeant told Crutchfield to return to the station and interrogated her there, the claim says, adding the interrogation was a violation of the Peace Officers Bill of Rights. If an officer is going to be investigated, and that investigation can lead to disciplinary action, there are a number of rights afforded to officers under the Peace Officers Bill of Rights which include the right to be advised of the charges against them, the right to obtain counsel and/or an employee representative, the right to see documents and other protections, none of which were afforded to Crutchfield, the claim states. She was told on April 13 that she was being placed on administrative leave. None of the other officers, including Palacios, was placed on leave, the claim said. “Officer Crutchfield deserved a commendation for her swift and heroic action, avoiding needless violence. Instead, she was relieved of duty and punished,” Gage said. Lisa Derderian, spokeswoman for Pasadena, said the city was being transparent in releasing the video as soon as possible to clarify miscommunications circulating in the community. The city has 45 days to respond to a claim. If the city doesn’t take action within the 45 days, Derderian said the law considers the claim rejected. Crutchfield joined Pasadena Police in May 2021. She has a bachelor’s and master’s degree in criminology, was an NCAA track star and a former Miss Eugene (Oregon), Gage said, adding she is running for Miss Oregon next year. “The Pasadena Police Department has a history of racial discrimination, racial profiling, disparities of punishment of African American employees and retaliation against those officers who are whistleblowers or complain about discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Officer Crutchfield is the latest victim,” Gage said. “The Pasadena Police Department proudly serves the residents of Pasadena with honor and integrity, and is proud of its diversity throughout all ranks of the Department,” the city responded.

Authentic voice. Authentic self. Authenticity as artifice. Lookups for the word are routinely heavy on the dictionary company’s site but were boosted to new heights throughout the year, editor at large Peter Sokolowski told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview. “We see in 2023 a kind of crisis of authenticity,” he said ahead of Monday’s announcement of this year’s word. “What we realize is that when we question authenticity, we value it even more.” Sokolowski and his team don’t delve into the reasons people head for dictionaries and websites in search of specific words. Rather, they chase the data on lookup spikes and world events that correlate. This time around, there was no particularly huge boost at any given time but a constancy to the increased interest in “authentic.” This was the year of artificial intelligence, for sure, but also a moment when ChatGPT-maker OpenAI suffered a leadership crisis. Taylor Swift and Prince Harry chased after authenticity in their words and deeds. Musk himself, at February’s World Government Summit in Dubai, urged the heads of companies, politicians, ministers and other leaders to “speak authentically” on social media by running their own accounts. “Can we trust whether a student wrote this paper? Can we trust whether a politician made this statement? We don’t always trust what we see anymore,” Sokolowski said. “We sometimes don’t believe our own eyes or our own ears. We are now recognizing that authenticity is a performance itself.” Merriam-Webster’s entry for “authentic” is busy with meaning. There’s “not false or imitation: real, actual,” as in an authentic cockney accent. There’s “true to one’s own personality, spirit or character.” There’s “worthy of acceptance or belief as conforming to or based on fact.” There’s “made or done the same way as an original.” And, perhaps the most telling, there’s “conforming to an original so as to reproduce essential features.” “Authentic” follows 2022’s choice of “gaslighting.” And 2023 marks Merriam-Webster’s 20th anniversary choosing a top word. The company’s data crunchers filter out evergreen words like “love” and “affect” vs. “effect” that are always high in lookups among the 500,000 words it defines online. This year, the wordsmiths also filtered out numerous five-letter words because Wordle and Quordle players clearly use the company’s site in search of them as they play the daily games, Sokolowski said. Sokolowski, a lexicologist, and his colleagues have a bevy of runners-up for word of the year that also attracted unusual traffic. They include “X” (lookups spiked in July after Musk’s rebranding of Twitter), “EGOT” (there was a boost in February when Viola Davis achieved that rare quadruple-award status with a Grammy) and “Elemental,” the title of a new Pixar film that had lookups jumping in June. Rounding out the company’s top words of 2023, in no particular order: RIZZ: It’s slang for “romantic appeal or charm” and seemingly short for charisma. Merriam-Webster added the word to its online dictionary in September and it’s been among the top lookups since, Sokolowski said. KIBBUTZ: There was a massive spike in lookups for “a communal farm or settlement in Israel” after Hamas militants attacked several near the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7. The first kibbutz was founded circa 1909 in what is today Israel. IMPLODE: The June 18 implosion of the Titan submersible on a commercial expedition to explore the Titanic wreckage sent lookups soaring for this word, meaning “to burst inward.” “It was a story that completely occupied the world,” Sokolowski said. DEADNAME: Interest was high in what Merriam-Webster defines as “the name that a transgender person was given at birth and no longer uses upon transitioning.” Lookups followed an onslaught of legislation aimed at curtailing LGBTQ+ rights around the country. DOPPELGANGER: Sokolowski calls this “a word lover’s word.” Merriam-Webster defines it as a “double,” an “alter ego” or a “ghostly counterpart.” It derives from German folklore. Interest in the word surrounded Naomi Klein’s latest book, “Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World,” released this year. She uses her own experience of often being confused with feminist author and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf as a springboard into a broader narrative on the crazy times we’re all living in. CORONATION: King Charles III had one on May 6, sending lookups for the word soaring 15,681% over the year before, Sokolowski said. Merriam-Webster defines it as “the act or occasion of crowning.” DEEPFAKE: The dictionary company’s definition is “an image or recording that has been convincingly altered and manipulated to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something that was not actually done or said.” Interest spiked after Musk’s lawyers in a Tesla lawsuit said he is often the subject of deepfake videos and again after the likeness of Ryan Reynolds appeared in a fake, AI-generated Tesla ad. DYSTOPIAN: Climate chaos brought on interest in the word. So did books, movies and TV fare intended to entertain. “It’s unusual to me to see a word that is used in both contexts,” Sokolowski said. COVENANT: Lookups for the word meaning “a usually formal, solemn, and binding agreement” swelled on March 27, after a deadly mass shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee. The shooter was a former student killed by police after killing three students and three adults. Interest also spiked with this year’s release of “Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant” and Abraham Verghese’s long-awaited new novel, “The Covenant of Water,” which Oprah Winfrey chose as a book club pick. More recently, soon after U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson ascended to House speaker, a 2022 interview with the Louisiana congressman recirculated. He discussed how his teen son was then his “accountability partner” on Covenant Eyes, software that tracks browser history and sends reports to each partner when porn or other potentially objectionable sites are viewed. INDICT: Former President Donald Trump has been indicted on felony charges in four criminal cases in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C., in addition to fighting a lawsuit that threatens his real estate empire."

Officer Darius Rackley, a motorcycle cop for CHP, testified at an inquest hearing that in the moments after watching 31-year-old Pittsburg resident Elsy Zapien-Vasquez rear-end a large, green transport truck, he went from attempting to arrest her to trying to save her life as the engine to the SUV caught fire. Rackley attempted to smash out a window from the SUV and used a fire extinguisher from a good Samaritan to try and put out the blaze, he testified. Despite the efforts, Zapien-Vasquez died from multiple blunt force injuries sustained in the crash, including damage to her spleen, kidneys, lungs and massive internal bleeding, pathologist Dr. Ikechi Ogan testified Friday. Zapien-Vasquez suffered third-degree burns and her blood showed signs she’d recently ingested methamphetamine, Ogan added. Rackley testified he was conducting speed enforcement on Highway 4 that day when he clocked the SUV driven by Zapien-Vasquez at 99 miles per hour. He attempted to stop the car but she continued on, weaving through traffic. Rackley said he stopped the pursuit when she got off on Contra Loma Boulevard, but that she crashed while attempting to re-enter the freeway, after running a red light. Video played before the inquest jury shows Zapien-Vasquez rear-end the truck at a high rate of speed, and Rackley’s motorcycle comes into view a few seconds later. Coroner’s inquests are held for all law enforcement deaths in Contra Costa County, from police shootings to natural fatalities of people in custody. Jurors are tasked with deciding the official manner of death, but their decision holds no civil nor criminal liability. The jury ruled Zapien-Vasquez’s death was an accident."

Fowler allegedly called DA Gerald Byers about an officer-involved shooting between a Las Cruces police officer and Teresa Gomez. She was shot by Officer Felipe Hernandez when she tried to drive away during a traffic stop. She later died of her injuries, and Hernandez has not been charged with any crime related to Gomez's death. Police body camera footage from the Oct. 3 shooting went viral, prompting Fowler's calls to the DA. âThis was a case out of Las Cruces,â said John Day, a legal expert for KOAT, ABC-7's sister station in Albuquerque. ""People all over the country were seeing it. And apparently, it had that got one person in Ohio so angry that he decided to break the law."" According to court documents, Byers received a voicemail about the case on Oct. 26. The FBI said they tracked the call to Lodi, Ohio, and charged Fowler with transmitting threats across state lines. Day explained that the FBI found a man in Ohio who apparently used the phone to call DA Byers, ""and made some specific threats, used very explicit racial language, and made threats about putting the DA in a noose."" âA hate crime under federal law is a crime that's motivated by hatred, bias, prejudice towards anybody because of their skin color, their religion, their race, or gender. So, is it possible that there could be an additional hate crime charge? It's certainly possible,"" Day said. ABC-7 reached out to the DoÃ±a Ana County District Attorney's Office, who referred us to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico. They told us they cannot comment on pending investigations."

Lamar Deshawn Young, 33, was killed after police say he fired at them when they attempted to arrest him, according to a spokesperson for the Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Office. Police attempted to Young at a location in the 3100 block of Bellwood Place, where he allegedly believed he was meeting a 15-year-old female for sex. Upon the suspect entering the home, officers reportedly attempted to place him in custody. Reports indicated that he resisted arrest, leading to him allegedly drawing a weapon and firing at the officers. Young had been released from federal prison in January and was required to wear a GPS ankle monitor at the time of the shooting, according to the spokesperson. According to the North Carolina Department of Adult Corrections, Young had previously served time for manslaughter and a drug-related charge. The manslaughter charges relate to a shooting in 2009 that left a man dead in Concord. The shooting is being investigated by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation to ensure all polices and procedures were correctly followed. All officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with policy for both the sheriff’s office and police department for all officer-involved shooting incidents, according to the release. Once the SBI investigation is completed, all information will be forwarded to the district attorney’s office for review."

We omitted footage that shows the actual shooting. Footage released on Friday shows the terror that unfolded in the streets of Woodland Hills and Calabasas when a homeless man first attacked someone with a machete and then ran into a popular restaurant where he was fatally shot by police. The incident took place on Nov. 1 when 911 dispatchers received a call from a man who said he had been attacked by another man with a machete at the McDonald’s at Mulholland Drive near the 101 Freeway. “I was able to get away from him, and then he kept attacking me,” the victim told the 911 dispatcher. “We need to get in control of these homeless people,” he added. The man said he was not seriously hurt and did not require a paramedic. His attacker, later identified as Benjamin Pritchard, 35, had dropped the machete and was wandering through the parking lot of the busy shopping center when police arrived. Dash camera video released by the Los Angeles Police Department on Friday shows officers first trying to stop Pritchard near the McDonald’s, and then near the southbound 101 Freeway onramp at Mulholland Drive/Valley Circle Boulevard. When they approach him at the ramp, Pritchard charges at the police SUV with a knife and hits the vehicle before running away, the video shows. Pritchard then runs along traffic on Calabasas Road next to the Motion Picture & Television Fund complex and eventually into the parking lot of the Sagebrush Cantina, a popular restaurant and music venue in Old Town Calabasas. “Everyone, get inside the restaurant and lock the doors! This is the LAPD! Lock the doors!” an officer shouts through the SUV’s PA system. Security cameras and police body-worn cameras captured the violent end to the ordeal. Pritchard first emerges with a bottle and a knife at which point an officer who is chasing him on foot fires his Taser, which had little or no effect, the video shows. “Drop the knife!” officers yell repeatedly. Another camera angle shows Pritchard running into a patio dining area as a restaurant patron or employee flees to the back. Officers then opened fire with their service weapons, striking Pritchard who fell to the ground. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. No officers or witnesses were injured. Police say Pritchard was from San Diego County. While the toxicology report has not been released, officers believed he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident.

When officers broke the driverâs side window and opened that door after hearing the woman call for help, police quoted the man as saying: “Iâm going to kill her,” “I got a knife to her throat” and “Youâre gonna die.” The woman then cried out, “Iâm dying, help me,” “Iâm bleeding out, help me” and “He’s killing me” before officers entered the sleeping compartment.

IMPD were wrapping up a separate investigation at a Speedway gas station on Shelby Street when someone approached the officers and informed them that a man inside of a White Chevy Impala had a warrant. The man was Antoine Beech, 38, and he was sitting passenger side. Three officers approached the car, and they claim Beech was not showing his hands, and eventually reached for a gun. That’s when IMPD Officer Thomas shot Beech. Thomas’ body-camera was not active. Surveillance footage and body-camera footage from another officer do not clearly show Beech reaching for a gun, although one was recovered from the passenger side. Beech survived and was later arrested. No one else was hurt. Beech was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon, and also had violated probation.

Rockwell – a friend of Latt’s whom prosecutors allege Michl was stalking. “One pull of the trigger, and I’ll be free.” It was just a portion of one of several “extremely long and threatening” messages that Rockwell cited when asking the court for a restraining order earlier this year. HOLLYWOOD SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIOR ALLEGEDLY KILLED BY HOMELESS WOMAN IN OWN HOME Excerpts were posted earlier by The Associated Press. In another missive, Michl allegedly threatened to shoot herself in Griffith Park, about five miles from Latt’s condo. Prosecutors said Thursday afternoon that Michl knocked on Latt’s door, forced her way inside and then shot the 33-year-old with a semiautomatic handgun in his $800,000, one-bedroom apartment in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood around 6 p.m. Monday. At least one other person was inside and escaped injury. Authorities said it was not Rockwell. Latt shared the home with his fiancée, according to neighbors. LA INTERNAL AFFAIRS WATCHDOG ACCUSES LEFTIST BOSS OF HIDING FACTS TO THWART SHERIFF’S RE-ELECTION Prosecutors said that Michl targeted Latt because of his friendship with Rockwell. Los Angeles police arrested her at the scene and rushed Latt to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Michl had worked on Rockwell’s award-winning new film, “A Thousand And One,” the Los Angeles Times reported. However, she was living out of her car, which police also seized as evidence. “As you continue to bask in the glory of ‘A Thousand and One,’ l want you to remember, and not forget all the hell that people went through to help bring your masterpiece to the screen,” Michl wrote to the director in April, according to the documents.

She faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. Latt came from a well-established Hollywood family. His mother, Michelle Satter, was a founding director at the Sundance Institute. His father is a producer, and his brother is a top talent agent at CAA. The victim was the chief executive and chief financial officer of a marketing firm he founded called Lead With Love, where his stated goal was to “dedicate his career to being of service, supporting influential women and artists of color and utilizing storytelling, art and more to spark lasting change and bring hope, love and inspiration to communities.” Latt worked on films including “Fruitvale Station,” about the Oakland, California, police-involved shooting that killed Oscar Grant in 2009, and “Till,” a biographical film about the mother of lynching victim Emmett Till, according to Lead With Love. He has also been a vocal supporter of progressive social justice causes and has been seen attending Black Lives Matter protests.

The dogs pounced on Brittany Skoland around 11:30 a.m. Nov. 24 outside her home in Fort Dodge, a city 100 miles northwest of Des Moines. Police were called after a neighbor reported hearing “someone yelling for help.” “The officer attempted to scare the dogs away to stop them from attacking the woman, but the dogs would not stop,” Chief Dennis Quinn said in a statement. With no other option, the officer fired at the animals, killing all three. Skoland was rushed to a nearby hospital, but her injuries proved so severe that she was airlifted to the Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines, known for its verified adult trauma center. “Brittany has lost a lot more then we originally thought, She’s had many surgeries and procedures in the last few days,” her aunt Teresa Hanus wrote in an online fundraiser. “She has had both legs amputated to her knees and parts of her hands. She is going to need facial reconstruction surgery, she also has serious head trauma and much more.” The devastated family plans to use the raised funds to make Skoland’s home wheelchair accessible. “If you know Brittany you know her life is to be outside doing yard work, helping her mom decorate for holidays, and walking/playing with her younger children,” Skoland’s friend Jayden Louise Johnson wrote on Facebook. Police are still investigating the mauling, but have not filed any charges. While some shocked neighbors said the pit bulls were typically obedient to their owner, others claimed they’ve had problems with the dogs in the past. One resident told KCCI it took several rounds to finally subdue the attacking animals. “I was sitting in my living room, and I was just sitting there and all of a sudden I heard bang bang bang, and I come to the door and I seen all the cops, well there was only one at the time, and I seen the lady laying on the ground and the dogs going at her and the cops shot them. And it was quite a few rounds of ammunition to get them down,” Rosemary Possehn said."
