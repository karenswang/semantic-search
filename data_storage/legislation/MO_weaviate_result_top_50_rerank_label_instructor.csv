Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others. 8.  Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 limits the applicability of any  reasonable  local  or  state  restriction  regarding  the  maximum  number  of  occupants HB 2478 permitted to occupy a dwelling, nor does any provision in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older persons. 9.

Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons by reason of: (1)  Persons residing in such housing as of August 28, 1992, who do not meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section, provided that new occupants of such housing meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section; or (2)  Unoccupied units, provided that such units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section. 11. Nothing in this section or section 213.045 or 213.050 shall prohibit conduct against  a  person  because  such  person  has  been  convicted  by  any  court  of  competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance, as defined by section 195.010. 12.

For purposes of this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050, discrimination includes: (1)  A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person with the disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a modification on the renter's agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted; (2)  A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or (3)  In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, a failure to design and construct those dwellings in such a manner that: (a)  The public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily accessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (b)  All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within such dwellings are sufficiently SB 787 wide to allow passage by persons with a disability in wheelchairs; and (c)  All premises within such dwellings contain the following features of adaptive design: a.

Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others. SB 787 8.  Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 limits the applicability of any reasonable local or state restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling, nor does any provision in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older persons. 9.  As used in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050, \""housing for older persons\"" means housing: (1)  Provided under any state or federal program that the commission determines is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons, as defined in the state or federal program; (2)  Intended for, and solely occupied by, persons sixty-two years of age or older; or (3)  Intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person fifty-five years of age or older per unit.  In determining whether housing qualifies as housing for older persons under this subsection, the commission shall develop regulations which require at least the following factors: (a)  The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities and services is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons; and (b)  That at least eighty percent of the units are occupied by at least one person fifty-five years of age or older per unit; and (c)  The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or SB 787 manager to provide housing for persons fifty-five years of age or older. 10.  Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons by reason of: (1)  Persons residing in such housing as of August 28, 1992, who do not meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section, provided that new occupants of such housing meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section; or (2)  Unoccupied units, provided that such units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section. 11.  Nothing in this section or section 213.045 or 213.050 shall prohibit conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance, as defined by section 195.010. 12.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a religious organization, association, or society, or any nonprofit institution or organization operated, supervised or controlled by or in conjunction with a religious organization, association, or society, from limiting the sale, rental or occupancy of dwellings which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose to persons of the same religion, or from giving preference to such persons, unless membership in such religion is restricted on account of race, color, or national origin.  Nor shall anything in this chapter prohibit a private club not in fact open to the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides lodging which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting SB 787 the rental or occupancy of such lodging to its members or from giving preference to its members. 13.  Nothing in this chapter, other than the prohibitions against discriminatory advertising in subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section, shall apply to: (1)  The sale or rental of any single family house by a private individual owner, provided the following conditions are met: (a)  The private individual owner does not own or have any interest in more than three single family houses at any one time; and (b)  The house is sold or rented without the use of a real estate broker, agent or salesperson or the facilities of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings and without publication, posting or mailing of any advertisement.  If the owner selling the house does not reside in it at the time of the sale or was not the most recent resident of the house prior to such sale, the exemption in this section applies to only one such sale in any twenty-four-month period; or (2)  Rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his or her residence. 213.045.  It shall be unlawful for any bank, building and loan association, insurance company or other corporation, association, firm or enterprise whose business consists in whole or in part in the making of commercial real estate loans, to deny a loan or other financial assistance because of race, color, religion, national SB 787 origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or familial status to a person applying therefor for the purpose of purchasing, construction, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling, or to discriminate against himsuch person in fixing of the amount, interest rate, duration or other terms or conditions of such loan or other financial assistance, because of the race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or familial status of such person or of any person associated with himsuch person in connection with such loan or other financial assistance, or of the present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupants, of the dwellings in relation to which such loan or other financial assistance is to be made or given. 213.050.

The person authorized to complete the medical certification may, in writing, designate any other  person  to  enter  the  medical  certification  information  into  the  electronic  death registration system if the person authorized to complete the medical certificate has physically or  by  electronic  process  signed  a  statement  stating  the  cause  of  death. Any  persons completing the medical certification or entering data into the electronic death registration system shall be immune from civil liability for such certification completion, data entry, or determination of the cause of death, absent gross negligence or willful misconduct.

If the death is determined to be of a natural cause, the medical examiner or coroner or local registrar shall refer the certificate of death to the attending physician, physician assistant, assistant  physician,  or  advanced  practice  registered  nurse  for  such  certification. If  the attending physician, physician assistant, assistant physician, or advanced practice registered nurse refuses or is otherwise unavailable, the medical examiner or coroner or local registrar HB 1599 shall attest to the accuracy of the certificate of death either by signature or an approved electronic process within thirty-six hours. 7.  If the circumstances suggest that the death was caused by other than natural causes, the medical examiner or coroner shall determine the cause of death and shall, either by signature or an approved electronic process, complete and attest to the accuracy of the medical certification within seventy-two hours after taking charge of the case. 8.  If the cause of death cannot be determined within seventy-two hours after death, the attending medical examiner, coroner, attending physician, physician assistant, assistant physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or local registrar shall give the funeral director, or person in charge of final disposition of the dead body, notice of the reason for the delay, and final disposition of the body shall not be made until authorized by the medical examiner, coroner,  attending  physician,  physician  assistant,  assistant  physician,  advanced  practice registered nurse, or local registrar. 9. When a death is presumed to have occurred within this state but the body cannot be located, a death certificate may be prepared by the state registrar upon receipt of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction which shall include the finding of facts required to complete the death certificate.

Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if a coroner or deputy coroner  is  not  current  with  or  is  without  the  approved  training  under  chapter  58,  the department of health and senior services shall prohibit such coroner from attesting to the accuracy of a certificate of death.  No person elected or appointed to the office of coroner can assume such elected office until the training, as established by the coroner standards and training commission under the provisions of  section 58.035, has been  completed and  a certificate of completion has been issued. In the event a coroner cannot fulfill his or her duties or is no longer qualified to attest to the accuracy of a death certificate, the sheriff of the HB 1599 county shall appoint a medical professional to attest death certificates until such time as the coroner can resume his or her duties or another coroner is appointed or elected to the office. 197.178. 1.

It shall be an unlawful discriminatory housing practice: (1)  To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, to deny, or to otherwise make unavailable a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status; (2)  To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status; (3)  To make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published, any notice, statement, or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status or that indicates an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination; HB 2000 (4)  To represent to any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry,  sex,  disability,  or  familial  status  that  any  dwelling  is  not  available  for inspection, sale, or rental if such dwelling is in fact so available; (5)  To induce or attempt to induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status; (6)  To discriminate in the sale or rental of, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a disability of: (a)  That buyer or renter; (b)  A person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or (c)  Any person associated with that buyer or renter; or (7)  To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a disability of: (a)  That person; (b)  A person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or (c)  Any person associated with that person. 2.

As used in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, the term \""covered multifamily dwellings\"" means: (1)  Buildings consisting of four or more units if such buildings have one or more elevators; and (2)  Ground floor units in buildings consisting of four or more units. 4. Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American National Standard for Buildings and Facilities, commonly cited as \""ANSI A117.1\"", providing accessibility and usability for people with physical disabilities, suffices to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section. 5. If a unit of general local government has incorporated into its laws the requirements set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, compliance with such  laws  shall  be  deemed  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  that  subdivision. Such compliance shall be subject to the following provisions: (1) A unit  of  general  local  government  may  review  and  approve  newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings for the purpose of making determinations as to whether the design and construction requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section are met; (2)  The commission shall encourage, but shall not require, the units of general local government to include in their existing procedures for the review and approval of newly  constructed  covered  multifamily  dwellings  determinations  as  to  whether  the design  and  construction  of  such  dwellings  are  consistent  with  subdivision  (3)  of subsection 2 of this section and shall provide technical assistance to units of general local government and other persons to implement the requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section; and (3) Nothing in sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall be construed to require the commission to review or approve the plans, designs, or construction of all covered multifamily  dwellings  to  determine  whether  the  design  and  construction  of  such HB 2000 dwellings are consistent with the requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section. 6.  Nothing in sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall be construed to invalidate or limit any law of the state or political subdivision of the state, or other jurisdiction in which sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall be effective, that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords persons with disabilities greater access than is required by sections 213.150 to 213.188. 7.  Nothing in this section, section 213.158, or section 213.161 shall require that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others. 8. Nothing in this section, section 213.158, or section 213.161 shall limit the applicability  of  any  reasonable  local  or  state  restriction  regarding  the  maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling, nor shall any provision in this section, section 213.158, or section 213.161 regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older persons. 9.

HB 2000 10.  Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons by reason of: (1)  Persons residing in such housing as of August 28, 2024, who do not meet the age requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision (1) of subsection 9 of this section, provided that new occupants of such housing meet the age requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision (1) of subsection 9 of this section; or (2)  Unoccupied units, provided that such units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision (1) of subsection 9 of this section. 11. Nothing in this section, section 213.158, or section 213.161 shall prohibit conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent  jurisdiction  of  the  illegal  manufacture  or  distribution  of  a  controlled substance, as defined by section 195.010. 12. (1) Nothing  in  sections  213.150  to  213.188  shall  prohibit  a  religious organization,  association,  or  society;  or  any  nonprofit  institution  or  organization operated, supervised, or controlled by or in conjunction with a religious organization, association, or society; from limiting the sale, rental, or occupancy of dwellings that it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose to persons of the same religion, or  from  giving  preference  to  such  persons,  unless  membership  in  such  religion  is restricted on account of race, color, or national origin. (2)  Nothing in sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall prohibit a private club, not in fact open to the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides lodging that it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodging to its members or from giving preference to its members. 13.  Nothing in sections 213.150 to 213.188, other than the prohibitions against discriminatory advertising in subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section, shall apply to: (1)  The sale or rental of any single-family house by a private individual owner, provided the following conditions are met: (a)  The private individual owner does not own or have any interest in more than three single-family houses at any one time; and (b)  The house is sold or rented without the use of a real estate broker, agent, or salesperson or the facilities of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings and without publication, posting, or mailing of any advertisement.  If the owner selling the house does not reside in it at the time of the sale or was not the most recent resident HB 2000 of the house prior to such sale, the exemption in this section shall apply to only one such sale in any twenty-four-month period; or (2)  Rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other if the owner maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his or her residence. 213.155. 1. No declaration or other governing document of a homeowners' association shall include a restrictive covenant in violation of section 213.152. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or provision of the governing documents, the board of directors of a homeowners' association shall amend, without approval of the owners, any declaration or other governing document that includes a restrictive covenant in violation of section 213.152 and shall restate the declaration or other governing document without the restrictive covenant but with no other change to the declaration or governing document. 3.  If, after providing written notice to a homeowners' association requesting that the  association  delete  a  restrictive  covenant  in  violation  of  section  213.152,  the association fails to delete the restrictive covenant within thirty days of receiving the notice, the Missouri commission on human rights, a city or county in which a common interest  development  is  located,  or  any  person  may  bring  an  action  against  the homeowners' association for injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 of this section.  The court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party. 213.158. It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  bank,  building  and  loan  association, insurance  company,  or  other  corporation,  association,  firm,  or  enterprise  whose business consists in whole or in part of the making of commercial real estate loans to deny a loan or other financial assistance because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status to a person applying therefor for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling. It shall be unlawful to discriminate against such person in fixing of the amount, interest rate, duration, or other terms or conditions of such loan or other financial assistance because of the race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status of such  person  or  of  any  person  associated  with  such  person  or  of  the  present  or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupants of the dwellings. 213.161.  It shall be unlawful to deny any person access to, or membership or participation in, any multiple listing service, real estate brokers' organization, or other service  organization,  or  any  facility  relating  to  the  business  of  selling  or  renting dwellings, because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status. 213.164.  It shall be an unlawful discriminatory housing practice: HB 2000 (1) To aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the commission of acts prohibited under sections 213.150 to 213.188 or to attempt to do so; (2)  To retaliate or discriminate in any manner against any person because such person has opposed any practice prohibited by sections 213.150 to 213.188 or because such person has filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted in accordance with sections 213.150 to 213.188; (3) For the state or any political subdivision of this state to discriminate in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, disability, or familial status; or (4)  To discriminate in any manner against any person because of such person's association with an individual protected by sections 213.150 to 213.188. 213.167. 1.  Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice may make, sign, and file with the commission a verified complaint in writing, within one hundred eighty days of the alleged act of discrimination, which shall state the name and address of the person alleged to have committed the unlawful discriminatory housing practice and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and such other information as may be required by the commission. The complainant's agent, attorney, or the attorney general may, in like manner, make, sign, and file such complaint. 2.  Any complaint that is filed with a federal agency with which the commission has a work-sharing or deferral agreement, or with a local commission that has been certified as substantially equivalent by the commission, shall be deemed filed with the commission on the date that such complaint is received by such federal agency or local commission. A copy of all complaints filed with a local commission with the authority to enforce  the  provisions  of  sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall  be  forwarded  to  the commission within seven days of the filing thereof with such local commission.  If a local commission  has  jurisdiction  to  hear  a  complaint  filed  with  the  commission,  such complaint shall be deemed to have been filed with the local commission on the date on which such complaint was filed with the commission. The commission shall, within seven days of the receipt of a complaint that a local commission has jurisdiction to hear, forward a copy thereof to such local commission. 3. After  the  filing  of  any  complaint,  the  executive  director  shall,  with  the assistance of the commission's staff, promptly investigate the complaint, and if the executive  director  determines  after  the  investigation  that  probable  cause  exists  for crediting  the  allegations  of  the  complaint,  the  executive  director  shall  immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful discriminatory housing practice complained of by HB 2000 conference, conciliation, and persuasion and shall report the results to the commission. The investigation, determination of probable cause, and conciliation shall be conducted according to such rules, regulations, and guidelines as the commission shall prescribe. 4. A person who is not named as a respondent in a complaint but who is identified as a respondent in the course of investigation may be joined as an additional or  substitute  respondent  upon  written  notice  under  such  rules,  regulations,  and guidelines as the commission shall prescribe.  Such notice, in addition to complying with the requirements of such rules, regulations, and guidelines, shall also state the reason the person to whom the notice is addressed has been joined as a party. 5.  In a case of failure to eliminate such discriminatory practice as found in the investigation,  if  the  chair  of  the  commission  deems  it  warranted  under  the circumstances,  there  shall  be  issued  and  served  in  the  name  of  the  commission  a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, as it may have been amended, requiring  the  person  named  in  the  complaint,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the \""respondent\"", to answer the charges of the complaint at a hearing, at a time and place to be specified in the notice, before a panel of at least three members of the commission, sitting as the commission, or before a hearing examiner licensed to practice law in this state who shall be appointed by the executive director and approved by the commission.  The place of the hearing shall be in the office of the commission or such other place designated by it, except that if the respondent so requests, in writing, the hearing shall be held in the county of such respondent's residence or business location at the time of the alleged unlawful discriminatory housing practice.  A copy of the notice shall also be served on the complainant. 6.  If a written notice of hearing has been issued and a party has not elected to proceed in circuit court as set forth in section 213.170, the procedures set forth for a hearing in this section and in chapter 536 shall apply. 7.  The commission shall be a party to the action and shall be represented before the panel or the hearing examiner by the office of the attorney general or, if so delegated by  the  attorney  general,  a  staff  attorney  of  the  commission. Neither  the  hearing examiner nor any member of the panel shall have participated in the investigation of the complaint.  Evidence concerning endeavors at conciliation shall be excluded. 8. The respondent may file a written verified answer to the complaint and appear at the hearing, in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, and submit testimony.  At the discretion of the hearing examiner or the panel, the complainant may be allowed to intervene, thereby becoming a party to the action with the right to present testimony in person or by counsel, provided the complainant at all times shall be treated as a party for the purpose of discovery and the taking of depositions.  The commission HB 2000 or complainant intervenor shall have the power to reasonably and fairly amend any complaint,  and  the  respondent  shall  have  like  power  to  amend  any  answer. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and be transcribed. 9. In any contested case before the commission, any party may take and use written interrogatories, make and use requests for production of documents and other materials, make and use requests for admissions, and utilize all other forms of discovery authorized by the rules of civil procedure in the same manner, upon, and under the same conditions, and upon the same notice, as is or may hereafter be provided for with respect to interrogatories, requests for production, requests for admissions, and all other forms of discovery authorized by rules of civil procedure in civil actions in the circuit  court. The  panel  or  hearing  examiner  shall  have  the  authority  to  impose sanctions in the same manner as set forth in the rules of civil procedure. 10.  The hearing shall be conducted in the manner provided by chapter 536. 11.  If the case is heard by a panel of the commission, the chair of the commission shall select the hearing panel and the presiding officer.  The presiding officer shall have full authority to call and examine witnesses, admit or exclude evidence, and rule upon all motions and objections.  The panel shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and if, upon all the evidence at the hearing, the panel finds: (1) That  a  respondent  has  engaged  in  an  unlawful  discriminatory  housing practice, the commission shall issue and cause to be served on the respondent an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the unlawful discriminatory housing practice.  The order shall require the respondent to take such affirmative action as the panel  judges  necessary  to  implement  the  purposes  of  sections  213.150  to  213.188 including, but not limited to, the extension of full, equal, and unsegregated housing; extension of a commercial real estate loan or other financial assistance; extension or restoration of membership or participation in any multiple listing service or other real estate service organization or facility; payment of actual damages; and the submission of a report of the manner of compliance; or (2)  That a respondent has engaged or is about to engage in a violation of section 213.152, 213.158, 213.161, or 213.164 to the extent that the alleged violation of section 213.164 relates to or involves a violation of one or more of such other sections or relates to or involves the encouraging, aiding, or abetting of a violation of such other sections, the  commission  may,  in  addition  to  the  relief  provided  in  subdivision  (1)  of  this subsection, assess a civil penalty against the respondent, for the purpose of vindicating the public interest: HB 2000 (a)  In an amount not exceeding two thousand dollars if the respondent has not been  adjudged  to  have  violated  one  or  more  of  the  sections  enumerated  in  this subdivision within five years of the date of the filing of the complaint; (b)  In an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed one violation of the sections enumerated in this subdivision within five years of the date on which the complaint is filed; or (c)  In an amount not exceeding ten thousand dollars if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed two or more prior violations of the sections enumerated in this subdivision within seven years of the date on which the complaint is filed. All civil penalties set forth in this subsection shall be paid to the human rights fund. 12. If, upon all the evidence, the panel finds that a respondent has not engaged in any unlawful discriminatory housing practice, the panel shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant and respondent an order dismissing the complaint. 13. If the case is heard by a hearing examiner, the examiner shall have all powers described in subdivision (8) of subsection 1 of section 213.030 and subsection 11 of this section for the purpose of the hearing. The hearing examiner shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall recommend to the commission an order granting such relief as provided in subsection 11 of this section or dismissing the complaint as to the respondent  as  provided  in  subsection  12  of  this  section,  in  accordance  with  such findings. 14. A  panel  of  at  least  three  members  of  the  commission,  sitting  as  the commission, shall review the record, findings, and recommended order of the hearing examiner.  The panel shall thereafter accept or amend the recommended order, which shall become the order of the commission. All orders shall be served on the complainant and respondent, and copies of all orders shall be delivered to the attorney general and such other public officers as the commission deems proper. 15.  No order of the commission issued in accordance with this section shall affect any contract, sale, encumbrance, or lease consummated before the issuance of such order and involving a bona fide purchaser without actual notice of the charge filed under this section. 16. Any person aggrieved by an order of the commission may appeal as provided in chapter 536. 213.170. 1. When a written notice of hearing is issued alleging a violation of section 213.152, 213.158, 213.161, or 213.164, a complainant or respondent may elect to have the claims asserted in that complaint decided in a civil action under the provisions HB 2000 of this section in lieu of a hearing under the provisions of section 213.167. Written notice of an election made under this subsection shall be filed with the commission and all parties within twenty days of the date on which the written notice of hearing is placed in the mail by the commission staff. 2.  If a party elects under the provisions of this section to have the claims asserted in  a  written  notice  issued  by  the  chair  decided  in  a  civil  action,  the  chair  shall immediately  direct  staff  attorneys  employed  by  the  commission  to  commence  and maintain a civil action on behalf of the complainant.  Such action shall be commenced within thirty days of the election.  All expenses of the claimant related to a civil action brought under this section shall be paid by the commission. 3.  Any person aggrieved with respect to the issues to be determined in a civil action instituted under this section may intervene as of right in a civil action. 4. In a  civil  action instituted  under this section, if  the court finds that an unlawful discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant all relief as set forth in section 213.185.  If monetary relief is sought for the benefit of an aggrieved person who is not a party to the civil action, the court shall not award such relief if such person has not complied with discovery orders issued by the court. 5. The  commission  shall  have  authority  to  hire  such  attorneys  as  may  be necessary to perform duties assigned to it under this section. 213.173. 1.  During the period beginning with the filing of a complaint under section 213.167 and ending with the filing of a charge, setting of a complaint for hearing, or dismissal of a complaint under the provisions of that section, the executive director and the commission staff shall, to the extent feasible, engage in settlement or conciliation with respect to the complaint.  Any settlement and conciliation agreement negotiated during such period shall be an agreement between the complainant and respondent and shall be subject to approval by the executive director. Nothing said or done in the course of settlement or conciliation under this section shall be made public or used as evidence in any subsequent proceeding under sections 213.150 to 213.188 without the written consent of the complainant and respondent. 2.  If a complaint is filed alleging a violation of section 213.152, 213.158, 213.161, or 213.164: (1)  During the investigation, the public shall not have access to records relating to the complaint, nor shall any information relating thereto be released to the public; (2)  During the investigation, the complainant and respondent shall have access to only those records that they have personally provided, until the point at which disclosure is allowed at a hearing; however, if a request for civil action is made under HB 2000 section 213.185, the complainant and respondent shall have access to those records under applicable federal, state, or local discrimination laws that require disclosure; (3) After  closure  of  a  complaint,  the  public  shall  have  access  to  only  the complaint  and  closure  documents  by  agreement  between  the  complainant  and respondent; (4) Excluding a finding of probable cause, after an investigation closure, the complainant  and  respondent  shall  have  access  to  the  investigative  file,  except  for sensitive or confidential records and records relating to witnesses who have requested anonymity. With respect to records that the commission has obtained from other government  agencies,  the  commission  shall  observe  any  statutory  confidentiality provisions imposed on the originating agencies; (5)  After failure of conciliation attempts, the complainant and respondent shall have access to copies of the investigative file, except for sensitive or confidential records and records relating to witnesses who have requested anonymity; and (6) Any settlement or conciliation agreement entered into by the complainant and respondent shall be made public unless the parties thereto agree otherwise and the executive director determines that disclosure is not required to further the purposes of sections 213.150 to 213.188. 3. To achieve the purposes of sections 213.150 to 213.188, the provisions of subsection 2 of this section shall not apply to disclosure of information to representatives of interested federal, state, or local civil or human rights agencies. 213.176. 1.  All final decisions, settlement agreements, conciliation agreements, findings, rules, and orders of the commission under any provision of sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall be in writing. Parties to proceedings shall each be sent a copy of the commission's decision and order in the proceedings. 2.  Any person who is aggrieved by a final decision, finding, rule, or order of the commission may obtain judicial review by filing a petition in the circuit court of the county of proper venue within thirty days after the commission's final decision has been made known. 3.

On such a petition, the inquiry of the court shall be limited to a determination of whether the action of the commission  is  in  excess  of  its  statutory  authority  or  jurisdiction  and  whether  the respondent has substantially complied with the order of the commission. 5.  If no proceeding for judicial review is filed within the time established under subsection 2 of this section and the commission has not filed a petition for enforcement of its order in the circuit court, any person entitled to relief may, after the expiration of sixty days from the date of the commission's order, file a petition for enforcement of the commission's decision in a circuit court having proper venue thereof.

The provisions of sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall be construed to accomplish the purposes thereof, and any law inconsistent with any provision of sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall not apply. Nothing contained in sections 213.150 to 213.188 shall be deemed to repeal any of the provisions of any law of this state relating to discrimination  because  of  race,  color,  religion,  national  origin,  sex,  ancestry,  age, disability, or familial status. 213.185. 1. If, after the filing of a complaint under section 213.152, 213.158, 213.161, or 213.164, the person claiming to be aggrieved so requests in writing, the commission shall issue to the person claiming to be aggrieved a letter indicating his or her right to bring a civil action within ninety days of such notice against the respondent named in the complaint.  Such an action may be brought in any circuit court in any county  in  which  the  unlawful  discriminatory  housing  practice  is  alleged  to  have occurred, either before a circuit or associate circuit judge.  Upon issuance of this notice, the commission shall terminate all proceedings relating to the complaint. No person may file or reinstate a complaint with the commission after the issuance of a notice under this section relating to the same practice or act.

The provisions of this section and sections 510.261 and 510.263 shall not apply to civil  actions  brought  under  section213.111  213.185  that  allege  a  violation  of  section 213.040, 213.045, 213.050, or 213.070, to the extent that the alleged violation of section 213.070  relates  to  or  involves  a  violation  of  section  213.040,  213.045,  or  213.050,  or subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 213.070 as it relates to housing 213.152, 213.158, 213.161, or 213.164. 213.040. 1.  It shall be an unlawful housing practice: (1)  To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, to refuse  to  negotiate  for  the  sale  or  rental  of,  to  deny  or  otherwise  make unavailable, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status; (2) To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status; (3) To  make,  print,  or  publish,  or  cause  to  be  made,  printed,  or published any notice, statement or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status, or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination; (4)  To represent to any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status that any dwelling is not available  for  inspection,  sale,  or  rental  when  such  dwelling  is  in  fact  so available; (5) To induce or attempt to induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood  of  a  person  or  persons  because  of  a  particular  race,  color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status; HB 2000 (6) To discriminate in the sale or rental of, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a disability of: (a)  That buyer or renter; (b)  A person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or (c)  Any person associated with that buyer or renter; (7) To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a disability of: (a)  That person; (b)  A person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or (c)  Any person associated with that person. 2. For purposes of this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050, discrimination includes: (1)  A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person with the disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a modification on the renter's agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted; (2)  A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or (3) In  connection  with  the  design  and  construction  of  covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, a failure to design and construct those dwellings in such a manner that: (a) The public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily accessible to and usable by persons with a disability; (b) All  the  doors  designed  to  allow  passage  into  and  within  all premises within such dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons with a disability in wheelchairs; and (c)  All premises within such dwellings contain the following features of adaptive design: a.  An accessible route into and through the dwelling; b. Light  switches,  electrical  outlets,  thermostats,  and  other environmental controls in accessible locations; c.  Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and d. Usable  kitchens  and  bathrooms  such  that  an  individual  in  a wheelchair can maneuver about the space. 3.  As used in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, the term \""covered multifamily dwelling\"" means: (1)  Buildings consisting of four or more units if such buildings have one or more elevators; and HB 2000 (2)  Ground floor units in other buildings consisting of four or more units. 4. Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American National  Standard  for  Buildings  and  Facilities  providing  accessibility  and usability  for  people  with  physical  disabilities,  commonly  cited  as  \""ANSI A117.1\"", suffices to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section. 5.  Where a unit of general local government has incorporated into its laws the requirements set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, compliance with such laws shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of  that  subdivision. Such  compliance  shall  be  subject  to  the  following provisions: (1)  A unit of general local government may review and approve newly constructed  covered  multifamily  dwellings  for  the  purpose  of  making determinations as to  whether the design  and construction requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section are met; (2)  The commission shall encourage, but may not require, the units of local government to include in their existing procedures for the review and approval of newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings, determinations as to whether the design and construction of such dwellings are consistent with subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, and shall provide technical assistance to units of local government and other persons to implement the requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section; (3) Nothing  in  this  chapter  shall  be  construed  to  require  the commission to review or approve the plans, designs or construction of all covered dwellings, to determine whether the design and construction of such dwellings are consistent with the requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section. 6.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit any law of the state or political subdivision of the state, or other jurisdiction in which this chapter shall be effective, that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed  in  a manner that  affords persons  with disabilities  greater access than is required by this chapter. 7.  Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others. 8.  Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 limits the applicability  of  any  reasonable  local  or  state  restriction  regarding  the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling, nor does any provision in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older persons. 9.  As used in this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050, \""housing for older persons\"" means housing: (1)  Provided under any state or federal program that the commission determines is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons, as defined in the state or federal program; HB 2000 (2)  Intended for, and solely occupied by, persons sixty-two years of age or older; or (3)  Intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person fifty- five years of age or older per unit. In determining whether housing qualifies as housing for older persons under this subsection, the commission shall develop regulations which require at least the following factors: (a) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities and services is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons; and (b) That at least eighty percent of the units are occupied by at least one person fifty-five years of age or older per unit; and (c) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons fifty-five years of age or older. 10. Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons by reason of: (1)  Persons residing in such housing as of August 28, 1992, who do not meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section,  provided  that  new  occupants  of  such  housing  meet  the  age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section; or (2) Unoccupied  units,  provided  that  such  units  are  reserved  for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section. 11.  Nothing in this section or section 213.045 or 213.050 shall prohibit conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of  competent  jurisdiction  of  the  illegal  manufacture  or  distribution  of  a controlled substance, as defined by section 195.010. 12. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a religious organization, association, or society, or any nonprofit institution or organization operated, supervised or controlled by or in conjunction with a religious organization, association, or society, from limiting the sale, rental or occupancy of dwellings which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose to persons of the  same  religion,  or  from  giving  preference  to  such  persons,  unless membership  in  such  religion  is  restricted  on  account  of  race,  color,  or national origin. Nor shall anything in this chapter prohibit a private club not in fact open to the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides  lodging  which  it  owns  or  operates  for  other  than  a  commercial purpose, from limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodging to its members or from giving preference to its members. 13. Nothing  in  this  chapter,  other  than  the  prohibitions  against discriminatory advertising in subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section, shall apply to: (1) The  sale  or  rental  of  any  single  family  house  by  a  private individual owner, provided the following conditions are met: (a)  The private individual owner does not own or have any interest in more than three single family houses at any one time; and HB 2000 (b)  The house is sold or rented without the use of a real estate broker, agent or salesperson or the facilities of any person in the business of selling or renting  dwellings  and  without  publication,  posting  or  mailing  of  any advertisement. If the owner selling the house does not reside in it at the time of the sale or was not the most recent resident of the house prior to such sale, the exemption in this section applies to only one such sale in any twenty- four-month period; or (2)  Rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his or her residence. 213.041. 1. No  declaration  or  other  governing  document  of  a homeowners' association shall include a restrictive covenant in violation of section 213.040. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or provision of the governing documents, the board of directors of a homeowners' association shall  amend,  without  approval  of  the  owners,  any  declaration  or  other governing document that includes a restrictive covenant in violation of section 213.040, and shall restate the declaration or other governing document without the  restrictive  covenant  but  with  no  other  change  to  the  declaration  or governing document. 3. If  after  providing  written  notice  to  a  homeowners'  association requesting that the association delete a restrictive covenant in violation of section 213.040, and the association fails to delete the restrictive covenant within thirty days of receiving the notice, the Missouri commission on human rights, a city or county in which a common interest development is located, or any  person  may  bring  an  action  against  the  homeowners'  association  for injunctive  relief  to  enforce  the  provisions  of  subsections  1  and  2  of  this section. The court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party. 4.  The provisions of this section shall become effective on January 1, 2006. 213.045. It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  bank,  building  and  loan association,  insurance  company  or  other  corporation,  association,  firm  or enterprise  whose  business  consists  in  whole  or  in  part  in  the  making  of commercial real estate loans, to deny a loan or other financial assistance because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability or familial status to a person applying therefor for the purpose of purchasing, construction,  improving,  repairing,  or  maintaining  a  dwelling,  or  to discriminate against him in fixing of the amount, interest rate, duration or other terms or conditions of such loan or other financial assistance, because of the race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status of such person or of any person associated with him in connection with such loan or other financial assistance, or of the present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupants, of the dwellings in relation to which such loan or other financial assistance is to be made or given. HB 2000 213.050. It  shall  be  unlawful  to  deny  any  person  access  to  or membership or participation in any multiple listing service, real estate brokers' organization or other service organization, or facility relating to the business of selling or renting dwellings, because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, or familial status. 213.076. 1. When a written notice of hearing is issued alleging violation of section 213.040, 213.045, 213.050, or 213.070, to the extent that the alleged violation of section 213.070 relates to or involves violation of one or more of such other sections or relates to or involves the encouraging, aiding or abetting of violation of such sections, a complainant or respondent may elect to have the claims asserted in that complaint decided in a civil action under  the  provisions  of  this  section  in  lieu  of  a  hearing  pursuant  to  the provisions of section 213.075.  Written notice of an election made pursuant to this subsection shall be filed with the commission and all parties within twenty days of the date on which the written notice of hearing is placed in the mail by the commission staff. 2.  Where a party has made an election pursuant to the provisions of this section, to have the claims asserted in a written notice issued by the chairperson, decided in a civil action, the chairperson shall immediately direct staff attorneys employed by the commission to commence and maintain a civil action on behalf of the complainant.  Such action shall be commenced within thirty days of the election. All expenses of the claimant related to a civil action brought under this section shall be paid by the commission. 3.  Any person aggrieved with respect to the issues to be determined in a civil action instituted pursuant to this section may intervene as of right in a civil action. 4.  In a civil action instituted pursuant to this section, if the court finds that an unlawful discriminatory practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant all relief as set forth in section 213.111.  If monetary relief is sought for benefit of an aggrieved person who is not a party to the civil action, the court shall not award such relief if such person has not complied with discovery orders issued by the court. 5.  The commission shall have authority to hire such attorneys as may be necessary to perform duties assigned to it pursuant to this section. 213.112.  Legally permissible actions pursuant to section 441.020 are subject to the provisions of this chapter only if a primary motive for the section 441.020 action is not any of the factors listed in section 441.020. ?""",Bill,2024-01-02 23:15:18.980000000,Modifies provisions relating to unlawful discriminatory practices and establishes the Missouri Fair Housing Act,D,HB2000,N,N,MO,Modifies provisions relating to unlawful discriminatory practices and establishes the Missouri Fair Housing Act,Introduced
