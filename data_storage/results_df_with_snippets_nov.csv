Kelly O’Connor, 58, of East Lansing, was charged in Clinton County with second-degree vulnerable adult abuse, a four-year felony, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Tuesday.  At the time she died, the victim was under O’Connor’s care at Vista Springs Imperial Park at Timber Ridge, an assisted living facility in Clinton County where O’Connor was employed.  O’Connor is accused of twice observing the woman attempt to go outside without appropriate attire in the very early morning hours of Dec. 23, 2022. The alleged neglect occurred during a blizzard with single-digit temperatures, subzero windchill, and blowing and drifting snow.  A snowplow driver found the victim in the parking lot around 7 a.m., partially buried in snow and it is unknown precisely how long she was outside before she was found, Nessel said.  She was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital but died due to hypothermia shortly after arrival.  O’Connor is accused of recklessly failing to act to prevent the victim from going outdoors into the storm, resulting in her death, Nessel said.  “Caregivers have a responsibility under the law to act in the face of grave danger to a vulnerable person in their care,” Nessel said in a statement. “I want to thank the Bath Township Police Department for their partnership during the investigation of this tragic case.”  O’Connor was arraigned on Nov. 20. Bond was set at $5,000. A probable cause conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Nov. 30."

(Marshall Gorby/Dayton Daily News via AP) MARSHALL GORBY /AP  A gunman opened fire Monday evening inside a Walmart in Ohio and wounded four people before killing himself -- the second shooting in 24 hours to take place at a store operated by the retail giant.  The attack at the Walmart in Beavercreek, a suburb of Dayton, just days before Thanksgiving injured four shoppers: three women and a man. Police said three were in stable condition and one of the women in critical but stable condition on Tuesday afternoon at area hospitals.  Authorities declined to release the identities of the victims, including their races, saying they had not ruled out that the attack was racially motivated.  “Tragedy struck our beloved community Monday evening, and, in the face of adversity, the strength of our community shines through,” Beavercreek Mayor Bob Stone said during a Tuesday news conference.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  Walmart said it was working closely with investigators to try to determine why the shooter, identified as 20-year-old Benjamin Charles Jones, of Dayton, opened fire.  Police said Jones entered the store at about 8:30 p.m. Monday wielding a Hi-Point 45-caliber Carbine long gun. He shot an undetermined number of rounds, leaving injured victims throughout the building, before turning the weapon on himself, authorities said.  Efforts made by The Associated Press to reach relatives of Jones were unsuccessful.  “We’re heartbroken by what’s happened at our Beavercreek, Ohio store. This remains a developing situation, and we’re working closely with investigators on the scene,” Walmart said in a statement.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  Christopher Suffron told WHIO-TV in Dayton that he was shopping with his wife when they heard five or six shots ring out. “I turned around and told her to get behind me,” he said.  Suffron said he then saw the shooter about 10 feet away and the couple ran out of the store through nearby receiving doors. As they escaped, he said he heard another five or six shots.  The shooting happened almost exactly one day after a man shot and killed a woman before fatally shooting himself outside a Walmart in Anchorage, Alaska. Police in Anchorage said Tuesday it was a domestic-violence related crime. They said in a statement no one else was involved.  Both shootings came nearly a year after a Walmart supervisor in Chesapeake, Virginia, fatally shot six employees two days before Thanksgiving.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  Walmart, which has police outposts in some of its 4,600 locations nationwide, has taken steps over the years to address gun violence. The retailer based in Bentonville, Arkansas, launched a computer-based active shooter training in 2015 that focused on three pillars: avoid the danger, keep your distance and lastly, defend.  Then in 2019, after a white gunman killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in a racist attack that targeted Hispanic shoppers, Walmart discontinued sales of certain kinds of ammunition. It also asked that customers no longer openly carry firearms in its stores. The retailer now sells only hunting rifles and related ammunition.  “We take a comprehensive approach to promoting a safe shopping and work environment—including policies, training, monitoring, and response—as well as regular reviews of security protocols and practices,” Joe Pennington, a company spokesperson, said in a statement. “While we don’t publicly discuss security measures we take in our stores, the safety of our associates and customers is a top priority.”  The store in Ohio where Monday’s shooting took place was the scene of a fatal shooting involving police almost 10 years ago. A white police officer shot 22-year-old John Crawford III after he picked up an unpackaged pellet rifle he found on a shelf in August 2014. The family of the Black man reached a settlement of $1.7 million with the city of Beavercreek. The settlement included changes in police policy.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  Beavercreek Mayor Stone said Monday's shooting brought the earlier case to mind.  “It can't help but bring back memories,” he said. “You know, it's a tragedy all in itself, though, and this is the tragedy we are grieving for, and it's a shame in this way that it has to be compared to the previous shooting.”  ___  Smyth reported from Columbus and Seewer from Toledo.

A witness later told police that the driver of the Pontiac, a 57-year-old woman from Grayling, told him someone had crashed into her car near Passenheim Road and Old 27 Highway.  The woman then allegedly became belligerent and eventually got out of the vehicle while it was still running and in drive.

Gipson and Councilmember Tim McOsker, who represent the area where the shooting occurred, released a joint statement calling for transparency by the highway patrol.  “The video of this shooting is deeply disturbing,” Bradford said. “This appears to be an unnecessary use of deadly force. The community deserves answers. If the roles were reversed, people would be immediately calling for murder charges. I call on the California Highway Patrol and the Department of Justice to be transparent and for the community to be calm and patient during the investigation.”"
Alabama police chief says department policies violated in fatal shooting of Black man outside home,2023-11-20,2023-11-27T23:34:09Z,en,amsterdamnews.com,https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/11/20/alabama-police-chief-says-department-policies-violated-in-fatal-shooting-of-black-man-outside-home/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127233409id_/https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/11/20/alabama-police-chief-says-department-policies-violated-in-fatal-shooting-of-black-man-outside-home/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127233409/https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/11/20/alabama-police-chief-says-department-policies-violated-in-fatal-shooting-of-black-man-outside-home/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGFtc3RlcmRhbW5ld3MpL25ld3MvMjAyMy8xMS8yMC9hbGFiYW1hLXBvbGljZS1jaGllZi1zYXlzLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtcG9saWNpZXMtdmlvbGF0ZWQtaW4tZmF0YWwtc2hvb3Rpbmctb2YtYmxhY2stbWFuLW91dHNpZGUtaG9tZQ~~,"An Alabama police chief said he believes department policies were violated when officers shot and killed a man during a dispute with a tow truck driver, but did not elaborate on what those policies were. Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion wrote in a statement Friday that the department has completed an internal investigation into the Sept. 29 shooting of Steve Perkins. The fatal shooting of the Black man in front of his own home has drawn regular protests in the north Alabama city. Perkins, 39, was killed by a police officer as officers accompanied a tow truck driver trying to repossess Perkinsâ truck. The Decatur Police Department said in an initial public statement that officers were called to the scene by the tow truck driver, who said the homeowner pulled a gun. Police said that the man, identified as Perkins, later threatened the driver and âturned the gun toward one of the officers.â Perkins’ family has disputed the police version of events. âI found reason to believe that policies were violated and the final report and findings were sent to the Legal Department and outside counsel late this afternoon to prepare the formal documents to move forward the discipline process,â Pinion wrote in a statement. Pinion said the city’s mayor will conduct a review and âmake a final determination if discipline is warranted and to what extent.â He said the officer who fired the shots remains on administrative leave. The department has not released the name or race of the officer. Video from a neighborâs home surveillance camera video, published by WAFF, captured the shooting. The video shows the tow truck back into the driveway. An officer is heard shouting, âPolice, get on the ground,â and shots are immediately fired in rapid succession. Police have not released body-camera footage of the shooting. An attorney representing the Perkins family, told The Associated Press last month that Perkins did not appear aware that officers were there before they immediately opened fire on him. Perkinsâ family issued a statement saying the truck payments were up to date so the truck shouldnât have been towed. Perkins’ brother, Nick Perkins, told WAFF that there is a “slight sense of relief” to hear the police chief acknowledge that policies were broken, but that the investigation has taken too long. âWeâve seen the cameras. Weâve seen the video footage,” Nick Perkins said. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is investigating the shooting. âThis has been a very painful chapter for Decatur and I recognize healing will not occur for many until after all information that can be released has been made public and all determinations on violation of policy and state law completed and potential litigation resolved,â Pinion wrote."
QB Jordan Travis says his Florida State career is over after leg injury,2023-11-20,2023-11-27T19:35:35Z,en,mlive.com,https://www.mlive.com/sports/2023/11/qb-jordan-travis-says-his-florida-state-career-is-over-after-leg-injury.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127193535id_/https://www.mlive.com/sports/2023/11/qb-jordan-travis-says-his-florida-state-career-is-over-after-leg-injury.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127193535/https://www.mlive.com/sports/2023/11/qb-jordan-travis-says-his-florida-state-career-is-over-after-leg-injury.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1saXZlKS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMy8xMS9xYi1qb3JkYW4tdHJhdmlzLXNheXMtaGlzLWZsb3JpZGEtc3RhdGUtY2FyZWVyLWlzLW92ZXItYWZ0ZXItbGVnLWluanVyeS5odG1s,"One of college football’s top quarterbacks will miss the remainder of the season. Florida State’s Jordan Travis said in a statement released Monday that his career in Tallahassee is over after he suffered a left leg injury against North Alabama on Saturday. Travis, a fourth-year starter for the Seminoles, was named a semifinalist for the Davey O’Brien Award given to the top quarterback in college football last week. He has 27 total touchdowns this season and has thrown for more than 2,755 yards for the 11-0 Noles. “I truly cannot thank everyone enough for the many thoughts, prayers and messages that have been sent my way,” Travis wrote in a statement. “I have been overwhelmed by the support from my teammates, coaches, the Florida State community and those all around the world.” “Although the injury (on Nov. 18) marks the end of my Seminole playing career, the great memories created here at FSU will never fade. Being the quarterback here at Florida State University has been a dream come true. I am humbled, honored and forever grateful. The journey this team set out on is not over yet as all of our goals still lie just ahead. I am excited to be by my brothers’ sides every day as we continue our attack. We’re all we got, we’re all we need. Job’s not finished. Go Noles!” Travis’ left leg was placed in an air cast as he was carted off the field late in the first quarter following a run up the middle. TV footage showed his leg bending at an awkward angle underneath him as he landed on the turf. Trainers immediately rushed on the field to aid Travis as concerned teammates looked on. Travis posted several updates from the hospital to his Instagram account on Sunday, showing several teammates and coaches visiting his room. Junior Tate Rodemaker will likely replace Travis moving forward as they look to win an ACC title and clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. He threw for 217 yards and two touchdowns as the Seminoles scored 58 unanswered points to beat North Alabama. Florida State finishes its regular season at rival Florida on Saturday before playing Louisville in the ACC Championship on Dec. 2.

Above Beyond: Gen X,2023-11-20,2023-11-27T23:36:46Z,en,cityandstateny.com,https://www.cityandstateny.com/power-lists/2023/11/above-beyond-gen-x/392045/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127233646id_/https://www.cityandstateny.com/power-lists/2023/11/above-beyond-gen-x/392045/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231127233646/https://www.cityandstateny.com/power-lists/2023/11/above-beyond-gen-x/392045/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGNpdHlhbmRzdGF0ZW55KS9wb3dlci1saXN0cy8yMDIzLzExL2Fib3ZlLWJleW9uZC1nZW4teC8zOTIwNDU~,"Publisher's Section Above & Beyond: Gen X How the MTV generation has kept rocking in New York. Generation X is moving on up to the East Side, West Side and leafy suburbs â to deluxe apartments in the sky and the corridors of power. Theyâre in the big leagues and getting their turn at bat. These erstwhile latchkey kids thought nothing of riding around in the way back of station wagons, grew up with after-school specials and learned that a frying egg is their brain on drugs. The so-called MTV generation experienced the rise of hip-hop, punk and grunge, got hooked on Atari and spent countless hours at the mall. But while this generation â made up of individuals born between 1965 and 1980 â may not be as outspoken as baby boomers or as social media savvy as younger generations, donât mistake this silence for compliance. Gen Xers are just doing it their way. Gen Xers lived through the end of the Vietnam War and the Cold War, the 9/11 attacks, three more wars, the Great Recession, an increasingly divided country and a global pandemic â and theyâve adjusted quite well to leading in an ever-changing world. Donât call them cynics or coffee shop slackers, because Gen X is getting stuff done. Meet the Gen Xers who are making their mark on New York. Zakiyah Ansari There were times during the coronavirus pandemic when, organizing alongside New Yorkers half her age, Zakiyah Ansari wondered if she had outstayed her welcome in New York’s activist community. “I thought, ’Maybe you’ve been doing this too long, you’re not radical enough,’” she says. But her younger colleagues told her the opposite: “There’s a level of respect for what I share. It’s a reminder that our experiences as Gen Xers can be really powerful.” That power was fully in evidence recently, as Ansari’s advocacy efforts led to success in the court battle to change New York state’s public school funding formula. For 15 years, she directed advocacy and New York City efforts for the Alliance for Quality Education. As of this month, she is co-interim executive director of the nonprofit. A mother of eight, Ansari fell into organizing after she quit her bank job to be more involved with her children’s Brooklyn schools. “My eyes were opened,” she says, watching budget cuts truncate educational offerings. “It’s not only about my child – it’s about all kids.” Ansari volunteered with what is now the New York City Coalition for Educational Justice, then joined the AQE, taking pride in galvanizing her fellow parents. “I’m a Black Muslim woman. I know how deeply the inequities exist, how some may perceive me,” she says. “But when I see other parents garner their power and understand the value of their voice – on that, there is no dollar sign.” – Hilary Danailova Jon Baldwin When Jon Baldwin looks at a standard technology – cell phone buttons, for instance – his engineer brain immediately starts imagining a better alternative, like the sensors he helped develop at Texas Instruments. “You could have a waterproof phone case, and you wouldn’t have to cut holes in the phone,” he says. “I have a lot of fun disrupting existing markets with new technology, providing an order of magnitude improvement in the way things work.” Baldwin has applied that innovative thinking to wireless communications, consumer electronics and, most recently, to automated safety enforcement at the mobility technology company Verra Mobility. As chief of government solutions, he partners with government clients to design and implement road safety technologies like red-light and speed cameras and cameras on school buses. Baldwin always knew he would be an engineer. After earning degrees in electrical engineering, however, “I figured I could solve more problems for more people by taking on larger roles in companies,” he says. He earned a master’s degree in business administration and has held leadership roles at National Semiconductor and Raytheon Technologies. While some Gen Xers are wary of the incursions of the digital age, Baldwin retains a gee-whiz appreciation for the efficiency of the internet. “Before, we had to get a pen and paper. Now we can get to a solution really quickly, and spend more energy focusing on the unsolved problems,” he says. “I’ve always had a kind of optimism – that any problem people think is impossible, technology might make it possible tomorrow.” – H.D. J.R. Cehonski Always an artist, J.R. Cehonski is as likely to be making a poster for LGBT Network as he is to be sketching in pastel. Cehonski’s best-known creations, however, are the social programs he has developed for vulnerable youth. Most recently, he launched Queens programming as regional director for the LGBT Network, a 30-year-old Long Island-based organization offering services, programming and advocacy for queer-identifying young people. Put another way, Cehonski is facilitating the support he wished he’d had while growing up in the 1990s in upstate New York. “I had to pave my own way when it came to LGBT stuff,” says Cehonski, who calls Queens his adopted home. Coming out in high school, as he did, “was not typical, as it is now.” Cehonski brought that sensitivity to the adult peer-support program he created at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. “Clinical care can be infantilizing,” says Cehonski, who studied social work at Fordham University. “Peer work is having the voice support of someone who’s been through similar circumstances.” That perspective informs his current work at LGBT Network, where Cehonski has launched programming in 200 schools citywide and created groups for transgender, Latino and other marginalized communities. He is especially proud of expanding the organization’s annual high school empowerment retreat, bringing alumni back as leadership coaches. “Seeing young people I’ve worked with, who are now successful adults,” he says, “you see how having that support and connection really does make a difference in their lives.” – H.D. Samantha Cally Conlan Over the course of her career, Samantha Cally Conlan had courted major donors for such causes as the Wildlife Conservation Society, the New York Botanical Garden and the Museum of Arts and Design. But the human suffering she saw all around her during the COVID-19 pandemic changed Conlan’s priorities. “I realize that while saving animals and plants and supporting artists are very worthwhile,” says the ace fundraiser, “for my next position, I really wanted to help people.” So last year, Conlan took over development and communications at HELP USA, a national provider of homeless services and low-income housing. She was recruited to bolster the organization’s programming, which serves 30,000 people across 60 sites in eight states and has a $150 million operating budget. The Long Island native was always drawn to bigger-picture work. She studied international affairs at Lafayette College and considered law school before becoming the Wildlife Conservation Society’s inaugural director of corporate partnerships. At the New York Botanical Garden, Conlan gave its annual fundraiser a sustainability makeover, bringing in corporate influencers around the theme “Before the Green is Gone.” Conlan drew on those experiences recently to launch HELP USA’s first annual symposium on homelessness solutions. Having raised over $50 million in her career, she could theoretically afford to relax a little, but the urgency of her mission keeps her going. “The people I work with right now are saving lives,” Conlan says. “They’re the reason I get out and do my job.” – H.D. Mariel Cruceta In the struggling South Bronx community where Mariel Cruceta grew up, “my generation was the first to flip the narrative,” she says. Cruceta’s parents came to New York from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as teenagers. They had both dropped out of school to support their families. Cruceta became the first in her family to go to college, and her own children now “have a very different experience from how I grew up,” with private school and dance classes. Along the way, Cruceta has helped thousands of other struggling New York families flip their own narratives. She coordinates shelter for the vulnerable across the metropolitan area as assistant vice president of supporting housing services for Volunteers of America-Greater New York, the organization’s largest regional affiliate. Cruceta recently led VOA’s participation in the new Street to Housing program, which fast-tracks homeless New Yorkers into permanent lodging. Partnering with several New York City agencies, Cruceta’s team helps clients bypass the shelter system by establishing housing first, then “working backwards – helping establish an income, completing housing applications,” she says. Cruceta stumbled into a social services career as a student at Hunter College, where a VOA internship fit into a schedule already crammed with multiple jobs. True to its mission, the nonprofit elevated Cruceta – supporting her through two master’s degrees – as she elevated others, both inside and outside the organization. “Life has its ups and downs,” Cruceta says. “For people having a rough time, giving them a chance is rewarding.” – H.D. Antonio Delgado New York’s lieutenant governor is a âRhodes scholar, a âRenaissance man – and a romantic. Heeding his generation’s call to follow one’s passion, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado âmoved to Los Angeles to pursue music after graduating from Harvard Law School. “Hip-hop music âis a space where you can speak truth to power, and leverage culture to inspire people,” says âDelgado, who grew up singing in his Schenectady church choir. After releasing an album, âhe returned to New York “for love,” marrying his Harvard sweetheart and launching a law career. In 2018, defying the naysayers and a Republican voter advantage, Delgado became the first person of color to win an upstate congressional seat – “and to do that with a hip-hop album,” he says, laughing. “It gives me hope that there’s always an ability to connect across difference.” Delgado brought that spirit to Washington, D.C., where 18 of his bills were signed into law, including major legislation bolstering family-owned farms. He also authored a pandemic formula allocating federal relief funds. His can-do energy caught the attention of Gov. Kathy Hochul, who selected him as her second-in-command last year. Amid rising social tensions, Delgado is proud to chair the state’s newly formed Hate and Bias Prevention Unit. The social-justice idealism that animated his early music still motivates him, now paired with a sense of generational responsibility. “We’re the last generation with a foot in the world before the internet,” he says. “It’s incumbent on us to help us collectively transition, grounded in a real set of values.” – H.D. D-Nice DJ and hip-hop star D-Nice found himself quarantining alone at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and decided to find a way to stay connected to others through music. Thus, Club Quarantine was born on Instagram. Soon he was hosting a party for 10,000, with the likes of President Joe Biden, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, former first lady Michelle Obama, Rihanna and Oprah Winfrey dropping by. “It is a great feeling that something I did became something that mattered at such a dark time,” D-Nice says. “It brought people sanity during a crazy time.” D-Nice finds hip-hop and helping communities to be two defining traits of Generation X. He says the “MTV generation” has grown up viewing a wide array of music, including hip-hop. He says that before the 1988 debut of “Yo! MTV Raps,” anyone who wanted to see hip-hop had to watch every video and style of music until the next hip-hop video came on. The show boosted hip-hop’s exposure and popularity. D-Nice cited a number of historical events – 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the societal issues the generation saw in the 1980s, including the impact of the crack cocaine epidemic – as reasons why Gen X wants to serve their communities. “We’ve seen so much,” he says. “We’re not far removed from the Civil Rights Movement. We’ve seen true devastation in our communities. All we wanted to do is give back to people.” – John Celock Timothy Foley Tim Foley remembers being the first in his family to have an email address, back in the 1990s. “Now we carry the accumulation of human knowledge in our pockets,” says Foley, a longtime political strategist. Having all that information just a tap away “makes you a much more effective advocate.” As head of the Building & Realty Institute, Foley loves being able to call up property records instantly or blast out development alerts for his membership. But he recently went old school, using Gen X pop culture references to make his point in a social media campaign promoting New York’s accessory dwelling bill. “For example, Fonzie on ‘Happy Days’ lived in a garage apartment,” Foley says. “Magnum PI lived in his friend’s guest house!” Foley himself was almost a thespian. But after moving to New York to pursue theater after college, the Massachusetts native found himself drawn instead to community activism, working on campaigns both locally and for then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama. Health care was the motivating issue for Foley, who traces his political involvement to his sister’s struggles with childhood cancer. As the political director for SEIU Healthcare, Foley helped engage physicians in the fights for health care reform and paid sick and family leave. “Both health care and housing are fundamental quality-of-life and cost-of-living issues, and major stressors for families,” he says. “They’re easy to demonize. But what inspires me is how small actions can make a huge difference.” – H.D. Beatriz Fritschler At lunchtime, Beatriz Fritschler is more likely to be strolling with a colleague than dining at a table. “I coined the term netwalking,” says the health-conscious deputy commissioner of strategic partnerships at the New York City Department of Social Services. Fritschler had spent decades in a career devoted to the care of others when a burst brain aneurysm forced her to take care of herself five years ago. After beating the odds through two surgeries, Fritschler now brings a renewed sense of purpose as she connects the city agency with its nonprofit and philanthropic partners. She collaborates with academic institutions on social policy, recruits donors for clothing and meals, and works with sponsors for cultural events “to expose our families in shelters to a better life.” Fritschler’s attraction to service was cemented by her experience emigrating at 19 from the Dominican Republic. Troubled by pervasive sexual harassment at her factory job, she realized that unlike her undocumented peers, “I had options,” Fritschler recalls. She took advantage of them – learning English and eventually earning a master’s degree in public administration from Columbia University. Determined to support women facing violence and discrimination, Fritschler raised millions for the Dominican Women’s Development Center before spending a decade at the city Human Resources Administration. Nowadays, she is also an ambassador with the Aneurysm and AVM Foundation – and with a new lease on life, Fritschler is trying to master the choreography to Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation.” “Our generation had the best music,” she says. “But I maybe need to practice a little more.” – H.D. Mathylde Frontus Tackling issues ranging from gun violence to housing insecurity, Mathylde Frontus had launched multiple Brooklyn nonprofits by the time she hit 40. So in 2018, when local leaders were seeking a candidate to fill the troubled Assembly District 46 seat, Frontus was an obvious candidate. “I thought, ‘Why not?’ I’m already serving this community,” recalls the lifelong Coney Islander. “And I’m always thinking about what I can do to move the needle on intergenerational poverty.” During two terms in office, Frontus created an economic mobility program aimed at supporting her neighbors as they launch small businesses, purchase first homes and train for careers. To continue that work, Frontus this year co-founded the nonprofit Coney Island Neighborhood Revitalization Corp., where she serves as interim executive director. It’s her latest effort to confront the social problems she first observed during her Brooklyn childhood. “I realized things didn’t have to be that way,” says Frontus, the daughter of Haitian immigrants. “I always wanted to be a vehicle for change.” To that end, she studied social work at New York University. She later earned a doctorate from Columbia University, and now teaches at both schools. In her 20s, Frontus founded Urban Neighborhood Services, a multiservice nonprofit she ran for nearly a decade. Her Coney Island Anti-Violence Collaboration is celebrating its 10th year, and she recently founded Seaside Independent Democrats to bolster Brooklyn’s leadership pipeline. “I take pride in the neighborhood,” Frontus says. “I’ve always pitched in. After all, I live here.” – H.D. Jessica Funes For Jessica Funes, military service was both a blessing and a curse. She relished the sense of mission and solidarity: “If someone cried, you cried,” she says. “When you make it through, you feel like a conqueror.” But after more than a dozen years in the U.S. Army, Funes suffered traumatic brain injury, PTSD and hearing loss. As one of just three women in her Iraq deployment division, she also felt the scorn of 10,000 male colleagues who saw her “not as equal, but as a burden.” As a veteran, however, Funes has found her niche. She now mentors hundreds of fellow service members through the CUNY Office of Veterans Affairs, providing the kind of support she yearned for but never found – and creating community through campus events and a volunteer program. Funes grew up in Queens, chafing against her Ecuadorian family’s traditional expectations. “So when the recruiter came to my door and asked, do you want to make a difference? I said yes,” Funes recalls. Then a single mom in her 20s, she was assigned to a pilot program that trained women together with men. Back home after discharge, Funes earned a master’s degree in human rights from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, where she was elected to the Salute Veterans National Honor Society. As women have become more prominent in the military, Funes’ particular passion is mentoring CUNY’s 500 female veterans: “I want to be visible and available to them,” she says. “I’m saying, ‘Hey, veterans, you have a voice.’” – H.D. Anat Gerstein Maybe because she’s the descendant of Holocaust survivors – or maybe because, as the daughter of Soviet Israeli immigrants who settled in America, she grew up between three worlds – Anat Gerstein was always drawn to social causes. “I carry that with me,” the Israel-born Gerstein says of her complex heritage. From an early age, she recalls “seeing how people were treated differently through no fault of their own, circumstances they were born into – and standing up for those people.” Today, Gerstein stands up for a variety of causes through her eponymous communications firm, which works exclusively with nonprofits. Among her roughly 50 clients are many of New York City’s prominent social and human services organizations, museums, business districts and philanthropic foundations. “We have to both believe in their missions, and know we can support them in achieving their organizational goals,” Gerstein says. These include helping the city’s medical schools implement diversity initiatives, launching Girl Scouts Troop 6000 for girls in New York’s shelter system and expanding homeless and behavioral health services at a moment of rising need. Gerstein, who holds a master’s degree in public administration, learned policy as the longtime chief of staff to then-New York City Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum. “She is the most generous New Yorker,” says Gerstein of the woman she considers her mentor – and who, having introduced Gerstein to the nonprofit world, remains a client. After four decades in New York, Gerstein’s motivation hasn’t changed: “Supporting the organizations that are doing the hardest work in the city.” – H.D. David Greenfield As the leader of America’s largest Jewish-sponsored anti-poverty charity, David Greenfield makes the broad social impact he has dreamed of since childhood. Since taking the helm in 2018, Greenfield has grown the Met Council’s fundraising by 2,000%; doubled the budget, staff and clientele to 325,000 New Yorkers annually; and launched innovative programs like a digital food pantry (“think Fresh Direct, but a food pantry“). “In some respects, you can get more done as a nonprofit CEO than as a legislator,” says Greenfield, who has been both. “In government today, it’s difficult to find consensus.” Yet Greenfield credits his two terms in the New York City Council with honing his policy and fundraising savvy. In office, he raised millions for park renovations throughout his Brooklyn district, championed affordable housing and authored the Vision Zero legislation aimed at reducing road fatalities. Greenfield’s public-service impulse comes from a defining childhood incident: He was assaulted by an antisemitic mob en route to a yeshiva, and police dismissed his concerns. After studying political science, Greenfield was a corporate lawyer on 9/11 – an event that “recalibrated my thinking,” he says. “Life is short – let’s put our talents to better use for the community.” As he expands Met Council’s services to meet rising need across New York, Greenfield is still enmeshed in politics: He co-chaired Mayor Eric Adams’ transition, sits on the mayor’s advisory committee and works closely with Gov. Kathy Hochul. “I feel it’s a continuation of the work,” he says, “just in a different way.” – H.D. Suzanne Grossman Suzanne Grossman could have really used someone like her older self when, as a new graduate from Tufts University, she struggled to land a job. “I was just terrible at interviewing,” she recalls. “I had jobs that didn’t suit my skills. I was bored and frustrated. Coming through that and finding meaningful work made me want to help others find it, too.” That’s just what Grossman does for aspiring policymakers at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College in Manhattan. As deputy director of career services and alumni relations, Grossman connects the City University of New York school’s mostly first-generation students with an 8,000-strong alumni network in New York, Albany and Washington, D.C. Under her tutelage, a rising number of Marxe students each year lands career-launching awards like the New York State Excelsior and the Port Authority Leader fellowships. The New Jersey native started her own career in nonprofits focusing on girls and women before transitioning into career development, with stints at Brooklyn College and the College of Staten Island. Marxe, where she has coached young professionals for a decade, “really speaks to my values,” she says, “serving people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds who want to make a difference at all levels.” In her spare time, Grossman is a passionate Irish fiddler. After all, even when the perfect job is landed, “no one career satisfies all the parts of ourselves,” she says. “We have to find ways to engage that creative side.” – H.D. Corinne Hammons Twenty-five years ago, after starting out in the corporate world, Corinne Hammons realized her heart lay in nonprofit work. “I have a really keen sense of the importance of social justice,” says Hammons, who now leads Little Flower Children and Family Services of New York. That sensibility was shaped by growing up in Baltimore during the 1980s crack epidemic. “I saw a lot of what I felt were really unfair things – poverty, racism,” Hammons says. “I had a sense that everyone deserves better.” At Little Flower, Hammons oversees a $60 million budget as she addresses those inequities one client at a time. The 95-year-old Suffolk County-based organization serves 2,000 vulnerable youths and adults annually, offering wellness, residential treatment as well as foster and adoption services. Hammons honed what became her trauma-informed approach in her first nonprofit role, at Victim Services (now Safe Horizon). Under her guidance, Little Flower was recently designated as a sanctuary certified organization that incorporates trauma-informed care. The nonprofit also secured its first national accreditation. Looking back, Hammons is most proud of managing organizations through the crises that defined her generation: 9/11, Superstorm Sandy and the COVID-19 pandemic, when Little Flower remained open around the clock. “As a Gen X person, I was so mentored by the baby boomers who are part of the Civil Rights Movement and created all these nonprofits,” Hammons says. A quarter-century in, she takes an active role mentoring the next generation: “We are the ones in leadership positions now.” – H.D. Angel Hernandez Bronx Borough Historian Angel Hernandez has been fascinated by history as long as he can remember. At 45, he now realizes he’s a part of it. “Our generation witnessed the birth of the world that we’re living in today,” Hernandez says. “As a Latino in the Bronx, I saw it all happening.” His brothers breakdanced in the living room; fast-forward, and hip-hop is being fêted at 50, while ’90s fashions are back in style. Hernandez grew up listening to his Puerto Rico-born parents’ stories – and gazing at Edgar Allan Poe’s cottage on the Grand Concourse. Thirty years later, Hernandez was organizing audio tours of that cottage as director of programs at the Bronx County History Society, where he launched the Bronx Latino History project. Now Hernandez’s day job is overseeing government relations at the New York Botanical Garden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he launched food donation programs using crops from both the Botanical Garden and local community gardens. He is also president of the Huntington Free Library and Reading Room – another piece of Bronx history that Hernandez hopes will engage his neighbors. “You don’t have to be appointed by the Bronx borough president to be a Bronx historian,” he says. And you don’t have to live that long to be part of history. “We were born in a generation at the cusp of innovation,” Hernandez says. “We can walk by a pay phone and say, ‘I’ve made calls on that – and I can still make a call from my iWatch.’” – H.D. Kashif Hussain Kashif Hussain’s advocacy career was shaped by his immigrant experiences. As the son of South Asian parents, he grew up watching “a desert turned into paradise” as glittering towers sprouted up in Saudi Arabia, where his father moved the family to work as an architect. The experience made him realize that “infrastructure encompasses not just construction, but also potable water, energy, food – all kinds of systems for people living in concentrated areas.” As an adult in the U.S., Hussain became a grassroots activist on behalf of his Brooklyn neighbors, whose immigrant communities struggled with tenant struggles and high rates of asthma. “I realized that folks from different backgrounds, living in different neighborhoods, were experiencing the same problems,” he says. Hussain now brings those perspectives together as New York City’s deputy public advocate for infrastructure and environmental justice – one of four deputies handling social justice issues under Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. Originally thinking he would build things his father designed, Hussain earned degrees in mechanical engineering from the City University of New York. His shift to advocacy now has him working on green building standards, power generation and crisis responses to such novel environmental challenges as storm flooding and smoky air. And with the ear of New York City Council, Hussain is finally in an ideal position to solve his neighbors’ problems. “That’s the most satisfying thing,” he says. “We can’t fix it all. But we bring a smile to people’s faces every day.” – H.D. Lolita Jackson This fall, Lolita Jackson returned to her alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, to teach climate strategy. Years ago, her professors were white and male, and she was only one of six female chemical engineering majors. Now women are everywhere. “It’s like redemption – knowing I really did belong here,” Jackson says. Jackson has made a career of exceeding expectations. She became an accidental climate expert at the New York City mayor’s office, where she worked for 15 years. After being drafted to work on a post-Superstorm Sandy climate initiative, Jackson ended up serving as Mayor Bill deBlasio's chief climate diplomat. That led to her current role, leading international government relations and organizing events like U.N. Climate Week in the New York office of Sustainable Development Capital, an energy investment firm. Jackson’s science focus stems from her childhood in a New Jersey housing project. As part of the first cohort bused to an all-white school, she quickly realized to prove her intelligence to skeptical teachers that she should focus on fields where the answer was never in doubt: math and science. After college, Jackson moonlighted as a jazz singer to pay off her student loans. “I had a day job at Morgan Stanley, but singing allowed me to see the world,” she says. Jackson has sung internationally ever since, bringing the same skills to music as she does to policy: “It’s an ensemble, not a solo. You have to depend on other people – and be able to improvise.” – H.D. Christopher Johnson Hanging in public relations executive Christopher Johnson’s office is a picture of a bride posing on top of a toolbox. The Home Depot ad appeared in a special advertising section for David’s Bridal in a magazine that no longer exists. But it had an impact in the media of its day – a metaphor for the arc of Johnson’s very Gen X career, which began in the heyday of print media and flourishes in today’s social media age. Johnson has now logged nearly two decades with Geto & de Milly, a Manhattan public affairs firm. He made a splash alongside Beyoncé, promoting the opening of Brooklyn’s marquee Barclays Center. “It was a big moment – bringing this world-class facility to the borough,” says Johnson, who also worked on The New York Times headquarters. “And it was thrilling to be within a stone’s throw of Beyoncé.” As a first-grader in Manhasset, Johnson was captivated watching President Jimmy Carter’s inauguration on TV. His passion for policy later led to work on campaigns and, in college, as a staffer for then-Assembly Member Thomas DiNapoli. At Geto & de Milly, Johnson helped develop the digital and social media division and has secured key funding for local nonprofits. “Walking around the city, seeing the magnificent buildings at Columbus Circle or the Barclays Center and knowing I had a hand in that – it’s a sense of pride,” Johnson says. – H.D. Jennifer Jones Austin Nonprofit workers can thank Jennifer Jones Austin, the longtime leader of FPWA, for supporting a living wage standard. Rikers Island prisoners saw the end of solitary confinement policy thanks to the efforts of Jones Austin, who chaired the New York City Board of Correction. And tens of thousands of city families have enjoyed subsidized prekindergarten with full-day care due to Jones Austin’s work as New York City’s first family services coordinator. The Brooklyn native, who currently chairs the New York City Racial Justice Commission, is a quiet force behind some of New York’s most effective social campaigns. “When you’re a policy organization, you don’t need $100 million to have an impact,” she says. (FPWA’s budget is $8 million.) As a student at Fordham Law, Jones Austin realized policy work best suited her bigger-picture ambition. “(People) showed up in court, all affected by the same circumstances and policies, but the systems didn’t seem to work in their favor,” she says. Jones Austin has tackled that system ever since – from what she calls “the poverty-to-prison pipeline” to the injustice of nonprofit workers earning less than their clients. A veteran of the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations, she also co-hosts the weekly policy hour of “Keepin’ it Real with Al Sharpton” and the Black community radio show “Open Line.” Nowadays, Jones Austin is “trying to let go a little bit more and create that space for the next generation,” she says. “And do my best to impart whatever I’ve learned.” – H.D. Peter Kauffmann Over a quarter-century in public affairs and public service, political strategist Peter Kauffmann has been at the center of his generation’s defining events. On Sept. 12, 2001, he toured ground zero alongside then-U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, for whom he served as press secretary. Inspired “to do more” by what he saw, Kauffmann joined the Navy – and found himself on an aircraft carrier to Indonesia providing relief after a devastating 2004 tsunami. And when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down New York, then-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, an old friend, recruited Kauffmann to manage day-to-day crisis operations at City Hall. By then, Kauffmann had already founded Bluejacket Strategies, his Manhattan-based political consultancy. He had advised campaigns for Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul, and he directed communications for David Paterson. Years after he had worked on the successful effort to legalize same-sex marriage in New York, the Queens native helped pass legislation legalizing surrogacy – twin victories he considers career highlights. And he had felt his “head explode” with outrage while doing opposition research on Donald Trump. “I came of age in politics when Republicans loved this country – when Reagan defeated the Soviet Union,” Kauffmann says. “And here we were with a draft dodger siding with Russia.” It was a reminder of how much had changed since he entered politics as a White House intern in 1997. “(But) after 25 years, I’m still an idealist,” Kauffmann says. “I love being able to have a tangible impact on the world around me.” – H.D. Nabaraj KC Nabaraj KC never set out to be a “real” politician, as he calls it. “I was trying to help the community,” he says. “But if you are in power, you can do a lot more.” The Nepali-born New Yorker has proven that point over two decades as a community activist. As a member of New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ Southeast Asian Advisory Committee, KC is a City Hall liaison for his fellow Asian Americans. He served on the Queens Community Board 3 and currently heads the College Point Civic and Taxpayers Association. A natural leader, KC embodies his community’s immigrant hustle. He ran a local restaurant, several grocery stores and a cell phone boutique before embarking on a real estate career (he now serves on the board of the New York State Association of Realtors). During the coronavirus pandemic, KC coordinated and distributed $3 million in food and supplies to vulnerable neighbors – prompting Adams, then the Brooklyn borough president, to recognize him as a “Brooklyn COVID Hero” in 2021. The following year, after an unsuccessful run for the New York City Council, KC served on Adams’ mayoral transition team. He has orchestrated numerous New York festivals spotlighting South Asian culture. More recently, KC launched a foundation to raise money for the city’s fast-growing Nepali community. “I never thought that someday this poor guy all the way from afar would be able to even dream about running for City Council,” KC says. “But if I don’t take a lead, who’s going to?” – H.D. Amy Kellogg As an attorney, Amy Kellogg has had one employer – Harter Secrest & Emery, the Albany business law firm where she is a partner – and one school, Albany Law School of Union University, where she earned her degree and now teaches lobbying law. “I know my niche,” Kellogg says with a laugh. Kellogg has thrived over two decades at the intersection of law and legislation. She’s the partner in charge of the Albany office and leads her firm’s government affairs group, a practice that’s ideal, she says, “if politics is also your hobby,” which for Kellogg it is. “It can be a challenging time to love politics. But I actually do love it.” That passion has fueled Kellogg’s efforts passing hundreds of bills over the past two decades – including, notably, legislation extending a chemotherapy coverage benefit on behalf of client GSK, formerly GlaxoSmithKline. She has represented numerous licensed professionals seeking legislative tweaks around their practice regulations, and has worked on binding arbitration with unions and transit authorities. Over 20 years in practice, Kellogg has seen two big changes. One is the rise of social media: “It’s good at engaging people, but it doesn’t capture the detail you need when you’re talking about policy,” she says. The other is a more diverse new generation of policy lawyers, whom Kellogg is committed to mentoring. “I’ve been the first in many instances,” she says. “I don’t want to be the first anymore – and I don’t want others to be the first, either.” – H.D. Cathy Kim Cathy Kim’s father, a South Korean immigrant, taught her that “nothing but luck separates you from the person living on the streets,” she says. As an adult, however, Kim had an epiphany: “It’s not just luck. It’s also the resources and the network you have around you.” Ever since, this Angeleno-turned-New Yorker has sought to ensure that the less fortunate have access to those resources. She is currently chief program officer for Hot Bread Kitchen, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit that helps women – largely immigrants and people of color – train for and secure hospitality jobs and build small businesses. In two years, Kim has doubled the staff to 50 employees and implemented a strategic growth plan that quadrupled annual clients served to more than 400 in 2023. In prior roles with the New York City Housing Authority and several social services nonprofits, Kim realized “housing is just one part of a much bigger system,” she says. “Without income, you can’t afford housing.” Now working on this issue, Kim manages workforce development programs that contribute some $100 million in regional economic impact. The resourcefulness Kim learned as an immigrant’s daughter and a Gen Xer, in her view, can help bridge digital as well as cultural divides in her adopted hometown. “Change has defined our generation,” she says. “If you don’t want to be left behind, you have to embrace it – and leverage those things in service of our communities.” – H.D. Steve Kramer Whether on the mat or in the political fray, Steve Kramer has never been one to be outwrestled. At his Washington Heights high school, he was the kid nobody dared beat up “because they knew it wasn’t going to end well for them,” Kramer says. His classmates made a deal: “Don’t get in the way of our drug (sales), and we won’t get in the way of your politics.” At that point, Kramer was already a decade into his political campaigning career. He started wielding a clipboard at age 6; by 14, he was managing get-out-the-vote efforts on Manhattan’s West Side and in Connecticut, where he grew up. Former Connecticut Gov. William O’Neill wrote his college letter of recommendation. Now Kramer runs campaigns in 38 states (and occasionally overseas) with Get Out The Vote, his Manhattan-based outfit. He routinely wins races by 1 percentage point or less – and delights in toppling incumbents. Over the years, he has worked with the likes of Gov. Kathy Hochul and former White House press secretary Jen Psaki. “I’d love to have an alumni dinner, but I wouldn’t be able to afford the bar bill,” says Kramer, an inveterate party-thrower universally known by his last name. His clients are myriad, often luminary – and include both Democrats and moderate Republicans, like former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. “My criteria are, can they win? Do they represent that district? And can they afford me?” he says. “It’s a business, in addition to being a passion.” – H.D. Sharon Levy One of Sharon Levy’s favorite programs at the YMCA of Greater New York is called Teens Take the City. “It’s a magical experience,” says Levy, who heads public affairs for the 171-year-old organization. “Kids think about what they’d do better, draft legislation and visit the City Council chamber, where they actually debate bills.” The daughter of Israeli immigrants, Levy was a teen herself when she “caught the bug” for politics at Queens College. As a commuter student from Howard Beach, she was thrilled to intern at the state Senate in Albany. “That was it, there was no turning back,” she says. Back downstate, Levy worked for a governor, a New York City Council member and a member of Congress. Her grassroots instincts and deep knowledge of policy have yielded tangible benefits for the YMCA, where she handles government affairs on behalf of 24 branches serving 500,000 New Yorkers annually. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Levy helped coordinate the YMCA’s vaccination clinics, a remote-learning support program and three new food pantries. More recently, in response to increasing demand in the city’s northernmost borough, she championed the opening of two Bronx facilities. It all sounds like a lot, but Levy thinks her work ethic is typical of her generation. “We’re incredibly hardworking, and we really do believe we can have it all,” she says. “I have four kids, two dogs and a full-time job. And I’m tired. But I wouldn’t trade any of it.” – H.D. Vanessa Pino Lockel In early 2020, Vanessa Pino Lockel assumed leadership of the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk – just as the world shut down and the nonprofit faced dire funding cuts. “Not being able to meet my employees face to face, building visibility when the whole world was at a standstill – it’s been nothing but uphill,” she says. Three years later, Lockel has grown the $20 million land-grant organization from 100 to 250 permanent employees and expanded programming across 10 Long Island locations, including a 272-acre educational farm. It took a work ethic Lockel attributes to her upbringing as the daughter of a Colombian immigrant mom and to “a generation that has grit,” she says. “We were forced to figure things out for ourselves.” Case in point: When Lockel couldn’t find a job in theater, her college major, she took a temp job at JPMorgan Chase & Co. That led to finance and policy roles at the state Banking Department, the state comptroller’s office and, most recently, handling government and community affairs for the Long Island Rail Road. Lockel is also a marathon runner and a nutrition expert, so Cornell’s flagship agriculture programs resonated. Under her leadership, CCES has emphasized sustainability, most recently with a state grant for local green energy research. Lockel knows that healthy communities, like healthy bodies, are a question of priorities. “I may not be the richest or the most successful,” she says. “But I’m doing all of it. And I’d like to highlight the balance I’ve been able to pull off.” – H.D. Brandon Lorenz As the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside, Brandon Lorenz decided it was time to launch his own New York City firm. The result – Lorenz Communications & Public Affairs – brings together Lorenz’s decades of experience as a journalist, campaign professional, policy strategist and union advocate. “I’d done so many things in my career – crisis moments, advocacy campaigns,” Lorenz says. “In a consulting role, I can say, ‘I’ve seen this type of situation before.’” As a young reporter, Lorenz had noticed how his workplace differed from union newsrooms. “It was very impactful for someone trying to make it in a field where wages and benefits have never been what they should be,” he says. Years later, the Wisconsin native brought that awareness to his debut New York role – as national communications and public policy director for the Actors’ Equity Association. He negotiated a 2019 profit-sharing arrangement for its 51,000 members and, when the pandemic shut down theaters, negotiated the actors’ unemployment benefits. Lorenz had previously headed communications for the Human Rights Campaign, garnering congressional support for a comprehensive nondiscrimination bill. And he was already fluent in policy from jobs with the Wisconsin and Nebraska Democratic parties, as well as with numerous Democratic candidates. Honing those skills before social media’s instantaneous likes and clicks has proven to be an advantage. Lorenz frequently counsels younger colleagues “to pump the brakes,” as he puts it. “My inclination is to give things a little more time – which is definitely generational.” – H.D. Kelsey Louie Coming of age as a gay man from an Asian immigrant family, “I was part of several communities that needed support,” Kelsey Louie says. As a social worker and nonprofit leader, Louie has in turn provided that support to vulnerable communities across his native New York City. Louie headed GMHC, formerly Gay Men’s Health Crisis, for nearly a decade, adding supportive housing, a mental health clinic and the Terry Brenneis and David Boger Hub for Long-Term Survivors. Now Louie is expanding social services at The Door, a $40 million youth organization that serves 10,000 mostly low-income young people of color annually – including at its public charter school, Broome Street Academy. With a marginalized population that is 25% LGBTQ-identifying, The Door “wasn’t much of a departure” from GMHC, Louie says. His mission remains “to support communities – and include their voices by asking directly what they need.” As it turns out, youths need many of the same things as gay men: legal and nutrition services, supportive housing and mental health (a dedicated Door clinic is forthcoming). Louie credits his effectiveness to “managing with my MBA, but leading with my MSW,” he says. After graduating from New York University’s Silver School of Social Work, where he has since taught, Louie decided he would be a more effective leader with organizational know-how – and earned a business degree from Columbia University. “Today’s generation has turned up the volume on demands for things like equity, transparency and inclusion,” he adds. “That’s forcing us to adapt – to be better.” – H.D. Kristin Malek When Kristin Malek was in fifth grade, she saw Melanie Griffith in “Working Girl,” and it changed her life. “I wanted to wear that tweed outfit and heels and take a briefcase to work,” recalls Malek, who came from a family of stay-at-home women. In her 20s, Malek launched a corporate career in supply chain and procurement, “chasing money and just wanting to get promoted,” she says. But giving birth to a daughter with Down syndrome 14 years ago changed her priorities: “I’m still a for-profit professional, but I needed to find a way to support and advocate for marginalized communities.” And that’s how Malek became a leader in supply chain diversity. After two decades at Target, in 2017 she became the global director of business diversity at CDW – an IT provider for New York state, New York City and numerous city agencies. Malek helps clients ensure they meet their diversity investment goals. New York City, for example, has a target of 30% of contract values going to businesses owned by minorities or women. Under Malek’s guidance, in 2019 CDW was inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable – placing it among only 34 companies worldwide that have spent $1 billion dollars directly with minority- and women-owned businesses. “I often think what could have been if all the Fortune 100 were in that roundtable,” Malek says. “I think we have to keep talking about the change we want to see. Whether I’m helping women-owned, veteran-owned or disability-owned businesses, I’m still meeting my commitment to my daughter.” – H.D. Jerry McKinstry As befits a member of Generation X – a cohort that has adapted to sweeping and continuous change – Jerry McKinstry has had at least four careers, and he’s not done yet. “I’ve made the decision to reinvent myself often,” says McKinstry, currently assistant vice president of public affairs at Pace University – and a 2023 graduate of its master’s program in digital media. Drawing on his background in journalism and politics, McKinstry has doubled the university’s media mentions in four years, placing faculty in prestigious publications like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The Yonkers native was entranced by media early: His first job was delivering newspapers. Later, McKinstry worked as a Gannett reporter by day and a journalism professor by night. “Journalism was a fantastic experience; it was my master’s in life,” he says. “I loved the symbiotic relationship of doing the craft and teaching it.” As newspapers shuttered, however, McKinstry transitioned to politics. At a series of media relations outlets, he handled press for state and national campaigns; he also served as deputy communications director for Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino. “Now university life brings all my experiences together in a real synchronicity,” McKinstry says. The onetime professor was exhilarated to be back in the classroom at age 48, making documentary films alongside students 25 years his junior. “Gen X – we’re a bridge to generations,” he says. “We can bring different worlds together, with the wisdom to make an impact.” – H.D. Graciela Mochkofsky In the tiny Patagonian village where she grew up, Graciela Mochkofsky started her own magazine at age 8. It was the beginning of a career that, while spanning continents and languages, has remained devoted to community journalism. Mochkofsky, a veteran political reporter in her homeland, is now dean of the City University of New York’s Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, and the architect of a $40 million initiative partnering city advertising with local media. She came to Newmark in 2016 to launch the nation’s first Spanish-English bilingual journalism program – and has since overseen six cohorts of “pioneros,” as she calls them, who’ve gone on to populate the nation’s newsrooms just as “Spanish speakers (have become) part of the national conversation.” Mochkofsky brings a perspective shaped by a childhood under Argentina’s brutal dictatorship. “I grew up at a time of profound change and uncertainty, which forced my generation to adapt,” says Mochkofsky, who is also a contributing writer for The New Yorker. “That resilience has served me well – and helps me now, as the dean of a journalism school during a moment of huge transformation.” At Newmark, Mochkofsky oversaw the national expansion of the Center for Community Media, which supports news outlets covering immigrants and communities of color. She also launched the school’s annual Latino Media Summit. “I was shaped by people who knew that journalism is something that you fight for,” she says. “That democracy is something that you fight for – and it can go away.” – H.D. Marc Molinaro Anyone making a Gen X slacker joke never met Marc Molinaro. In 1995, at just 19, he became America’s youngest mayor – a position he held for six terms in upstate Tivoli, population 1,300. “I fixed potholes and water main breaks, picked up garbage and built parks,” says Molinaro, a Republican elected last year to Congress. While his peers were pledging fraternities, he was steeped in zoning and economic policy: “Being a village mayor, you are the person people turn to, which is both challenging and fulfilling.” Inspired by a high school program in Washington, D.C., Molinaro actually won his first election at 18, to the Tivoli Board of Trustees. Later, as a Dutchess County legislator, he wrote the Clean Indoor Air Act, which became a model for eliminating indoor smoking statewide. After a stint as the Assembly’s assistant minority leader, Molinaro spent a dozen years as Dutchess County executive, working on criminal justice reform and building a model for a community-based mental health care. He ran for Congress “because I felt they could use some upstate common sense,” he says. “I felt they could use a village mayor.” Three decades later, Molinaro draws daily on the lessons he learned back in Tivoli. “At that level, you see your decisions have real impact for real people,” he says. “My generation has lived through a lot of history really quick, and it seems to be accelerating,” he says. “But I’ve cherished every second of my last 30 years in public service.” – H.D. Eon Nichols Eon Nichols’ coworkers have noticed that when things are chaotic at the law firm of Cuddy & Feder, Nichols remains calm as a cucumber. That equanimity comes from being a Guyanese American immigrant, with a broader perspective on the travails of life. “An appreciation for what you have, even when things are bad – that’s shaped my outlook on life and on work,” says Nichols, who is now a partner in the firm’s White Plains office. When he was 8, his family settled into Queens’ Guyanese community. After college at SUNY Binghamton, Nichols studied law “because I always knew I’d go to grad school, but didn’t want to deal with blood,” he says jokingly. Nichols’ first job out of Fordham Law School was at Cuddy & Feder, and he figured he would move on after a year or two. But real estate law was just too much fun. Two decades on, he is negotiating deals like a recent nine-figure Florida transaction involving 11 buildings. But the projects closest to his heart are in his adopted Westchester community. Nichols was thrilled to facilitate a recent $275 million mixed-use development in downtown White Plains. He’s also active with the Business Council of Westchester, African American Men of Westchester and the local Burke Rehabilitation Hospital. “I enjoy dealing with a lot of different types of clients from all walks of life at this job,” Nichols says. “I always liked the area, the community, the firm. And I just grew with it.” – H.D. Jack OâDonnell It was summer 1996, and Jack O’Donnell was waiting for his post-college job to start at a government agency. Meanwhile, he impulsively hitched a ride to the Democratic National Convention – and ended up working on the Clinton-Gore campaign. He never did take that government job. “Once you’ve been on a campaign, it’s hard to go back,” says O’Donnell, now a managing partner at his government relations and public affairs firm. In the quarter-century since, O’Donnell has worked on countless campaigns. Most memorably, he worked to elect U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer in 1998 “when he was 50 points behind in the primary,” O’Donnell says. “My mother told me I should get a real job.” O’Donnell not only helped convince upstaters to elect the Brooklyn candidate, he ultimately went on to work for the senator. Last month, Schumer was back in Buffalo to announce a regional tech hub. “He’s really kept that promise to upstate New York, and I’m happy to have been part of it,” O’Donnell says. Indeed, while most of his ambitious peers have left Buffalo, O’Donnell is devoted to fortifying his home region. He recently helped secure funding for the Strong National Museum of Play’s $120 million expansion, and for the University at Buffalo’s new engineering building. But O’Donnell’s most meaningful campaigns have been the ones he ran for his mother, an attorney general candidate, and his father, a state Supreme Court judge. “Getting to do that for your parents, after all they’ve done, was a highlight,” he says. – H.D. Diana Ostroff In what feels like a metaphor for her generation, Diana Ostroff’s lobbying career has been bookended by technological innovation. As a new business graduate of Siena College, Ostroff was hired for her first job because she knew Microsoft Windows and, wait for it, MS-DOS – the cutting-edge operating systems of the 1990s. More recently, as chief operating officer for Ostroff Associates, she has been educating legislators about AI and NFTs. “Lobbying boils down to learning your issues,” says Ostroff, who specializes in helping companies navigate policy. “That, and not burning bridges.” The daughter of Albany-area entrepreneurs, Ostroff studied business, then went on to a decade lobbying at the Business Council of New York State. As a young woman in a male-dominated field, she told an older colleague, “‘One day I’m going to represent these businesses.’ And now I do,” she says. Twelve years ago, after a string of leadership roles with regional and national business associations, Ostroff assumed a full-time role at her husband’s 28-year-old firm, whose 150-plus clients span myriad industries. She has particular expertise in energy regulation as well as multiyear economic development projects, such as the Bedford Union Armory and Staten Island’s Empire Outlets. Even as she mentors up-and-coming lobbyists, Ostroff bemoans the increasing vitriol of contemporary politics. “Our generation wasn’t like that. There was compromise,” she says. “But we as a generation need to think beyond the sound bites. And it’s my job to get clients to the end result.” – H.D. Dawn Pinnock For Dawn Pinnock, running the administrative nerve center of New York City government is more than a job – it’s a calling. Pinnock characterizes her 26 years in government as part of a mission to serve others. It led her to the nonprofit world and then into government. At the center of this objective has been a desire to focus on people-centered programs and services, whether it’s in job training, reducing juvenile recidivism or human resources. “The common theme is a call to serve because I feel it is a calling,” Pinnock says of her career. “When you are called to serve and serve people, you are not taking it for that thank you. You will serve people who you do not see or do not meet.” Pinnock sees her work as uniting Generation X. She says she and her generational peers growing up in New York City saw neighborhoods hit bottom and had an optimistic desire to serve. Pinnock says being Gen X serves her well in her current role. She says she and her friends call their generation the MacGyvers, after the 1980s television character who could figure his way out of any jam using his own wits and knowledge. “We were the only generation to know what it was like to not work with technology but are not scared to work with it,” Pinnock says. “You had to rely on yourself. We did not have the modern conveniences we have today.” – J.C. Angela Pinsky Angela Pinsky was living in New York City when the cataclysm of 9/11 prompted her – like many of her generation – “to reexamine my life,” she says. Pinsky had grown up in New Jersey assuming she would be a doctor. But after the terrorist attacks, she followed her heart into economic development, taking jobs to fortify her city. “I built my personal and my professional life around New York and figuring out ways to make it better,” Pinsky says. She met her husband, 92NY CEO Seth Pinsky, when both worked for then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And she was a key player in the administration’s strategic growth plan, which positioned New York City as a model for urban sustainability by building on its existing infrastructure. Now Pinsky directs government affairs and public policy for Google New York, championing the tech industry’s role in broadening opportunity. Under her leadership, the Silicon Valley giant invests in a range of initiatives to nurture New York City’s workforce pipeline to what Pinsky calls “good, middle-class jobs” in evolving technologies. Pinsky has held a number of advocacy jobs – most recently, leading the Association for a Better New York – but her touchstone remains the lessons she learned under Bloomberg’s legendary development chief, Dan Doctoroff. One was the transformative effects of planning on city neighborhoods like Greenpoint and Williamsburg, both rezoned as part of a failed Olympic bid. “It showed me that thinking big and having ambitious goals is a great mechanism for progress and change,” Pinsky says. – H.D. Clint Plummer As the CEO of Rise Light & Power, Clint Plummer is at the forefront of New York’s transition to renewable energy. But it was actually his childhood on an Ohio farm that first taught Plummer about strategy and investment, lessons he now applies to the redevelopment of New York City’s largest power generation facility. “You have to make informed decisions, decide where you’re going to invest your capital, then wait for growth,” Plummer says. “And while you’re waiting, you’ve got to manage your risk and your exposure.” It’s the kind of long-term thinking Plummer brings to Renewable Ravenswood, Rise’s comprehensive overhaul of a vintage fossil fuel-based generator. His clean energy vision was first ignited at MIT. While studying for a master’s degree in engineering, Plummer became convinced that America’s aging energy infrastructure would shortly and inevitably be replaced with renewable sources. A few years later, he helped launch Deepwater Wind, the company for which he spearheaded two pioneering wind farms – on Long Island’s South Fork and on Block Island. After selling the company to Ørsted U.S. Offshore Wind, he joined that company as head of new projects, championing major installations off the New York and New Jersey shores. At Rise, Plummer partners with global companies on far-reaching projects. But his inspiration lies closer to home. “I’m raising three children,” he says. “I want New York to be the best place it can be for them to grow up in – and to give them a better world than the one we found.” – H.D. Michael Preston Unlike most of his Gen X peers, Michael Preston grew up with a computer at home, as his father worked at Bell Labs. So he is ideally positioned to understand not only how profoundly technology has evolved since the 1980s, but also how kids relate to it. Preston, a pioneer of children’s computer science education, puts that knowledge to use as executive director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop. He heads the Sesame Street organization’s nonprofit research and policy lab, which provides digital innovators with “a roadmap” for children’s digital experiences, “informed and driven by kids’ voices,” Preston says. The New Jersey native didn’t set out to be a digital trailblazer. After earning a degree in East Asian studies at Harvard, he worked in educational grantmaking for the Japan Foundation and was drawn into the challenges of New York City public schools. Preston innovated with educational technology while earning a doctorate in cognitive science in education at Teachers College, Columbia University. At the New York City Department of Education, Preston oversaw the 2015 launch of CS4All, a computer science program for K-12 schools. The citywide initiative became a 10-year, $80 million public-private partnership, and Preston later co-founded a nonprofit to take the approach national. Technology evolves at a dizzying pace, but Preston’s approach is grounded in fundamentals: “Helping kids grow into the world, be empathetic toward one another, build connections,” he says. “The same principles that drive (Sesame Street) – but in this emerging tech and media space.” – H.D. Yadira Ramos-Herbert For Yadira Ramos-Herbert, it all began with a park. “I was a mom and saw a park on my block that did not look like the other parks in New Rochelle,” she says. “I started to go to community meetings and asking why the park wasn’t cleaned and have new swings.” That led to joining community committees and running for the New Rochelle City Council four years ago. Her City Council tenure was a baptism by fire: New Rochelle became the COVID-19 epicenter, and then police shot an unarmed Black man in her district. Through it all, Ramos-Herbert maintained a humble, adaptable and collaborative leadership style, which she says she’ll continue as New Rochelle’s first female and first Afro Latino mayor. As a member of Gen X, Ramos-Herbert remembers when she would reach into her pocket for a phone simply to call, text or email someone. She says this allows her to bridge the gap between senior citizens who prefer in-person conversations and youngsters who embrace TikTok or Zoom. Growing up in Hollis, Queens, Ramos-Herbert remembers running into hip-hop stars at the Jamaica Colosseum Mall – and when watching video on demand meant making a VHS recording of MTV, not searching YouTube. She remembers when Google wasn’t the way to do research. “As a nerd I remember waiting for an updated encyclopedia,” she says with a laugh. Ramos-Herbert says the experience of waiting gives Gen X a needed leadership skill. “There is something to be said for the patience we had to have,” she says. – J.C. Anne Reynolds When Anne Reynolds joined the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, the state did not have a 70% clean energy standard. School buses ran on gas, not electricity. And offshore wind farms, already a common sight overseas, were still largely a fantasy here. All that has changed in the decade since Reynolds took over leadership of ACE NY. “Europe was ahead on clean energy, but the U.S. is catching up, and New York is at the forefront,” reflects Reynolds, who was previously a deputy commissioner at the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Reynolds, who lives in the same upstate town where she grew up, got interested in environmentalism while cleaning up Boston Harbor sewage with a Tufts College class. But even as she earned a master’s degree in environmental science from Yale, she could hardly have imagined the momentum to come. In her current role, Reynolds tripled member organizations from 30 to 120 and expanded the wind and solar organization with a practice group in electric vehicles. She also spearheaded ACE’s Offshore Wind Alliance, securing five contracts for recent projects and racking up numerous policy victories, including the creation of an offshore wind program under the state’s pioneering Clean Energy Standard. On weekends, Reynolds can often be found hiking and kayaking in the Adirondacks alongside her three children. “I’m sure it annoys them,” she says, “that other people go to Niagara Falls and just get to look at the beauty. My kids get a lecture on clean power.” – H.D. Darren Rigger In the decades since he co-founded Dynamic SRG, a Westchester campaign fundraising firm, Darren Rigger has never had to advertise. Politicians simply “walk into events and say, ‘Who did this?’” says Rigger. “It’s all word of mouth.” Those luminaries include Democrats such as Gov. Kathy Hochul – a client since her first congressional run – and, for years, then-Rep. Charlie Rangel, for whom Rigger orchestrated a splashy annual fundraiser featuring the likes of Aretha Franklin and Dionne Warwick. Rigger’s first campaigns were at his Westchester grade school, where he hung up posters and “was always class president.” By his 20s, he had moved on to a new form of outreach called electronic mail – and realized that for the most part, he would rather raise the money than run for office (though he was a congressional candidate in 2005, and recently ended a decade as a council member in Peekskill). When Rigger looks back on some of his favorite fundraisers – for then-House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt and then-U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin – he’s equally nostalgic about an era before politics became “meaner, more divisive and more personal.” But his belief in the process remains as fervent as when he first caught the campaign bug, during a Democratic National Committee internship while studying at Georgetown University. “Elections have consequences,” Rigger says. “Government moves money in ways that can make or break a hospital system, build roads and bridges, revitalize entire communities. And I’ve seen so many people lose races because they just didn’t have enough money.” – H.D. Daisy RodrÃguez The child of Spanish-speaking immigrants, Daisy Rodríguez grew up just blocks from Manhattan’s American Museum of Natural History. But she never went inside until, years later, she was hired as director of government affairs – tasked with outreach to city families that, like her own, may feel intimidated by language and cultural barriers. “What I love is taking a political strategy to enforce that there should be access and welcoming into these institutions – basic rights my folks were entitled to,” Rodríguez says. The lifelong New Yorker has built a political career in the kinds of spaces she hardly even dreamed about as a child. She currently leads fundraising and lobbying for the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Bronx-based conservation organization responsible for five city zoos, including the Bronx Zoo. The job brings together Rodríguez’s lifelong interests in culture as well as science – a field she, like many students of color, felt dissuaded from pursuing in school. After earning a political science degree from Manhattan College, Rodríguez took the only job she could find in the city’s post 9/11 recession: She answered phones for U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, working her way up to community outreach director. A mentor throughout her career, Rodríguez is especially proud of a WCS workforce development initiative that engages local youth in mentored park jobs. She knows that they, like her, won’t take opportunity for granted. “Being in these spaces that hold the world’s records of life on Earth is humbling,” Rodríguez says. – H.D. Rafael Roger When Rafael Roger was growing up in the 1980s Bronx, families like his that ran small businesses had to rely on themselves – or each other. “My mom owned a bodega, my uncle owned a restaurant,” he says. “My grandparents pitched in.” But it can be hard to get ahead that way – especially for communities of color, which, Roger says, still suffer the lingering effects of discrimination. That’s why he facilitates small business financing as president of the Business Initiative Corporation of New York, a sponsor organization of the Bronx Economic Development Corp., which he recently led as interim director. Roger, who holds a master’s degree in business administration from Empire State University, worked as an insurance analyst in his 20s. But after he was laid off, Roger realized his passion lay in economic development – helping people like his family and neighbors. “It’s personal to me,” he says.Working with the federal Small Business Administration, Roger has doubled his organization’s portfolio over the past five years – and helped dozens of entrepreneurs bridge the ever-widening digital gap. “A lot of guys are working off their phones,” he says. “We have a huge economic divide in the borough.” Roger hopes his Bronx initiatives could eventually be a model statewide – or even nationally. With the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, he recently toured economically disadvantaged communities of color from Los Angeles to San Antonio. “It was eye-opening,” he says. “We’re different, but we’re all dealing with the same challenges.” – H.D. Pauline Ross Whether it’s suspicious personal protective equipment invoicing or “getting charged $5 for one screw” on a major infrastructure project, fraud and waste don’t stand a chance on Pauline Ross’ watch. As the state’s special deputy inspector general for operations, Ross has guided the state inspector general’s office through an era of expanded portfolio oversight. “We work collaboratively like ants, doing more investigations than you would think,” Ross says. Since she joined the office seven years ago, she has been “keeping things going when it feels like the world is blowing up,” whether it’s the COVID-19 remote work transition or when the governor or the state attorney general resigns. The daughter of a Jamaican immigrant, Ross had grown up protesting apartheid in South Africa and became a lawyer “to fight the system,” righting the dysfunction she saw during her 1980s Newark childhood. Ross’ leadership is all the more impressive because for most of her career, she quietly battled alcoholism. She started drinking during a “rudderless” phase after law school. She drank through jobs with then-state Sen. David Paterson, as a civil rights lawyer in the attorney general’s office and in the Gov. Andrew Cuomo administration. Valued for her consistency and steady presence, Ross reluctantly took a pause to get sober six years ago. “I learned the world was not going to fall apart,” Ross says. “That you’re actually taking a step back to take two steps forward. And that there’s always a remake.” – H.D. Stephen Sigmund After 9/11, Stephen Sigmund was unfazed by what might have seemed a daunting assignment: leading the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey’s public outreach for its $20 billion World Trade Center site redevelopment. But Sigmund – then the Port Authority’s chief of public and government affairs – came from a family with outsized ambition. His grandparents, Hale and Lindy Boggs, successively represented New Orleans in Congress for 50 years. His mother was a longtime mayor of Princeton, Sigmund’s hometown, and his aunt was the journalist Cokie Roberts. “Politics was literally in my blood,” Sigmund says (his father didn’t hold office, but taught political theory at Princeton). But typically for Gen X, “it’s not like my parents showed me anything. We had to learn by osmosis.” Sigmund found his own niche in communications, including for then-New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine and then-New York City Council Speaker Gifford Miller. “I liked the immediacy of communications,” Sigmund says. “You had a ‘report card’ in the newspaper every day.” Infrastructure has been a recent focus: Sigmund was a founding executive director of the Global Gateway Alliance, the coalition that spearheaded multibillion-dollar modernization efforts for New York City’s airports. Now he’s working on a similar project at the Gateway Development Commission – the $16 billion effort to replace New York’s aging rail tunnels. Public service may be Sigmund’s inheritance, but every day he’s more convinced of its necessity. “As a nation of 330 million people,” he says, democracy “is the thing that really connects us.” – H.D. Thomas Stanton Thomas Stanton remembers a world before Google and cell phones, but artificial intelligence doesn’t faze him. Quite the opposite: “It’s mind-blowing how fast you can do things,” says Stanton, a principal in KPMG’s forensics practice. “The use of AI to expedite investigations has been tremendous.” Stanton has been with the global accounting firm for 25 years – long enough to remember “100 people in a room, entering information into an Excel spreadsheet,” he says. Now, with a few taps of his finger, Stanton can move that data into a searchable database. And he can do it in mere seconds. What hasn’t changed is Stanton’s passion for audits and forensic accounting, which involves recovering data after disasters and keeping an eye out for fraud, waste or abuse. After studying accounting in college, the Sarasota Springs native moved to New York City. An early assignment had Stanton assisting on post-9/11 investigations, as the debris removal process turned up critical information. His most memorable assignments are a record of the past quarter-century’s disasters: Hurricane Katrina, the BP Gulf oil spill and Superstorm Sandy. More recently, Stanton has scrutinized the state’s migrant asylum-seeker program, looking for anomalies in the bills racked up with hundreds of providers of food, lodging and other services statewide. “We’re saving taxpayer dollars. It’s all of our money,” he says. “But what I really love is putting puzzles together to identify the anomalies. Every investigation is different, and you learn something new every time.” – H.D. Clovis Thorn Whether championing humane drug policy, coordinating social services or helping nonprofits prosper, Clovis Thorn has always been drawn to advocacy. Thorn was just 10 when his father died of multiple sclerosis, leaving his 33-year-old mother a widow. “The role my extended family played was so important,” he says. Thorn later fostered that sense of communal support at Grand St. Settlement, the social services outfit where he worked until this fall: “We built communities, giving people going through a hard time those opportunities to strengthen and thrive,” he says. Now Thorn aims to do that for nonprofits through Amalgamated Bank, where he coordinates financial services for many of the city’s most essential organizations. He proved his nonprofit finance bona fides at Grand St. Settlement where, as development and communications director, he led a $17 million capital campaign and helped expand services from 10,000 to 17,000 New Yorkers. Thorn had previously spent 15 years rallying support for Drug Policy Alliance, a $15 million organization dedicated to reforming drug laws locally and globally. As managing director of development, he created membership and donor programs that help kick-start the movement toward overdose prevention sites. “When I started, it was a radioactive issue,” Thorn says. “By the time I left, we’d established ourselves as policy and thought leaders.” The issues may be different, but Thorn’s guiding principles remain steadfast. “I truly believe the vast majority of people are doing the best they can,” he says. “Sometimes they might need a little help to get there.” – H.D. Darlene Williams A teacher once told Darlene Williams she would never amount to anything. “Obviously that teacher was wrong,” says Williams, who is now the head of Union Settlement, a 128-year-old East Harlem institution that is the area’s largest social services outfit. The native New Yorker joined the nonprofit organization last June, where she oversees a staff of 350 and services for 10,000 New Yorkers annually. She brings not only a social consciousness forged in the church where her father was a pastor, but also a record of championing some of New York City’s most effective nonprofits. When housing insecurity increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, Williams opened five new buildings as founding chief program officer at Win, an organization that provides emergency shelter, supportive housing and social services for homeless women and children. “I had to think off the cuff,” she says of that period. “We were essential workers. We couldn’t just work from home, while people needed homes.” For a decade, Williams has also run her own consultancy, helping local organizations with strategic planning, fundraising and diversity initiatives. She also holds doctorates in religious education and public policy and, following in her father’s footsteps, is a reverend with Evangel Temple Ministries. “Service is something that is ingrained in every aspect of what I do,” Williams says. “Particularly in areas with racial inequities, I want to help people and organizations thrive. If I’m in a position to elevate people – that’s my passion.” – H.D. Did we miss anyone? Let us know at lists@cityandstateny.com. And pitch us names for other upcoming power lists.

State authorities have launched a probe into the deadly encounter that began when the officer responded to Interstate 105 for a call about a man walking on the freeway.  Video of the confrontation, shot by a witness and posted on social media, starts with the officer on top of the man as the two wrestle on the ground.  After a few seconds, the officer attempts to get to his feet and pulls his gun as the man appears to kick at him.  The officer then fires multiple times at the man, who is motionless following the gunfire.  The officer keeps his gun drawn for about a minute before the video cuts out.  The state highway patrol said it received calls about the man walking on the freeway before responding.  “During the contact with the pedestrian, a struggle ensued and an officer involved shooting occurred,” the CHP said in its statement.  4 A California Highway Patrol officer fatally shot a man on a Los Angeles freeway Sunday in a video posted online. dwight.lewis.501/Facebook  Further questions about the incident were referred to the California Department of Justice, which confirmed it is investigating the shooting.  The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed the person died, but did not provide an identification or cause of death.  Los Angeles Councilman Tim McOsker, state Sen. Steven Bradford and state Assemblyman Mike Gipson issued a joint statement calling for a thorough investigation into the shooting and peace in the community as the inquiry is conducted.  “The video is shocking and this shooting must be fully investigated expeditiously,” McOsker said in a statement, urging transparency.  Bradford said the shooting “appears to be an unnecessary use of deadly force.”  4 State authorities have launched a probe into the deadly encounter that began when the officer responded to Interstate 105 for a call. dwight.lewis.501/Facebook  Travis Norton, a law enforcement officer who leads the California Association of Tactical Officer After Action Review, cautioned to the Los Angeles Times that footage is a limited way to get the details of a police shooting.  “It is hard to diagnose without knowing what the officer saw, experienced and interpreted was happening,” Norton told the newspaper.  “All I see is a very short scuffle. I see the suspect point something that appears to look like some sort of weapon. … From the video, without knowing anything else about it, the use of deadly force appears appropriate.”  While use-of-force expert Ed Obayashi also cautioned about jumping to conclusions from the video, he said investigators will want to know why the officer approached the man without backup nearby.  “They were able to close the freeway, so presumably there was law enforcement in the area,” said Obayashi, who investigates police shootings for law enforcement agencies in California.  4 The officer fired multiple times at the man, who was motionless following the gunfire. dwight.lewis.501/Facebook  4 A Facebook video captured the deadly event. dwight.lewis.501/Facebook  He also stressed that the probe will focus on whether the man was armed and why the officer fired his gun after he stood up and away from the struggle.  “Was there a knife?

California Highway Patrol officer fatally shoots man on freeway,2023-11-20,2023-11-28T00:22:17Z,en,staradvertiser.com,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/11/20/breaking-news/california-highway-patrol-officer-fatally-shoots-man-on-freeway/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231128002217id_/https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/11/20/breaking-news/california-highway-patrol-officer-fatally-shoots-man-on-freeway/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231128002217/https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/11/20/breaking-news/california-highway-patrol-officer-fatally-shoots-man-on-freeway/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyKS8yMDIzLzExLzIwL2JyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1oaWdod2F5LXBhdHJvbC1vZmZpY2VyLWZhdGFsbHktc2hvb3RzLW1hbi1vbi1mcmVld2F5,"LOS ANGELES >> State authorities were investigating Monday after a California Highway Patrol officer shot and killed a man over the weekend in the middle of a Los Angeles area freeway during a struggle recorded on video. Sunday afternoon’s deadly encounter occurred after the highway patrol responded to multiple calls of a male pedestrian walking in westbound lanes of Interstate 105 in south LA County, the agency said in a statement. All traffic in that direction was temporarily blocked. “During the contact with the pedestrian, a struggle ensued and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” the statement said. The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office confirmed the person died but did not provide identification, pending notification of family. A cause of death was not immediately released. The highway patrol referred inquiries about the investigation to the California Department of Justice, which typically investigates fatal police shootings. The justice department confirmed it was investigating, but provided no additional details. A minute-long video recorded by a bystander and posted on social media begins with an officer on top of another person as the two grapple in the middle of a closed stretch of freeway. It was not clear who took the original video. As they struggle, a shot is fired and the officer suddenly jumps to his feet while the other man goes limp on the pavement. The officer immediately fires at least four shots at the prone man, the video shows. For the remainder of the clip, the officer keeps his gun drawn while the man lies motionless. Ed Obayashi, a use-of-force expert who investigates police shootings for law enforcement agencies in California, cautioned against jumping to conclusions from the video alone. Obayashi said investigators will want to know why the officer approached the pedestrian without a partner or other backup nearby. “They were able to close the freeway, so presumably there was law enforcement in the area,” he said. Obayashi said the investigation will focus on whether the man was armed and why the officer felt the need to shoot after standing up and disengaging from the fight. “Was there a knife? Or a stun gun?” Obayashi said investigators will ask. “We don’t know what kind of threat this officer perceived.” Highway patrol officers aren’t required to wear body cameras, but the agency uses in-car cameras. State Sen. Steven Bradford, Assemblymember Mike A.

Sunday afternoon’s deadly encounter occurred after the highway patrol responded to multiple calls of a male pedestrian walking in westbound lanes of Interstate 105 in south LA County, the agency said in a statement. All traffic in that direction was temporarily blocked. A CHP officer tried to convince the man to get off the freeway but he refused and that led to a struggle, authorities said. âDuring the struggle, the pedestrian was able to access a Taser he had in his possession, activated the weapon, and used the Taser against the officer,â the CHP said in a later statement. âFollowing the pedestrianâs use of the weapon against the officer, and in fear for his safety, the officer fired his service weapon.” The man was pronounced dead at a hospital. The Los Angeles County medical examinerâs office confirmed the person died but did not provide identification, pending notification of family. A cause of death was not immediately released. The highway patrol referred inquiries about the investigation to the California Department of Justice, which typically investigates fatal police shootings. The justice department confirmed it was investigating, but provided no additional details. A minute-long video recorded by a bystander and posted on social media begins with an officer on top of another person as the two grapple in the middle of a closed stretch of freeway. It was not clear who took the original video. As they struggle, a shot is fired and the officer suddenly jumps to his feet while the other man goes limp on the pavement. The officer immediately fires at least four shots at the prone man, the video shows. For the remainder of the clip, the officer keeps his gun drawn while the man lies motionless. Ed Obayashi, a use-of-force expert who investigates police shootings for law enforcement agencies in California, cautioned against jumping to conclusions from the video alone. Obayashi said investigators will want to know why the officer approached the pedestrian without a partner or other backup nearby. âThey were able to close the freeway, so presumably there was law enforcement in the area,â he said. Obayashi said the investigation will focus on whether the man was armed and why the officer felt the need to shoot after standing up and disengaging from the fight. âWas there a knife? Or a stun gun?â Obayashi said investigators will ask. âWe donât know what kind of threat this officer perceived.â Highway patrol officers aren’t required to wear body cameras, but the agency uses in-car cameras. State Sen. Steven Bradford, Assemblymember Mike A. Gipson and Councilmember Tim McOsker, who represent the area where the shooting occurred, released a joint statement calling for transparency by the highway patrol. âThe video of this shooting is deeply disturbing,â Bradford said. âThis appears to be an unnecessary use of deadly force.

Video recorded by a bystander appears to show a deadly encounter in which a California Highway Patrol officer repeatedly shoots a man after a struggle in the middle of the 105 Freeway in Watts on Sunday afternoon.  CHP officials said Monday evening that they responded to the freeway about 3:15 p.m. Sunday after receiving multiple calls about a man walking through traffic near the Wilmington Avenue exit.  After the trooper made contact with the pedestrian, “a struggle ensued and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” the CHP said in a release. CHP officials said that during the altercation the man “was able to access a Taser” and used it against him.  For the record: An earlier version of this article said the man fatally shot by a CHP officer took a Taser from the officer. CHP officials say the man “was able to access a Taser he had in his possession” and used it against the officer.  “In fear for his safety, the officer fired his service weapon, striking the pedestrian,” the CHP statement said.  Advertisement  The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office did not provide identification of the deceased Monday, pending notification of family. A cause of death was not released.  The video shows a CHP officer on top of another person as the two struggle on the pavement in the middle of what appears to be a closed stretch of freeway.  After a few seconds, while the two tussle, a gun seems to go off and a bullet ricochets off the pavement near the body of the man, who remains on the ground.  The officer then stands up and shoots at least four additional times at the prone man.  The man lies motionless for the rest of the minute-long video. The CHP officer remains by the body with his gun drawn.  It was not immediately clear who posted the video online.  State Sen. Steven Bradford (D-Gardena) called the video “deeply disturbing” and said the community deserves answers.  “If the roles were reversed, people would be immediately calling for murder charges,” Bradford said. “I call on the California Highway Patrol and the Department of Justice to be transparent and for the community to be calm and patient during the investigation.”  The CHP directed all inquiries to the California Department of Justice, which investigates police shootings in which unarmed people are killed, according to the department.  Advertisement  The state Department of Justice declined comment but confirmed in a statement the agency is investigating the shooting.  The shots were audible from the Salvation Army shelter below the freeway’s banks, where a faint trace of blood remained visible Monday morning.  People at the homeless shelter said they didn’t know the victim, but said it’s common to see others walking on the freeway, searching for bottles and cans.  Residents at nearby Imperial Courts, who were awaiting the start of a turkey giveaway, said they also heard the shots fired Sunday.  Terikisha Burke, 35, said she missed a flight to Atlanta because she got stuck in traffic on the 105 after the shooting. She sat at the on-ramp with her 5-year-old for “three hours and some change,” costing her thousands of dollars and a holiday catering job, she said.  “I never knew it was a shooting until you told me,” she told The Times.  Travis Norton, a law enforcement officer who runs the California Assn. of Tactical Officers After Action Review, said video is a limited way to understand a police shooting.  “It is hard to diagnose without knowing what the officer saw, experienced and interpreted was happening,” Norton said. “All I see is a very short scuffle. I see the suspect point something that appears to look like some sort of weapon. ... From the video, without knowing anything else about it, the use of deadly force appears appropriate.”  But other experts said the use of force raises many questions.  Ed Obayashi, a police shootings expert who investigates the incidents for numerous law enforcement agencies in California, said investigators will immediately ask the officer why he was engaging with the person without a partner or backup in the immediate vicinity.  Obayashi also said that investigators will look into why the officer felt the need to shoot the man after standing up and disengaging from him.  “Why did you shoot him while he was on the ground?” Obayashi said investigators will ask. “You separated yourself from the individual; why was he still a threat to you?”  Staff writer Jeremy Childs contributed to this report."

The attack at the Walmart in Beavercreek, a suburb of Dayton, just days before Thanksgiving injured four shoppers: three women and a man. Police said three were in stable condition and one of the women in critical but stable condition on Tuesday afternoon at area hospitals. Authorities declined to release the identities of the victims, including their races, saying they had not ruled out that the attack was racially motivated. âTragedy struck our beloved community Monday evening, and, in the face of adversity, the strength of our community shines through,â Beavercreek Mayor Bob Stone said during a Tuesday news conference. Walmart said it was working closely with investigators to try to determine why the shooter, identified as 20-year-old Benjamin Charles Jones, of Dayton, opened fire. Police said Jones entered the store at about 8:30 p.m. Monday wielding a Hi-Point 45-caliber Carbine long gun. He shot an undetermined number of rounds, leaving injured victims throughout the building, before turning the weapon on himself, authorities said. Efforts made by The Associated Press to reach relatives of Jones were unsuccessful. âWeâre heartbroken by whatâs happened at our Beavercreek, Ohio store. This remains a developing situation, and weâre working closely with investigators on the scene,â Walmart said in a statement. Christopher Suffron told WHIO-TV in Dayton that he was shopping with his wife when they heard five or six shots ring out. âI turned around and told her to get behind me,â he said. Suffron said he then saw the shooter about 10 feet away and the couple ran out of the store through nearby receiving doors. As they escaped, he said he heard another five or six shots. The shooting happened almost exactly one day after a man shot and killed a woman before fatally shooting himself outside a Walmart in Anchorage, Alaska. Police in Anchorage said Tuesday it was a domestic-violence related crime. They said in a statement no one else was involved. Both shootings came nearly a year after a Walmart supervisor in Chesapeake, Virginia, fatally shot six employees two days before Thanksgiving. Walmart, which has police outposts in some of its 4,600 locations nationwide, has taken steps over the years to address gun violence. The retailer based in Bentonville, Arkansas, launched a computer-based active shooter training in 2015 that focused on three pillars: avoid the danger, keep your distance and lastly, defend. Then in 2019, after a white gunman killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in a racist attack that targeted Hispanic shoppers, Walmart discontinued sales of certain kinds of ammunition. It also asked that customers no longer openly carry firearms in its stores. The retailer now sells only hunting rifles and related ammunition. âWe take a comprehensive approach to promoting a safe shopping and work environmentâincluding policies, training, monitoring, and responseâas well as regular reviews of security protocols and practices,â Joe Pennington, a company spokesperson, said in a statement. âWhile we donât publicly discuss security measures we take in our stores, the safety of our associates and customers is a top priority.â The store in Ohio where Mondayâs shooting took place was the scene of a fatal shooting involving police almost 10 years ago. A white police officer shot 22-year-old John Crawford III after he picked up an unpackaged pellet rifle he found on a shelf in August 2014. The family of the Black man reached a settlement of $1.7 million with the city of Beavercreek. The settlement included changes in police policy. Beavercreek Mayor Stone said Monday’s shooting brought the earlier case to mind. âIt can’t help but bring back memories,â he said. âYou know, it’s a tragedy all in itself, though, and this is the tragedy we are grieving for, and it’s a shame in this way that it has to be compared to the previous shooting.â ___ Smyth reported from Columbus and Seewer from Toledo.

Decatur Police Chief Todd Pinion wrote in a statement Friday that the department has completed an internal investigation into the Sept. 29 shooting of Steve Perkins. The fatal shooting of the Black man in front of his own home has drawn regular protests in the north Alabama city. Perkins, 39, was killed by a police officer as officers accompanied a tow truck driver trying to repossess Perkinsâ truck. The Decatur Police Department said in an initial public statement that officers were called to the scene by the tow truck driver, who said the homeowner pulled a gun. Police said that the man, identified as Perkins, later threatened the driver and âturned the gun toward one of the officers.â Perkinsâ family has disputed the police version of events. âI found reason to believe that policies were violated and the final report and findings were sent to the Legal Department and outside counsel late this afternoon to prepare the formal documents to move forward the discipline process,â Pinion wrote in a statement. Pinion said the cityâs mayor will conduct a review and âmake a final determination if discipline is warranted and to what extent.â He said the officer who fired the shots remains on administrative leave. The department has not released the name or race of the officer. Video from a neighborâs home surveillance camera video, published by WAFF, captured the shooting. The video shows the tow truck back into the driveway. An officer is heard shouting, âPolice, get on the ground,â and shots are immediately fired in rapid succession. Police have not released body-camera footage of the shooting. An attorney representing the Perkins family, told The Associated Press last month that Perkins did not appear aware that officers were there before they immediately opened fire on him. Perkinsâ family issued a statement saying the truck payments were up to date so the truck shouldnât have been towed. Perkinsâ brother, Nick Perkins, told WAFF that there is a âslight sense of reliefâ to hear the police chief acknowledge that policies were broken, but that the investigation has taken too long. âWeâve seen the cameras. Weâve seen the video footage,â Nick Perkins said. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is investigating the shooting. âThis has been a very painful chapter for Decatur and I recognize healing will not occur for many until after all information that can be released has been made public and all determinations on violation of policy and state law completed and potential litigation resolved,â Pinion wrote.

Fairburn, 61, was also charged with possession of drugs (methamphetamine), possession of drug paraphernalia, simultaneous possession of drugs and weapon, and habitual offender violations. He was released from UAMS Medical Center in Little Rock, where he had been receiving medical care, to the custody of the Sebastian County sheriff's office, according to a news release from the state police.  Fort Smith police officers on Oct. 25 attempted to serve a felony warrant on Fairburn, an Indiana fugitive and violent sex offender. Fairburn brandished a knife as officers tried to take him into custody, and officers shot him, the release said.  Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue, in a Nov. 8 letter, said his office reviewed the incident and found Fort Smith police officers Tucker Romesburg and Caleb Jenkins were justified under state law in shooting Fairburn.  Shue said the incident began in a wooded area across from Shamrock Liquor on Midland Boulevard when Romesburg, Jenkins and another officer, Arthur Lewis, were trying to serve Fairburn a felony warrant out of Indiana. Fairburn threatened to kill the officers, brandished a knife and aggressively moved toward them, authorities said. Romesburg told Fairburn to drop the knife and get on the ground, but Fairburn fled across Midland Boulevard toward the liquor store.  Lewis unsuccessfully tried to use a stun gun on Fairburn, who proceeded to throw a knife that hit Lewis in his inner right thigh, according to Shue. Fairburn was holding a second knife in his other hand when Romesburg and Jenkins shot him, authorities said.  Shue said the officers then called for emergency medical services. Romesburg applied tourniquets to both of Fairburn's legs to control his bleeding. Fairburn was taken to an area hospital before being taken to UAMS.  Lewis said during an interview with state police he encountered Fairburn the night before the incident, according to Shue. Fairburn ended up fleeing from Lewis, who seized a BB air rifle from the area of the encounter, along with several knives that were reportedly stuck in a piece of wood. Lewis said it appeared Fairburn had been throwing the knives at the wood.  An investigation by the state police was ongoing. In accordance with Fort Smith police protocols, officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a separate internal investigation."

The demonstration was peaceful, although minor rioting broke out at a university campus in another part of the capital after a few dozen youths set fire to dumpsters and threw Molotov cocktails at police who appeared on the scene. Violence also broke out after the end of a similar march in Greece's second city of Thessaloniki, when youths threw Molotov cocktails and stones at police who responded with tear gas. Police said nine suspected rioters were detained. There were also minor clashes in the southern city of Patras. The annual march in Athens started from the Polytechnic campus, which was the headquarters of the uprising, and headed toward the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. is still widely blamed in Greece for supporting the 1967-74 right-wing dictatorship during the Cold War. Many of the protesters Friday carried Palestinian flags, and several continued on from the U.S. Embassy to the Israeli embassy chanting slogans against the war in Gaza. The march is often marred by rioting by far-left supporters, and thousands of police were on duty Friday to maintain the peace. Tensions have been simmering in recent days, after the fatal police shooting of a Roma teenager following a high-speed car chase in central Greece. The march was preceded by a group of students carrying a blood-spattered Greek flag that flew at the Polytechnic during the events of 1973. The Polytechnic uprising, which came a year before the collapse of the dictatorship, was crushed by the Greek military and security forces who used a tank to smash through the campus gates. Dozens of people were killed by government forces before and during the violent crackdown, though the precise number of victims is still a matter of dispute. German trains collide; 7 people injured BERLIN -- A high-speed train and a regional train were involved in an accident in southern Germany on Friday that left several people slightly injured, police said. Police wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that there was ""lateral contact"" between the high-speed ICE train and the regional service at Reichertshausen, between Ingolstadt and Munich. They said that seven people were slightly injured and the trains were being evacuated. University blast leaves 1 dead in Armenia YEREVAN, Armenia -- An explosion rocked a university building in Armenia's capital, Yerevan, on Friday, killing one person and injuring three others, authorities said. The Interior Ministry said the blast happened in the basement of the chemistry department building at Yerevan State University. One person died and three others were hospitalized with burns and other injuries, health officials said, adding that one was in critical condition. Authorities were investigating the cause of the blast. Undersea earthquake rattles Filipinos MANILA, Philippines -- A powerful undersea earthquake shook the southern Philippines on Friday, causing ceilings in shopping malls to plunge to the ground as shoppers screamed. No tsunami warning was in effect. The Office of Civil Defense said it was investigating a report of one death. The magnitude 6.7 quake was located 16 miles from Burias at the southern tip of the Philippines, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was centered at a depth of 48 miles, it said. Videos posted on social media showed ceilings falling at two large malls as pillars swayed and people cowered and shouted in fear. The SM City General Santos mall and Robinsons GenSan mall announced temporary closures. There were no reports of injuries there. Photos also showed a collapsed roof at a school. The presidential palace said President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. instructed government agencies to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone the quake affected. The Philippines experiences regular earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because of its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of seismic faults around the ocean."

A 47-year-old woman also died of gunshot wounds, though it was not immediately clear who fired the shots that killed her. Pierce County and Kitsap County deputies, along with FBI agents, tried to arrest the man around 3 a.m., according to the latter county’s Sheriff’s Office. The agencies did not provide information about the homicide the man was suspected of. The man fired shots at deputies at 3:40 a.m. while barricading himself in a home in the 3000 block of Forest Drive Northeast, the agency said. The man continued to barricade himself and fire shots throughout the morning, according to Kitsap Sheriff’s officials. Deputies didn’t return fire until late morning, according to Kitsap Sheriff’s spokesperson Kevin McCarty. Additional law enforcement, including a Kitsap Sheriff’s SWAT team and a State Patrol SWAT team, responded, according to the Kitsap Critical Incident Response Team. Just after 10 a.m., shots were reported from the north side of the home. Shortly before 11 a.m., the Sheriff’s Office confirmed law enforcement shot the man, who died at the scene. Neither the sequence that led to the shooting nor the specific circumstances of the deadly incident were immediately clear. The Sheriff’s Office didn’t say how many law enforcement officers were involved or which agency they’re from. No law enforcement officers were hurt. Responders took the wounded woman to St. Michael’s Medical Center in Silverdale, according to the Sheriff’s Office. She died at the hospital. The Kitsap Critical Incident Response Team and the Pierce County Force Investigation Team are investigating. Investigators remained at the scene Friday night processing evidence."

The officers fired three dozen shots, officials said during a press conference Friday afternoon at Baltimore police headquarters where they played the recordings and presented the department’s view of them.  The shooting occurred Nov. 7, when officers on a District Action Team — a squad focused on seizing illegal guns — were proactively patrolling in southwest Baltimore. A man later identified as Hunter Jessup, 27, was killed during a short foot pursuit. The videos show him appear to fire his own weapon before he’s struck by gunfire and falls to the sidewalk.  Officials said they haven’t determined how many times Jessup was shot.  In the aftermath of the shooting, some community members questioned whether his death was necessary. They said officers on the department’s specialized gun squads have a reputation for displaying overly aggressive behavior and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters, especially in that neighborhood.

But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley has commended the officers’ actions, saying they protected public safety in an area plagued by violence. He also said they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire.  “While it’s an unfortunate incident, the investigation is still going on,” he said, adding that officers will continue patrolling the area “to provide greater visibility and better response times with the goal of deterring and preventing violent crime.”  Police work at the scene of a shooting Tuesday afternoon, Nov. 7, 2023, in southwest Baltimore. Officers shot and killed a man after he allegedly pointed a gun at them. Credit: AP/Jerry Jackson  Worley said police are trained to “shoot to incapacitate” whenever they encounter someone they consider “a threat of deadly violence,” which often means continuing to shoot until the threat has passed. In this case, the officers fired 36 shots at Jessup, Worley said.  The entire interaction lasted less than a minute.  The videos show police in two vehicles talking with two men standing on a corner. The men lift their shirts in response to a request from the officers, who saw a “bulge” in Jessup’s clothing, officials said. Off-camera, he takes off running. Officers pursue him on foot and by car, converging on a sidewalk around the corner.  One officer jumps out of a vehicle and tries to tackle Jessup, despite the gun in his right hand, but he slips away. Others point their weapons at him, repeatedly yelling at him to “get on the ground” and “drop the gun.” Jessup keeps running and turns toward another officer as all four open fire.  During Friday’s news conference, officials pointed to a slowed-down version of the video that appears to show a bullet from Jessup’s gun striking a parked car. Officials said they’re still processing evidence to determine how many shots Jessup fired.  Worley said Jessup’s family members viewed the recordings from the four officers’ body cameras before it was made public.  A woman who answered the phone at a number listed for Jessup’s possible relative said she had no comment before hanging up.  Police said Jessup was under correctional supervision in a case from a different jurisdiction. They didn’t provide additional details about the case.  The Maryland Attorney General’s Office is investigating. Under a state law change that went into effect Oct. 1, the statewide office will decide whether to bring criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Previously, that decision fell to local prosecutors.  Baltimore’s DAT squads have been scrutinized, particularly after another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances this year, leaving a teen in critical condition less than a mile from where Jessup was shot. Police tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was armed, and an officer shot him from behind as he ran away holding a gun in one hand.  Department leaders created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded amid federal racketeering charges accusing several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the city’s Black community."

The families of five Minnesota men who were killed by law enforcement officers have announced a lawsuit to force the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to release its investigative files on their deaths, saying the state agency has failed to comply with Minnesota’s open records law. (Shari L. Gross/Star Tribune via AP) Shari L. Gross/AP  MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The families of five Minnesota men who were killed by police officers announced a lawsuit Thursday to force the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to release its investigative files on their deaths, saying the state agency has failed to comply with Minnesota's open records law.  The lawsuit, filed Monday in Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul, says once the investigation into a deadly force incident is completed and a prosecutor decides not to charge the officers, the data legally should be turned over to the families of the deceased within 10 days of them requesting it.  Prosecutors in all five cases cleared the officers of wrongdoing. But the lawsuit says the BCA still hasn't met its legal obligations to the families.

The officers fired three dozen shots, officials said during a press conference Friday afternoon at Baltimore police headquarters where they played the recordings and presented the departmentâs view of them. The shooting occurred Nov. 7, when officers on a District Action Team â a squad focused on seizing illegal guns â were proactively patrolling in southwest Baltimore. A man later identified as Hunter Jessup, 27, was killed during a short foot pursuit. The videos show him appear to fire his own weapon before heâs struck by gunfire and falls to the sidewalk. Officials said they havenât determined how many times Jessup was shot. In the aftermath of the shooting, some community members questioned whether his death was necessary. They said officers on the departmentâs specialized gun squads have a reputation for displaying overly aggressive behavior and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters, especially in that neighborhood. But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley has commended the officersâ actions, saying they protected public safety in an area plagued by violence. He also said they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire. âWhile itâs an unfortunate incident, the investigation is still going on,â he said, adding that officers will continue patrolling the area âto provide greater visibility and better response times with the goal of deterring and preventing violent crime.â Worley said police are trained to âshoot to incapacitateâ whenever they encounter someone they consider âa threat of deadly violence,â which often means continuing to shoot until the threat has passed. In this case, the officers fired 36 shots at Jessup, Worley said. The entire interaction lasted less than a minute. The videos show police in two vehicles talking with two men standing on a corner. The men lift their shirts in response to a request from the officers, who saw a âbulgeâ in Jessupâs clothing, officials said. Off-camera, he takes off running. Officers pursue him on foot and by car, converging on a sidewalk around the corner. One officer jumps out of a vehicle and tries to tackle Jessup, despite the gun in his right hand, but he slips away. Others point their weapons at him, repeatedly yelling at him to âget on the groundâ and âdrop the gun.â Jessup keeps running and turns toward another officer as all four open fire. During Fridayâs news conference, officials pointed to a slowed-down version of the video that appears to show a bullet from Jessupâs gun striking a parked car. Officials said theyâre still processing evidence to determine how many shots Jessup fired. Worley said Jessupâs family members viewed the recordings from the four officersâ body cameras before it was made public. A woman who answered the phone at a number listed for Jessupâs possible relative said she had no comment before hanging up. Police said Jessup was under correctional supervision in a case from a different jurisdiction. They didnât provide additional details about the case. The Maryland Attorney Generalâs Office is investigating. Under a state law change that went into effect Oct. 1, the statewide office will decide whether to bring criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Previously, that decision fell to local prosecutors. Baltimoreâs DAT squads have been scrutinized, particularly after another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances this year, leaving a teen in critical condition less than a mile from where Jessup was shot. Police tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was armed, and an officer shot him from behind as he ran away holding a gun in one hand. Department leaders created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded amid federal racketeering charges accusing several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the cityâs Black community."

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul, says once the investigation into a deadly force incident is completed and a prosecutor decides not to charge the officers, the data legally should be turned over to the families of the deceased within 10 days of them requesting it. Prosecutors in all five cases cleared the officers of wrongdoing. But the lawsuit says the BCA still hasn’t met its legal obligations to the families. An agency spokesperson said the BCA releases information to families as quickly as it can.

The march is often marred by rioting by far-left supporters and thousands of police were on duty Friday to maintain the peace.  Tensions have been simmering in recent days, after the fatal police shooting of a Roma teenager following a high-speed car chase in central Greece.  Police were stationed outside the embassy building, located just off a major Athens thoroughfare, to prevent protesters from getting close.  The Polytechnic uprising, which came a year before the collapse of the dictatorship, was crushed by the Greek military and security forces who used a tank to smash through the campus gates.  Dozens of people were killed by government forces before and during the violent crackdown, though the precise number of victims is still a matter of dispute."

6 additional Colorado officers charged in fatal police shooting of Christian Glass,2023-11-17,2023-11-18T09:02:17Z,en,denverpost.com,https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/17/christian-glass-police-shooting-officers-charged/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118090217id_/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/17/christian-glass-police-shooting-officers-charged/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118090217/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/17/christian-glass-police-shooting-officers-charged/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGRlbnZlcnBvc3QpLzIwMjMvMTEvMTcvY2hyaXN0aWFuLWdsYXNzLXBvbGljZS1zaG9vdGluZy1vZmZpY2Vycy1jaGFyZ2Vk,"Six additional law enforcement officers were criminally charged this week in connection with the police shooting of Christian Glass, the 22-year-old Boulder man who was killed by a Clear Creek County sheriff’s deputy after he called 911 for help in 2022. Georgetown Marshal Randy Williams, 63, Georgetown police Officer Timothy Collins, 31, Idaho Springs police Officer Brittany Morrow, 35, Colorado State Trooper Ryan Bennie, 43, and Division of Gaming officers Christa Lloyd, 31, and Mary J. Harris, 69, were all charged Thursday with failing to intervene in the excessive force of another officer. Williams is also charged with third-degree assault; charging documents say he caused “bodily injury” to Glass during the incident. The six law enforcement officers are scheduled to make their first appearances in court on Dec. 12 on the new charges, which are all Class 1 misdemeanors. Fifth Judicial District Attorney Heidi McCollum filed the new criminal charges the same day a former sergeant involved in the case, Kyle Gould, pleaded guilty to failing to intervene in the excessive force of another officer. He was sentenced to probation. “Law enforcement officers must be held accountable for their actions when performing their trusted public service duties,” McCollum said in a statement issued Friday morning. Gould and Andrew Buen, the Clear Creek County sheriff’s deputy who shot Glass, were until Friday the only two officers who faced criminal charges stemming from the June 2022 incident. Buen has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and official misconduct. Both were fired after the incident, and Gould agreed to never again work as a law enforcement officer when he pleaded guilty Thursday. When asked about the timing of the new charges and the year-long gap since charges were brought against Buen and Gould, McCollum noted that Buen and Gould were indicted by a grand jury. “As a result of the grand jury, there were only two individuals who did receive indictments and the two individuals who were charged with the most serious crimes,” she said in an interview. “…The severity of those charges really needed to be handled first. And since those cases have developed, it was determined that it was appropriate that every other officer on scene be charged.” Glass was experiencing a mental health crisis when he called 911 on the night of June 10, 2022, and asked for help because he’d crashed his car down an embankment in Clear Creek County. He told the dispatcher that he was afraid of “skinwalkers” and people chasing him. Seven law enforcement officers responded and spent more than an hour trying to coax Glass out of the car while he was experiencing delusions and paranoia. Eventually, Buen called Gould, who was his supervisor, and Gould gave permission for the officers to break Glass’ window and pull him from the car, even though Glass was not suspected of a crime. In the chaos that ensued, Glass grabbed a knife and officers fired a Taser at him and shot him with beanbags in an attempt to force him to drop it. Instead, Glass twisted in the driver’s seat and thrust the knife toward an officer standing next to the shattered window behind him, prompting the deputy to shoot him. A grand jury later found Glass committed no crime and acted in self-defense before he was killed. The involved agencies agreed to a $19 million settlement with Glass’ parents in May. “Those six officers didn’t pull the trigger, but they absolutely had a responsibility to stop that rouge cop,” Sally Glass, Christian’s mother, said during a news conference Friday. “…Six of them stood by and let him be murdered.” Col. Matthew Packard, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said in a statement Friday that Glass’ death was a tragedy and that “those responsible for his death should be held accountable.” But he said that group doesn’t include Bennie. “I found no indication that Trooper Bennie violated any Colorado State Patrol policy or training.” Packard said in the statement. “I am shocked by the decision of the district attorney to pursue charges against Trooper Bennie.” When reached by phone Friday, Collins declined to comment and referred questions to his attorney Reid Elkus, who did not immediately return a request for comment. Elkus previously represented former Aurora police Officer Randy Roedema, who was last month convicted of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault in the death of Elijah McClain.

The demonstration was peaceful, although minor rioting broke out at a university campus in another part of the capital after a few dozen youths set fires to dumpsters and threw petrol bombs at police who appeared on the scene. Violence also broke out after the end of a similar march in Greece's second city of Thessaloniki, when youths threw petrol bombs and stones at police who responded with tear gas. Police said nine suspected rioters were detained. There were also minor clashes in the southern city of Patras. The annual march in Athens started from the Polytechnic campus, which was the headquarters of the uprising, and headed toward the U.S. Embassy. America is still widely blamed in Greece for supporting the 1967-74 rightwing dictatorship during the Cold War. Many of the protesters Friday carried Palestinian flags, and several continued on from the U.S. Embassy to the Israeli embassy chanting slogans against the war in Gaza. The march was preceded by a group of students carrying a blood-spattered Greek flag that flew at the Polytechnic during the events of 1973. The march is often marred by rioting by far-left supporters and thousands of police were on duty Friday to maintain the peace. Tensions have been simmering in recent days, after the fatal police shooting of a Roma teenager following a high-speed car chase in central Greece. Police were stationed outside the embassy building, located just off a major Athens thoroughfare, to prevent protesters from getting close.

Deputies responding to the resident's complaint made contact with Jeremy Adams, 39, at a Wasson Lane residence in Shannon Hills, the release states.  Adams did not obey orders from deputies and was combative, the release states, leading to a fight in which one of the deputies tried to use a Taser on Adams.  It was unclear from the release if the Taser had any effect on Adams, but a deputy shot Adams more than once with his service pistol, the report states. The release did not state how many deputies were involved, or if the deputy that attempted to use a Taser on Adams was the same deputy that shot him.  Adams died of his wounds at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Medical Center in Little Rock a 7:15 p.m., the release states.  The Saline County sheriff’s office asked Arkansas State Police investigators to review the incident, which is common practice with police shootings. State police investigators will turn over their completed investigative file to a prosecutor who will determine if the deputies’ actions were legal."

The officers fired three dozen shots, officials said during a press conference Friday afternoon at Baltimore police headquarters where they played the recordings and presented the departmentâs view of them. The shooting occurred Nov. 7, when officers on a District Action Team â a squad focused on seizing illegal guns â were proactively patrolling in southwest Baltimore. A man later identified as Hunter Jessup, 27, was killed during a short foot pursuit. The videos show him appear to fire his own weapon before heâs struck by gunfire and falls to the sidewalk. Officials said they havenât determined how many times Jessup was shot. In the aftermath of the shooting, some community members questioned whether his death was necessary. They said officers on the departmentâs specialized gun squads have a reputation for displaying overly aggressive behavior and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters, especially in that neighborhood. But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley has commended the officersâ actions, saying they protected public safety in an area plagued by violence. He also said they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire. âWhile itâs an unfortunate incident, the investigation is still going on,â he said, adding that officers will continue patrolling the area âto provide greater visibility and better response times with the goal of deterring and preventing violent crime.â Worley said police are trained to âshoot to incapacitateâ whenever they encounter someone they consider âa threat of deadly violence,â which often means continuing to shoot until the threat has passed. In this case, the officers fired 36 shots at Jessup, Worley said. The entire interaction lasted less than a minute. The videos show police in two vehicles talking with two men standing on a corner. The men lift their shirts in response to a request from the officers, who saw a âbulgeâ in Jessupâs clothing, officials said. Off-camera, he takes off running. Officers pursue him on foot and by car, converging on a sidewalk around the corner. One officer jumps out of a vehicle and tries to tackle Jessup, despite the gun in his right hand, but he slips away. Others point their weapons at him, repeatedly yelling at him to âget on the groundâ and âdrop the gun.â Jessup keeps running and turns toward another officer as all four open fire. During Fridayâs news conference, officials pointed to a slowed-down version of the video that appears to show a bullet from Jessupâs gun striking a parked car. Officials said theyâre still processing evidence to determine how many shots Jessup fired. Worley said Jessupâs family members viewed the recordings from the four officersâ body cameras before it was made public. A woman who answered the phone at a number listed for Jessupâs possible relative said she had no comment before hanging up. Police said Jessup was under correctional supervision in a case from a different jurisdiction. They didnât provide additional details about the case. The Maryland Attorney Generalâs Office is investigating. Under a state law change that went into effect Oct. 1, the statewide office will decide whether to bring criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Previously, that decision fell to local prosecutors. Baltimoreâs DAT squads have been scrutinized, particularly after another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances this year, leaving a teen in critical condition less than a mile from where Jessup was shot. Police tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was armed, and an officer shot him from behind as he ran away holding a gun in one hand. Department leaders created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded amid federal racketeering charges accusing several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the cityâs Black community.

The police fatally shot Hunter Jessup, 27, on Nov. 7 in the Millhill neighborhood. The Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, which reviews all fatal police shootings, last week identified the officers who fired their weapons as William Healy, Brittany Routh, Justin Oliva and Brandon Columbo. Video from the four officers shows them pursuing Jessup, who was wearing a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, as he ran on the sidewalk. He turned around and aimed what police called a handgun with an extended magazine as officers repeatedly yelled for him to drop his weapon. Deputy Commissioner Brian Nadeau said Jessup shot at officers, creating a bullet hole on a parked car that appears in the footage. The Independent Investigations Division said in a news release last week that ballistics evidence “was consistent” with him firing his gun. Officers fired about 36 rounds at Jessup, Nadeau said, but it’s unclear how many hit him. Asked when police are trained to fire, Police Commissioner Richard Worley said it would be the moment Jessup turned. “I can’t speak for the officers but being an officer, as soon as he turns to me with his weapon and he points that weapon at me, that means he’s going to try to kill me or shoot me and I would shoot right back at him,” Worley said. He said officers in such scenarios are taught to “shoot to incapacitate.” The encounter began when two teams from the Southwest District Action Team, each composed of three officers, spotted two people on the sidewalk near Brunswick and St. Benedict streets at about 12:30 p.m., Nadeau said. Officers in one car asked the men to lift up their shirts to show if they were armed. “It’s an area where we’ve had a lot of violence in the past,” Worley said of the neighborhood. Footage from an officer sitting in the backseat shows one man lifting his hoodie to show his waistband. Nadeau said when Jessup lifted his shirt, police saw “a bulge,” a moment not captured on video. When officers got out of the car, Jessup ran, Nadeau said. Some officers pursued Jessup on foot as he ran onto the 2600 block of Wilkens Avenue, while a car with its sirens on turned and followed him onto Wilkens Avenue, the videos show. Footage from Routh shows her getting out of the car and running toward Jessup from the front as he holds a gun in one hand. She tried to grab him, but missed, and he ran past her. As Routh falls to the ground, Jessup turned toward Healy in the street behind him, and raised a gun. “We do know he shot because we can see he shot,” said Nadeau, referring to the hole that appears in a parked car. Police said Friday that the gun they recovered was a Glock 23 with an extended magazine, and that casings on the ground matched rounds found inside its chamber. Officials said the gun, composed of parts of various guns put together, still is being tested. The videos show Jessup falling to the sidewalk amid the sounds of rapid gunfire, as multiple officers ordered him “drop it, drop it.” Officers approached him on the ground and kicked the gun away from his body. Breaking News Alerts Jessup was initially “still conscious and alert,” Nadeau said, but then passed out. Police began administering aid after about a minute and a half and applied a tourniquet, he said. Police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said Friday that officers called for a medic at 12:34 p.m. and an ambulance arrived at 12:39 p.m. She could not immediately provide the time the ambulance left the scene but confirmed an officer was taken to the hospital in a police car. On Oct. 1, under a new law, the attorney general’s office gained the authority to prosecute police in fatal shootings, in-custody deaths or deaths following police pursuits. Previously, the state unit investigated fatalities, but local prosecutors decided whether or not to bring charges against officers. Relatives and friends said Jessup was a “stand up guy” who lived in the area and was about to become a first-time father. [ After Baltimore Police fatally shoot man in Millhill, neighbors question whether foot pursuit was necessary ] Members of the department’s District Action Teams, specialized squads of officers who wear police vests, and can be assigned to patrol or make violent crime arrests, have fired their weapons in two other police shootings this year. The teams also play a role in the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy, although police have said officers were not involved in those activities on Nov. 7. In June, Baltimore officers shot and killed Darryl Gamble, 40, in East Baltimore. Gamble fired at police, according to body camera footage, then officers fired about 40 rounds. Two of the officers who fired were assigned to the Eastern District Action Team and two were Southeast District officers, the attorney general’s office said. Another officer was part of a Southeast/East Side Initiative. Earlier this year, Officer Cedric Elleby shot and injured a 17-year-old in Shipley Hill less than a mile from the scene of the Nov. 7 shooting. Elleby, a District Action Team member, walked up to the teen because he believed he was armed, then chased him after he fled. The officer could be heard in body-camera footage telling the teen to drop his gun before he shot him from behind."

Police Killing Of Black Man And Arrests Of Protesters Outrages Alabama City,2023-11-17,2023-11-18T12:28:57Z,en,blackstarnews.com,https://blackstarnews.com/police-killing-of-black-man-and-arrests-of-protesters-outrages-alabama-city/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118122857id_/https://blackstarnews.com/police-killing-of-black-man-and-arrests-of-protesters-outrages-alabama-city/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118122857/https://blackstarnews.com/police-killing-of-black-man-and-arrests-of-protesters-outrages-alabama-city/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJsYWNrc3Rhcm5ld3MpL3BvbGljZS1raWxsaW5nLW9mLWJsYWNrLW1hbi1hbmQtYXJyZXN0cy1vZi1wcm90ZXN0ZXJzLW91dHJhZ2VzLWFsYWJhbWEtY2l0eQ~~,"Photos: GoFundMe\YouTube Screenshots The Alabama police killing of Stephen Clay Perkins (shown below with family) on September 29th, 2023, is angering many residents in Decatur. In the spring of 1978, police in Decatur, Alabama, arrested 26-year-old Tommy Lee Hines and charged him with raping two white women and robbing one. Before he could be brought to trial, he was charged with the rape of a third white woman. It didnât matter that Hines was at least four inches shorter than a description of the perpetrator, had the mental capacity of a 6-year-old and could neither read nor write the confession that he allegedly signed. He was set to go to trial that October in Cullman, some 40 miles south of Decatur. When the trial date approached, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staged a march from Decatur to Cullman to protest his arrest. Alabama state troopers and members of the Ku Klux Klan met the protesters at the Cullman city limits, where some people were arrested for marching without a permit. The next year, following Hinesâ conviction, marchers in Decatur were attacked by about 100 Klansmen wielding clubs, baseball bats and ax handles, leaving two Klansmen and a Black woman marcher shot in the head and face, and several others injured. That incident led to the Southern Poverty Law Centerâs first civil rights lawsuit against the Klan. Almost a half-century later, descendants of those who marched for Hines are now organizing their own marches, demonstrations and rallies to protest the police shooting death of Stephen Clay Perkins in Decatur. And, like their predecessors, they are being arrested for exercising their First Amendment rights. âOver the course of the times weâve had rallies and demonstrations to protest thereâs been nine arrests,â said Aneesah Saafiyah, one of the organizers with the racial justice group Standing In Power (SIP). Her father, Danny Saafiyah Sr., had been one of the lead organizers during the Hines protests and march. âOur protests havenât been violent. None have been. No one has been attacking the police or anything like that. Itâs just the intimidation tactics that the police use.â Perkins, 39, was shot to death in the early hours of Sept. 29 in front of his home. Initially, police said Perkins refused orders from officers to put down a weapon when a tow truck operator tried to repossess Perkinsâ pickup truck. But security camera footage from neighboring homes tells a different story. In the video footage, after Perkins walks out of his house and yells for the tow operator to put his truck down, two police officers are seen running from the side of Perkinsâ house. âPolice! Get on the ground!â an officer yells immediately before opening fire. At least 18 shots can be heard in the video. Perkins was hit seven times. He was declared dead at a local hospital. Since that fateful 11-second encounter, his family, friends and community have sought answers. âCommunities want to believe that police officers are here to serve and protect everyone,â said Tafeni English-Relf, the SPLCâs Alabama state director. âThey also want to trust law enforcementâs policies and procedures, not be undermined by them. The lack of humanity displayed towards Steve Perkins in front of his home has severely eroded that trust.â The SPLCâs Alabama state office has been working alongside the members of SIP and community leaders to demand justice for Perkins. The SIP has called on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate."

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Ramsey County District Court in St. Paul, says once the investigation into a deadly force incident is completed and a prosecutor decides not to charge the officers, the data legally should be turned over to the families of the deceased within 10 days of them requesting it. Prosecutors in all five cases cleared the officers of wrongdoing. But the lawsuit says the BCA still hasn’t met its legal obligations to the families. An agency spokesperson said the BCA releases information to families as quickly as it can. Not only would getting the files help provide some closure, but the long delays make it hard for families to file wrongful death lawsuits within the state’s three-year statute of limitations, Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said. The plaintiffs include the family of Tekele Sundberg, who was experiencing a mental health crisis when he was killed by Minneapolis police snipers July 14, 2022, after an overnight standoff in which he allegedly fired shots. His death stoked activists’ distrust of police in the city where George Floyd was killed by an officer in 2020. His mother, Cindy Sundberg, told reporters that Thursday would have been his 22nd birthday. âHe should be here celebrating. We should be asking him what he wants for his birthday dinner. It’s been 16 months. We still have not seen the details, and seen all the information, despite trying to get the information,” Sundberg said. âWe grieve the loss of our son. Itâs unbearable.â The family of Zachary Shogren said police knew their son, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, was suffering from PTSD and schizophrenia when task force officers shot and killed him in Duluth after he ran toward them with a knife on Feb. 24, 2023. His father, Jim Shogren, said they were trying to get their son the help he needed, but he was shot within a minute after the confrontation began. âThe police knew all this information. They knew of his mental illness,” said his mother, Jenny Shogren. âAnd it ended so fast for Zach. And we’re just devastated. We’ve cried a million tears for our son. He served his country for nine years. He was supposed to be brought to the hospital to get help, not to be pronounced dead.â The BCA said it’s committed to informing families and the public as quickly as possible while protecting data that it can’t release under state law. âWe understand that families who have experienced these tragic losses would want all of the information that they can have as soon as possible, BCA spokesperson Jill Oliveira said in a statement. âOnce a case is closed, the BCA must review every report, image, audio and video in the casefile to ensure that information that isnât public is removed as required under Minnesota law. This requires review of dash camera, body-worn camera, and surveillance video; all other images and audio of the incident; and voluminous reports.” The lawsuit also names the families of Dolal Idd, who was killed by Minneapolis police at a gas station Dec. 20, 2020, after they said he fired at them during a gun purchase sting. Okwan Sims, who was shot by Stillwater police officers investigating a report of shots fired at an apartment complex March 4, 2023; and Brent Alsleben, who was killed by Hutchinson police officers Dec. 15, 2022. The statute of limitations for Idd’s family to file a wrongful death lawsuit expires at the end of next month, said Paul Bosman, an attorney for the families. He said the case files can run from 1,500 to 2,500 pages, so families and their lawyers need time to review them before time runs out, but they keep getting stonewalled on their requests. âWe’ve heard all sorts of explanations about how they’re just too much work to do. They apparently hired several more attorneys to do review in the last year, they’ve had to train those people. That is not our concern. We have families who are entitled to this data.â Gross said the open records law requires government agencies to be transparent with their data."

Taylor was killed at her boyfriend’s apartment on March 13, 2020 when she was shot during a “no-knock” drug raid by police. After Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a single shot, hitting one of the officers in the leg, three officers shot back. Hankison fired 10 times but did not hit Taylor. Hankison, 47, was charged with using excessive force that violated the rights of Breonna Taylor, her boyfriend and her next-door neighbors. During closing arguments, federal prosecutor Michael Songer said Hankison knew he shouldn’t have fired his gun wildly without seeing a target. After deliberating for several days, the 12 members of the jury told U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings they were at an impasse. After they returned to deliberations, the jurors told the judge Thursday they were deadlocked on both counts against Hankison. The charges carried a maximum sentence of life in prison. However, federal prosecutors could still pursue a retrial. In 2022, Hankison was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment for firing a shot the went into a neighboring apartment but didn’t hit anyone. He was dismissed from the department in 2020."

They claim the BCA broke Minnesota's data practices law by not providing them information from completed use-of-force investigations within 10 days of their requests. Some families said they have waited months for the BCA to respond to their requests. One â Dolal Idd's family â has waited for nearly three years â the maximum time allowed to pass before Minnesota's statute of limitations prevents people from filing wrongful death lawsuits. BCA representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Families of Idd, Zachary Shogren, Okwan Sims, Tekle Sundberg and Brent Alsleben gathered in the Ramsey County Courthouse on Thursday to announce the lawsuit. Many wore shirts and carried photos of the dead, fighting back tears while describing the deep impact the deaths made in their lives. Idd's father, Bayle Gelle, said Minneapolis police raided his home the night he learned about his son's death. Gelle recalled collapsing in tears from the news. ""I was scared. ... They terrorized us,"" Gelle said, claiming that officers told him to sit down and shut up. One officer allegedly pointed a gun at his 4-year-old son. ""If there is any justice in Minnesota, we need to get [it]."" The families are represented by the litigation unit of Communities United Against Police Brutality, a volunteer organization launched nearly two decades ago to address police brutality in Minnesota. CUAPB President Michelle Gross said the lawsuit may be the first of its kind against the BCA. If so, it could affect data requests from families of other people killed by officers across the state. ""The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension just keeps saying, 'We don't have time to give [the data] to you. We're too busy.' Or in some cases [it] doesn't even answer the request at all. ... They shouldn't be able to hide behind that. That harms everybody,"" Gross said. ""Anybody whose family member was killed in an encounter with law enforcement would want to know what happened, and I think that's a right they have."" Gross said her organization has asked state legislators several times to extend the statute of limitations to six years or erase it entirely, but have been unsuccessful. State law says that most government data is public. Data for investigations against people are confidential as long as a case is active, and a case becomes inactive when an agency or prosecutor decides not to pursue the case further. Private or confidential data can be provided to the person involved in the data or to a representative, such as surviving spouses, children or parents, if the person is dead. However there are caveats around releasing sensitive information which could be analyzed and interpreted in court. According to a Star Tribune database, at least 230 Minnesotans have been killed in law enforcement encounters since 2000. Families involved in the lawsuit lost their loved ones as the pandemic surged and receded. A Minneapolis police warrant claims officers tried to arrest Idd after attempting a gun sting on Dec. 30, 2020. A gunfight ensued and Idd reportedly shot at police before they returned fire, killing him. Family members questioned the incident and hundreds marched through south Minneapolis to protest Idd's death. The Dakota County Attorney's Office chose to not charge the three officers involved, ruling that their shooting was legally justified. Sundberg was killed on July 14, 2022, after reports of shots fired from Sundberg's apartment launched an overnight standoff. Family members say he was having a mental health emergency, and requested more body camera footage from officers involved in the shooting. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office said Sundberg's death was a tragedy, but announced it would not press charges against officers involved in his shooting. Law enforcement killed Alsleben, a man with a history of mental health struggles, after a welfare check escalated into an hourslong standoff on Dec. 15, 2022. Alsleben reportedly swung a knife and cut an officer before they fatally shot him. The Sibley County Attorney's Office ruled that officers' use of force was justified. Duluth police shot and killed Shogren in February after trying to arrest him on suspicion of felony threats of violence. Body camera footage suggests Shogren ran at officers with a knife raised before they fired, killing him in an alley. The St. Louis County Attorney's Office announced in August that the officer who fired the fatal shot would face no criminal charges. Sims was fatally shot by Stillwater police in March after reports of gunfire and of Sims shooting a woman who entered his apartment. Authorities say Sims struck at least two squad cars when he fired at responding officers. They returned fire, striking and killing Sims outside of his apartment building. The Washington County Attorney's Office said no charges would be pressed against officers who shot Sims. If the lawsuit is successful, the BCA could foot the bill for family members' attorney fees, reported losses and ""exemplary damages"" for breaking Minnesota's data practices law. Family at the Thursday news conference said they hope the action brings closure. For Tara Sykes, mother of Alsleben, closure could mean getting back her late son's personal possessions and class ring â which she said are still with the BCA. ""That is something that I would like. I know that my son had [a] class ring, he had a watch, he had bracelets, he had things that are very personal to us,"" Sykes said. ""I still haven't received those."""
Colorado sergeant who OKed use of force against Christian Glass sentenced to probation,2023-11-16,2023-11-18T01:58:56Z,en,denverpost.com,https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/16/christian-glass-shooting-clear-creek-sheriff-sergeant-kyle-gould-probation/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118015856id_/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/16/christian-glass-shooting-clear-creek-sheriff-sergeant-kyle-gould-probation/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118015856/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/16/christian-glass-shooting-clear-creek-sheriff-sergeant-kyle-gould-probation/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGRlbnZlcnBvc3QpLzIwMjMvMTEvMTYvY2hyaXN0aWFuLWdsYXNzLXNob290aW5nLWNsZWFyLWNyZWVrLXNoZXJpZmYtc2VyZ2VhbnQta3lsZS1nb3VsZC1wcm9iYXRpb24~,"A former Clear Creek County sheriff’s sergeant will not serve any jail time for his role in the killing of 22-year-old Christian Glass, a Boulder man who was shot by police after he called 911 for help while stuck on the side of the road and experiencing a mental health crisis. Kyle Gould, 37, pleaded guilty to failing to intervene in the excessive use of force by another officer in Clear Creek district court on Thursday. He was sentenced to two years of probation and a $1,000 fine for the misdemeanor charge. Gould must withdraw his Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training certification and is barred from ever working as a law enforcement officer or security personnel under the plea deal. Gould was initially charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment after he and former Clear Creek Sheriff’s Deputy Andrew Buen were indicted by a grand jury in November 2022. Buen pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and official misconduct on Nov. 2. Gould was not at the scene when Glass was shot on June 11, 2022, but he still bore responsibility for Glass’ death, Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Potts told the court Thursday. Glass called 911 after crashing his car on an embankment in Silver Plume and told the dispatcher he was afraid of “skinwalkers” and people chasing him, according to earlier reporting. Buen was among seven law enforcement officers from multiple agencies who responded to the call and spent an hour trying to coax Glass out of his car while he was experiencing delusions and paranoia. Officers escalated the situation and made it worse, Potts said, and when Buen contacted his supervisor, Gould, Gould authorized the actions that led to Glass’ death. “Mr. Gould had the opportunity to prevent this,” Potts said. “All the law enforcement officers at the scene had the opportunity to prevent this, and the fact is that they didn’t. If they had, we wouldn’t be here today.” While Gould was not physically present at the scene, Potts added, his authority was present. “I think all the officers who were there probably bear some responsibility for the death of Christian Glass,” Potts said. Glass’ parents, Simon and Sally Glass, spoke through tears about how the loss of their son has impacted their lives. Attempts by law enforcement to cover up what happened to Christian Glass marred his family’s ability to grieve, Simon Glass said in court. “Instead of grieving and perhaps celebrating his short life, we were stunned and confused,” Simon Glass said. “Christian’s brutal torture and murder has destroyed our family. It will never be the same.” Sally Glass said her son had gotten stuck on rocks and just wanted help. “I hope that Mr. Gould now and throughout his life will think about being kinder and more compassionate to people that are in trouble,” she said. The Glass family has already reached a record $19 million settlement against the state of Colorado and three local law enforcement agencies in Christian Glass’ death. Gould’s attorney, Bob Weiner, said there was no cover-up by Gould, but he would not debate the facts of the case. “We’ve accepted responsibility,” he said. “Mr. Gould is giving up his right to be a peace officer and doesn’t want to fight this out of respect for the Glass family and his desire to move on with his life.” Weiner said Gould was at home in bed when he authorized the use of force “after all other negotiating tools were exhausted” and drove to the scene when he realized the situation wasn’t being resolved. Gould did not speak during the hearing except to answer questions from District Court Judge Catherine Cheroutes. Gould could have been sentenced to up to 364 days in jail, but the plea agreement recommended two years of probation. Cheroutes said while she thought a jail sentence would be appropriate, she would not impose one for the benefit of everyone being able to move on in the case. “Hopefully this plea deters and teaches law enforcement about what the consequences are of their actions,” Cheroutes said.

Families of 5 men killed in officer-involved shootings sue BCA over case file delays,2023-11-16,2023-11-18T11:59:11Z,en,twincities.com,https://www.twincities.com/2023/11/16/families-of-5-men-killed-in-officer-involved-shootings-sue-bca-over-case-file-delays/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118115911id_/https://www.twincities.com/2023/11/16/families-of-5-men-killed-in-officer-involved-shootings-sue-bca-over-case-file-delays/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231118115911/https://www.twincities.com/2023/11/16/families-of-5-men-killed-in-officer-involved-shootings-sue-bca-over-case-file-delays/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHR3aW5jaXRpZXMpLzIwMjMvMTEvMTYvZmFtaWxpZXMtb2YtNS1tZW4ta2lsbGVkLWluLW9mZmljZXItaW52b2x2ZWQtc2hvb3RpbmdzLXN1ZS1iY2Etb3Zlci1jYXNlLWZpbGUtZGVsYXlz,"Families of five Minnesota men fatally shot by law enforcement allege in a lawsuit filed this week that the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has not given them full investigation data, despite the cases being closed.  Dolal Idd, Zachary Shogren, Okwan Sims, Tekle Sundberg and Brent Alsleben’s families held a news conference Thursday at the Ramsey County Courthouse to announce the lawsuit against the Department of Public Safety, which oversees the BCA.  The lawsuit claims the BCA violated the state’s public records law, known as the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act. When a deadly force investigation is done and if a prosecutor decides not to charge the officers, the case file must be made available to families within 10 days of their request, the lawsuit says.  According to the lawsuit, in each of the five cases, requests were made by the parents of the deceased men after no charges were filed against officers. However, the BCA has “failed to comply with the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act in each of these cases, and has unreasonably delayed the release of data to the plaintiffs,” the lawsuit states.  Families have waited several months to more than two years for the BCA to fulfill their data requests, said Michelle Gross, Communities United Against Police Brutality president. The families are represented by the litigation unit of the CUAPB, an all-volunteer organization that was formed in December 2000 in the aftermath of the shooting death of Charles “Abuka” Sanders by Minneapolis police.  Withholding of data threatens the ability of families to seek wrongful death lawsuits because the statute of limitations for such suits is three years, the lawsuit says. In the case of Bayle Gelle, whose son, Dolal Idd, was killed by Minneapolis police, the statute of limitations expires Dec. 30.  “It’s outlandish to me, personally, that these families have waited so long,” Gross said, adding she is not aware of a similar lawsuit ever filed in the state on behalf of families.  The BCA “has made a litany of excuses” for not releasing data to the families, Gross said.  “One of the big ones is ‘we don’t have enough people to do this work,’ even though they were given a very significant amount of money, not in this last legislative session, but in 2022, in which to hire additional people to do this work,” Gross said.  BCA says they must review full file before release  The BCA understands that families “who have experienced these tragic losses would want all of the information that they can have as soon as possible,” BCA spokeswoman Jill Oliveira said in an emailed statement Thursday.  Once a case is closed, the BCA must review every report, image, audio and video in the file to ensure that information that isn’t public is removed as required under state law, Oliveira said.  “This requires review of dash camera, body-worn camera, and surveillance video; all other images and audio of the incident; and voluminous reports,” she said.  The BCA is “committed to providing information to families and the public as quickly as possible, while ensuring the protection of information that we cannot release under Minnesota law,” Oliveira said.  Dad of man killed in Stillwater waiting for answers  Several family members wore shirts of those killed or held photos of them as they spoke about how they have been affected by their loss and not getting full information from the BCA.  Ovid Sims, father of Okwan Sims, drove from his home in Dallas to be at the courthouse on Thursday. “I just want justice and answers for my son,” he said.  Sims, 21, was fatally shot March 4 in the parking lot of a Stillwater apartment complex by two Stillwater police officers responding to an “active-shooter” call, authorities said. The BCA said Sims first shot a woman in the knee in his apartment and then fired dozens of shots at officers in the parking lot before being shot three times.  Washington County Attorney Kevin Magnuson announced Aug. 10 in a news release that he was declining to press charges against the involved officers because the “use of force was justified.”  Magnuson said in the release that his decision came after prosecutors reviewed an extensive investigative file from the BCA consisting of more than “2,000 pages of reports, dozens of photographs, and hours of video and audio evidence.”  According to this week’s lawsuit, Ovid Sims and his attorney, Paul Bosman, CUAPB chief counsel, submitted a data request to the BCA through an Aug. 10 email for “all records related to your investigation into the use of deadly force” against Okwan Sims. Five days later, the BCA told Sims in an email that the case was still an active criminal investigation.  Sims met with members of the BCA at their office on Aug 28 to review body-camera footage and other documents from the case file and was told by agents that he could not bring any of the data home with him, the lawsuit says.  “The BCA agents told Mr. Bosman that Mr. Sims’ case file was ‘voluminous’ and required redaction before it could be released,” the lawsuit states. “It has been over two months since the prosecuting authority declined to press charges and since the date of Mr. Sim’s request for data from the BCA.”  Lawsuit asks judge to order files’ release  Hutchinson police shot and killed 34-year-old Alsleben at his apartment in New Auburn on Dec. 15, 2022, while he was in the midst of a mental health crisis, according to the lawsuit. The BCA said Alsleben displayed a knife and swung it at the first responders. A standoff ensued, with McLeod County deputies and Hutchinson police officers also arriving at the scene.  When they tried to take him into custody, he struggled and cut one of the officers. Two McLeod County deputies attempted without success to use their Tasers. Alsleben then stood up, still holding the knife, and three Hutchinson officers fired, fatally striking him.  Last March, after the Sibley County Attorney declined to press charges against the three involved officers, Alsleben’s mother, Tara Sykes, emailed a data request to the BCA for the entire investigatory file into the death of her son, the lawsuit says.  The BCA responded on March 20 that they received the email, adding “please know the case is now closed and your request is in the queue,” the lawsuit states. “Due to the large number of data requests the BCA receives, we cannot give you a timeframe for completion. However, the BCA will be in contact with you once your request is complete.”  The BCA has not released any of the public information related to Alsleben’s case nor given the family a timeline of when the data will be released, the lawsuit says.  To make matters worse, Sykes said Thursday, the BCA has not released her son’s personal belongings, including a class ring. “He had things that are very personal to us, and I still haven’t received those,” she said."

About 100 protestors -- who chanted, brandished posters and even dressed up as Milburn Pennybags from Monopoly -- could not protect the land under a new state law passed that effectively forces the start of the state leasing program.  (The same law expanded the legal definition of “green energy” to include natural gas.)  That’s despite the fact that more than 100 Ohioans said their names were used without their knowing consent on letters to the commission supporting fracking.  While the Ohio Oil and Gas Association plans to “continue to review” new provisions to its standard lease agreement aimed at limiting noise from drilling operations during hunting season, a lawsuit seeks to overturn Ohio’s land leasing law.

Andrew Tobias and Jeremy Pelzer report Huffman expressed interest in banning abortion after 15 weeks into pregnancy, something that some Republicans have gravitated toward as a potentially less-controversial alternative to a full abortion ban or a six-week ban like the one Ohio Republicans passed in 2019.  Marijuana rules: Senate President Matt Huffman said Wednesday that senators aim to pass legislation early next month to make a number of changes to Issue 2, the state’s new marijuana legalization law before parts of the new voter-passed law take effect, report Laura Hancock and Jeremy Pelzer.

LaRose finances: Secretary of State Frank LaRose has gently mocked his wealthy opponents in March’s Republican Senate primary election by referring to himself as a humble “thousandaire.” They’ve responded by questioning where LaRose got the $250,000 he personally loaned to his financially strapped campaign last month. Andrew Tobias reports the public will have to wait for details, since a federal deadline for a mandatory financial disclosure passed Tuesday without a report from LaRose.

Just before 8 p.m. Oct. 1, officers were called to the 1400 block of 116th Avenue about a man throwing things off a balcony and damaging cars in the parking lot, according to a news release from the Westminster Police Department.  When the first officer, identified in the news release as Officer Robb Phelps, arrived, three apartment residents had a man pinned to the ground, and a fourth resident told the officer the man was screaming and hitting walls, the footage shows.  The officer asked the man to lay down on his stomach with his hands out and began reaching for his Taser, then the footage shows the man reached into his pocket and grabbed a gun.  Phelps tased the man and yelled for him to drop the gun. One of the residents can also be seen appearing to try and wrestle the gun out of the man’s hand.  The officer continued yelling commands at the man and asked the resident to move away from the man. The man appeared to point the gun at the resident during the struggle.  Phelps then fired one round that hit the man, and the resident got the gun out of the man’s hand and threw it on the ground, the footage shows.  The man then fell over onto the ground, and a second officer who arrived later at the scene attempted life-saving measures on the man a couple of minutes later.  Phelps told another officer the resident trying to get the gun out of the man’s hand “appeared in danger” when the officer fired his weapon, according to the footage.  According to the news release, the man was taken to the hospital where he died.

The plea agreement for Ryan, who retired as corrections director in September 2019, calls for a sentence of probation and an $8,500 payment to cover the Tempe Police Department's costs in conducting the investigation. The offense carries a maximum sentence of up to two years in prison. Sentencing is set for Jan. 11. Police were called to the house on Jan. 6, 2022, on a report that Ryan had shot himself in the hand. It was later revealed by police that the hand injury was caused by a less-than-lethal projectile shot by police after Ryan pointed a handgun at officers. They say the projectile was found during surgery. Ryan also was injured when he fired his gun before police arrived. He apparently suffered a cut to the forehead after a bullet hit a bathroom sink and sent a splinter of porcelain flying. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Police reports say Ryan had consumed a half bottle of tequila by the time officers arrived at his property. Police say Ryan slurred his words and was antagonistic toward a police negotiator, did not know why officers were at his home, or know what happened to his injured hand. Ryan also told police he didn’t remember pointing a gun at officers and acknowledged drinking tequila that evening, though he said he had just two shots. Outside of court, Ryan declined to comment on his plea. Craig Penrod, attorney for Ryan, told the judge during the hearing that the no-contest plea was in the public’s best interest. “He has no specific recollection of the events,” Penrod said.

Police said Ryan told hospital staff that the cut was the result of an earlier fall, though the injury looked fresh. Ryan was never booked into jail after eventually surrendering to police and being taken to the hospital. Officers seized about 15 guns from his home. Ryan’s tenure as corrections director was controversial. A federal magistrate judge found him in contempt of court for not following through on promises in a legal settlement to improve health care for prisoners. He was previously criticized after the 2009 heat-related death of a prisoner who was left for nearly four hours in an unshaded outdoor holding cell during triple-digit heat. Advertisement Article continues below this ad About five years later, prison officials were accused of botching the execution of Joseph Wood, who was given 15 doses of a two-drug combination over nearly two hours. Ryan also came under criticism in 2014 by a prison teacher who was raped after being left alone with a prisoner who was a sex offender. The teacher said Ryan allowed lax training, staffing shortages and poor security at the prison. Later in Ryan's tenure, the corrections department was rocked by revelations that prisoners at the Lewis prison complex west of Phoenix were able to open their locked cell doors and attack corrections officers and other prisoners."

Good Samaritan John Lally told local Fox affiliate KRIV that he pulled up to a crash site on Highway 59 in order to help any accident victims, but he soon realized he walked into a gunfight between a lawman and a car thief. Houston police said Officer J. Gibson was shot in the leg Saturday while approaching the suspect, who crashed the stolen car while being chased by police. “That’s when I grabbed that cop by his vest and dragged him all the way back to my work truck,” Mr. Lally told KRIV. Mr. Lally sat with Officer Gibson while a tourniquet was wrapped around his wound. Authorities said the 19-year-old suspect hopped into another car and tried to get into a second vehicle, but eventually was shot by police multiple times. The suspect later died at a hospital. Police said Officer Gibson is expected to fully recover. • Matt Delaney can be reached at mdelaney@washingtontimes.com. Copyright © 2023 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

Pink Croc sales were likely up last month, according to his father, John Wettlaufer. Dozens of fraternity brothers and others bought them to wear for the younger Wettlaufer’s funeral in October, John Wettlaufer told MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette. People shared stories of the WMU student who died recently as a nice guy with a great sense of humor, athletic skills and musical talent. Wettlaufer, 19, a sophomore studying finance at Western Michigan University, had a bright future ahead of him. Wettlaufer was found dead Saturday, Sept. 30, outside the fraternity where he lived, 1714 Fraternity Village Drive. The Pi Kappa Alpha’s Epsilon Psi house is not far from WMU’s main campus in Kalamazoo. An autopsy report describes Wettlaufer’s death as an accident caused by the combined toxic effects of ethanol (alcohol) and cocaine. The elder Wettlaufer, 55, doesn’t point fingers for what happened to his son, he said in an interview with MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette on Nov. 10. “If you were ever in college and you saw somebody that maybe drank too much and he’s just sleeping it off, you just say, ‘Oh my gosh, he’s loaded,’” Wettlaufer said, speaking through emotions after losing his son. “So I can’t blame the guys. They didn’t know. And I don’t think anybody found him until it was too late.” Jimmy Wettlaufer had a standing Facetime call with his parents. The last one, the Sunday before his death, he talked about typical college things. He was thinking of switching a class he felt he could be more successful in, talked about fraternity activities and said the pledge class was going to be really large. They texted, like they normally do, on the night before his death. Student found dead outside A fraternity member and resident found Wettlaufer laying alongside a wooden railing of the balcony about 8:45 a.m. on Sept. 30 and called police, the police report says. An officer woke up another fraternity resident to ask for security camera footage. But the camera overlooking the outdoor balcony was without a battery at the time of the death. That person told the officer he had a Snapchat message from Wettlaufer and opened it. The report states, “He then began showing off a handle of a clear intoxicant and stated something to the effect of, ‘If I don`t get up, this is why, you have permission to shake me awake if you need to.’ Wettlaufer appeared happy and in good spirits as he jokingly stated this to the camera.” “He then spent several moments binge drinking the alcohol until the container was completely empty,” the police report states. Witnesses told police the message was sent to a group chat for all fraternity members, the police report says, and it was not part of his Snapchat “story.” The officer recorded the video on his body camera, as it was expected the video would automatically be deleted from Snapchat. Wettlaufer’s message was sent at 3:36 a.m., according to other people interviewed by police. The police report does not detail how many people saw the message, or when. A man and woman told police they both spoke to Wettlaufer around 3 a.m., before they went to bed, and he told them he was going outside to sit on the balcony and listen to music. The woman told police Wettlaufer promised to stop drinking, and the bottle of vodka he was drinking still had some shots left in it. Two samples from after his death showed a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.544% and 0.447%, the report states. With a BAC of greater than 0.4%, patients can develop respiratory depression followed by coma or death. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%, while people are considered “super drunk” when above 0.17%. Alcohol in the form of ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) is found in alcoholic beverages. Ethyl alcohol poisoning generally comes from drinking too much alcohol over a short time period, the Mayo Clinic says. Cocaine showed up in his blood in the amount of 50.2 nanograms per milliliter, just above the test detection limit of 50 nanograms per milliliter. Based on conversations with the medical examiner’s office, Wettlaufer said he doesn’t believe cocaine had as much to do with his son’s death as the alcohol. He also believes there wasn’t enough cash going out of his accounts for cocaine usage to have been a long-term problem for his son. Hard liquor prohibited Wettlaufer graduated from Nequa Valley High School in Illinois in 2022 with a scholar designation. After high school, he moved to Kalamazoo for college and joined a fraternity. The Kalamazoo chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha could not be reached for comment. The group’s national headquarters did not respond to a request for comment. A man who answered the door at the fraternity house on Monday said he was advised to politely say no comment, when asked about Wettlaufer. The fraternity’s website offers guidance to its members on issues including drinking, with a rule banning liquor with alcohol content of above 15% on premises. “The chapter or members shall not permit, encourage, coerce, glorify or participate in any activities involving the rapid consumption of alcohol, such as drinking games,” the national organization’s website says. The Western Michigan University Interfraternity Council, which Pi Kappa Alpha is a member of, also bans drinks above 15% alcohol by volume on its premises. Wettlaufer had a history of alcohol use disorder, the autopsy says. It is a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use, despite adverse social, occupational or health consequences. Nearly 29 million adults (11.3% of adults) had alcohol use disorder in 2021. A bright and accomplished student Wettlaufer’s obituary states he had been on the honor roll at WMU. He was also a second-degree black belt, an exercise enthusiast and a bicyclist, his obituary states. He had just obtained an internship, the police report says. The fraternity posted a memorial message highlighting his life, and said Wettlaufer will be remembered as an exceptional leader and a shining precedent for its members. “Jim will forever be remembered for the little things, such as his love for music, playing guitar or making everyone laugh at a moment’s notice,” the group posted on Facebook Monday, Oct. 2. Family members cherished the time they spent with him, the obit states. “The absence of Jimmy’s radiant presence is deeply felt, but the love, laughter and memories he shared will forever echo in our hearts,” the obituary says. “Rest in peace, dear Jimmy.” It’s tragic when a student’s life ends short, said Reetha Raveendran, WMU associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students. “This is a painful loss for his family, but also for his peers and other members of our campus,” Raveendran said in a statement on behalf of the university. “For those who are left behind, we care for them through the mental health services available to our community, and we have a point person in the dean of students’ office who stays in touch with peers who are directly impacted.” WMU offers resources for students related to substance use and abuse. The university’s website advises people to seek substance abuse counseling if students are experiencing chronic hangovers, having difficulty studying, blacking out from drinking or concerned about a friend’s substance use, among other reasons. WMU’s Office of Student Engagement provides education programming to fraternities and sororities about harmful or risky behavior, including substance use, the university said. The WMU Department of Public Safety also has alcohol awareness and safety programs. The university has a bystander intervention program to train students how to intervene when they see high-risk drinking and other harmful behaviors, and another system to report concerns about another student’s welfare. ‘I don’t blame them at all’ As loved ones gathered for Jimmy Wettlaufer’s funeral the week after his death, about 90 fraternity brothers attended the ceremony in Illinois, John Wettlaufer said. He and others have asked themselves over and over again about what someone could have done differently. It happened in the middle of the night, he said, and nobody was around. “The takeaway I had for the boys was, ‘Take care of each other,’” Wettlaufer said. “If something doesn’t look right, don’t say, ‘Oh, it’ll be OK.’ Don’t brush it under the rug.” He spoke the message to the roomful of fraternity brothers and others attending his son’s funeral. “I don’t blame them at all, and there is nothing to blame,” Wettlaufer said. “This wasn’t a drinking game ... or any of that.” The tragedy came as a surprise. His son was often the voice of reason to others, Wettlaufer said. People on his tribute wall commented on his “bright” and “positive” personality. “Take care of each other,” Wettlaufer said again, remembering what he said in a speech at the funeral. “These are all your friends.” Sometimes, young people don’t want to get involved because they think they might get in trouble, he said. “If it doesn’t look right, say something to somebody,” Wettlaufer said. It is a huge loss, the elder Wettlaufer said. He knows they’ll never get the answers they are seeking. For most people, their bad experience with alcohol ends with waking up sick the next morning. “Unfortunately that didn’t happen for my son,” Wettlaufer said. “And we lost a great kid.” Most Popular Stories by Brad Devereaux - Amazon announces its first Michigan solar farm project - ‘Take care of each other,’ says father of WMU student who died at frat house - Police identify 2 killed in Kalamazoo County crash, share details on incident - ‘Officer-involved shooting’ reported in Southwest Michigan - Shooting under investigation in Kalamazoo"

Three-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in 2024 will face the winner of the Republican primary, state Sen. Matt Dolan, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose or businessman Bernie Moreno, all of whom are anti-abortion. LaRose and Moreno have called for national legislation banning abortion at 15 weeks, while Dolan said he might consider federal legislation if enough states pass Issue 1-type measures. Issue 1 in Ohio last week showed signs of broad political support for abortion rights, winning in 18 counties where ex-President Donald Trump won in 2020. Those include some formerly reliably Democratic counties in Northeast Ohio that have drifted toward Republicans in the Trump era. The key, writes Andrew Tobias, is the extent to which Ohio voters support the Democratic position on issues like abortion or marijuana legalization, while supporting Republicans on other issues, like immigration or government spending. - Laura Overnight Scores and Weather Northeast Ohio weather forecast: More sun and mild temperatures Top stories Senate race: The Issue 1 election results foreshadow the case Democrats can make for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown next year as the bulwark against GOP efforts to impose some kind of national abortion ban. The U.S. Senate is closely divided in favor of Democrats and Brownâs seat will be among the handful of most hotly contested races, reports Andrew Tobias. Recreational marijuana: Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens indicatedÂ Tuesday that heâsÂ in no rush to pass major changes to the stateâs new recreational marijuana legalization law, parts of which take effect next month. Jeremy Pelzer reports that the only part of the new law, passed by voters last week, that takes effect on Dec. 7 is allowing Ohioans age 21 or older to grow up to six marijuana plants in their home (or up to 12 plants if at least two adults live in the home). Today in Ohio: The campaign to increase Cuyahoga Countyâs cigarette tax for the arts is on hold at a critical moment because ofÂ rising community discontentÂ over the public agency charged with distributing more than $11 million a year in revenues.Â WeâreÂ talking about the infighting among Cuyahoga Arts & Culture on Today in Ohio, cleveland.comâsÂ daily half-hour podcast. Statehouse and Politics Power separation: A pair of top Ohio Republicans are throwing cold water on some GOP lawmakersâ hopes to pass legislation stripping Ohio judges of the power to rule on the stateâs new abortion-rights amendment. Jeremy Pelzer reports that Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens said Tuesday that he does not consider the proposal, which would directly challenge the traditional separation of powers between the stateâs legislative and judicial branches, to be serious legislation. Recreational marijuana: All but one place in Cuyahoga County voted yes to legalize adult-use marijuana in Ohio, according to unofficial election results, reports Zachary Smith. The smallest support was in Linndale, where 48% of voters supported legalization. However, with only 25 total voters on the issue, that only amounted to 12 yes votes and 13 no votes. Tax credit: An Ohio Senate committee is considering a bill that would give individuals and businesses a tax credit for donations to crisis pregnancy centers â a week after a majority of Ohio voters decided to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Laura Hancock reports thatÂ Senate Bill 159 would cost the state between $3 million and $10 million a year. Death penalty: The families of murder victims are pushing Ohio lawmakers to end the death penalty. They continue to fight executions in Ohio, saying the appeals process makes the cases agonizing for family members, reports Molly Walsh. Diabetes month:Â U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown and a group of her Congressional Black Caucus colleagues on MondayÂ marked National Diabetes Month by highlighting how the disease disproportionately affects Black Americans and calling for greater action to help reduce diabeticsâ medical costs.

Paris Wolfe reports the two are husband and wife. Peopleâs budget:Â Issue 38, Clevelandâs Peopleâs Budget charter amendment, was a tight race, but the ânoâ side -- backed by City Council and labor unions -- eked out a narrow victory. Courtney Astolfi and Zachary Smith report that precinct-level results show a similarly tight race in many of the cityâs neighborhoods, but some clear voting patterns emerged. Levy request: Cuyahoga County voters are all but certain to have the option to renew the countyâs 4.8-mill Health and Human Services levy when they cast ballots in March. The levy funds the countyâs social safety net, subsidizing dozens of departments and programs throughout the county, Lucas Daprile reports. Park burn:Â Plans to conductÂ controlled burns at three locations in the Cuyahoga Valley National ParkÂ have been scrubbed because workers assigned to carry out the prescribed fires have been pulled away on an emergency, reports Peter Krouse. Calling all artists: Cuyahoga County wants to hear your ideas about how the lower level of the Veterans Memorial Bridge could be used for âan innovative and immersive public experienceâ in June, Steven Litt reports. The artist or group that submits the winning proposal will receive $50,000 to make the vision a reality. Leaf blowers: A grassroots organization in Cleveland Heights that calls itselfÂ Quiet Clean HeightsÂ is hoping to silence one of the most pervasive sounds of fall: the grinding growl of the gas-powered leaf blower.Â The loosely organized group is part of theÂ Quiet Clean Alliance, made up of similarly motivated groups concerned about the noise, healthÂ and environmental impacts of gas-powered leaf blowers, reports Peter Krouse.

Russell called police at 12:55 p.m. Tuesday asking for the suicide hotline, police said. He hung up the phone as dispatchers began asking follow-up questions. Police tracked the location of the call to a home in the 6200 block of Hathaway Road. Upon arrival, officers said Russellâs wife answered the door and said her husband was in the basement alone. Officers found Russell, 67, sitting on a couch with a firearm in his hand threatening to commit suicide, police said. âOfficers on scene requested additional resources to be dispatched, including crisis intervention negotiators and medical personnel,â police said Wednesday in a Facebook post. âOfficers spoke with the male for about 10 minutes trying to convince him to put the gun down.â Police said Russell then pointed the gun at the officers, prompting them to fire their weapons. Russell was transported to Marymount Hospital, where he died. No officers sustained injuries. The two officers who fired their weapons were placed on paid administrative leave.

Mr. Jones was killed in 2013 by five officers as he lay motionless on the ground between a stone wall and the wall of officers who teased, punched, kicked and choked him, before killing him in a barrage of 22 gunshots. In its powerful 2020 opinion, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit pushed back against the increasingly intolerable consequences of qualified immunity, a court-invented doctrine used as both shield and sword to block accountability for police violence and strip victims of their rights to redress. “Although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split-second decisions,” the Jones Court ruled, “we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of Black lives.” On Dec. 4, the Maryland Supreme Court will have an opportunity to address this crisis of impunity when it hears a case in which lower courts radically expanded the reach of qualified immunity to excuse the horrific police shooting of a 5-year-old child trapped amid police gunfire that killed his mother. After Korryn Gaines — a young Black woman experiencing mental health challenges — missed a court date for minor traffic tickets, heavily armed Baltimore County police kicked in the door of her home and found her with a gun, leading to a prolonged standoff. As Ms. Gaines huddled in her apartment with her 5-year-old son Kodi, more than 30 officers, police snipers and armor-clad SWAT units swarmed the apartment complex, with at least four armed officers stationed just outside Ms. Gaines’ door. The ensuing standoff continued for six hours. Then, a “hot” and “frustrated” Officer Royce Ruby — triggered when Ms. Gaines followed Kodi into the kitchen to make him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich — shot her in the back, killing her, leaving Kodi and his sister Karsyn motherless. Although the jury later found Ms. Gaines posed no threat to anyone, Officer Ruby aimed for her head, shooting through the kitchen wall with full knowledge that Kodi was just on the other side. The bullet from the high-powered rifle exited his mother’s body, ricocheted off the refrigerator, and struck Kodi in the face. Another bullet hit Kodi’s arm when Officer Ruby fired additional shots into his mortally wounded mother, all causing Kodi grievous injury and unimaginable emotional trauma. After a three-week trial in 2018, a Baltimore County jury found the police killing of Ms. Gaines and shooting of young Kodi both shocking and unconstitutional. The jury unanimously rejected the officer’s qualified immunity defense and awarded Kodi nearly $33 million in damages — perhaps the largest police misconduct verdict in Baltimore County history. In the years since the jury’s emphatic verdict, however, the trial judge overseeing the case — himself a former police officer — has second-guessed and undermined the jury through a series of legal rulings, most recently resurrecting qualified immunity to insulate police from liability and override Kodi’s rights. Worse still, earlier this year a panel of Maryland’s intermediate appellate court agreed, contending that qualified immunity protects police from liability and deprives Kodi of any remedy for the harms he suffered, because Kodi was merely an innocent bystander. Shockingly, Kodi’s case is not unique. There have been multiple shootings of innocent bystanders by mistake by police officers in Central Maryland and beyond. In fact, Baltimore County police officers have even shot their own fellow officers on multiple occasions, including a 2020 incident nearly killing an officer through so-called “friendly” fire. This is what Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has called qualified immunity’s “shoot first, think later” approach to policing. The notion that police should be immunized from liability for shooting a child like Kodi is sickening, as if his young life is mere collateral damage from their lawless violence against his mother. In its verdict finding that police bear liability for their unconstitutional shootings of Korryn and Kodi Gaines, the jury plainly sought to demand — as did the Fourth Circuit in the Jones case — that police must exercise their enormous power with at least basic “respect for the dignity and worth of Black lives.” For Maryland courts to say otherwise using the made-up doctrine of qualified immunity is unacceptable, and further entrenches the “shoot first, think later” approach that has perpetuated avoidable civilian injuries and deaths nationwide, despite overwhelming public outrage. If we have any hope of stemming the tide of police violence against Black people here in Maryland and across America, this has to stop. Deborah Jeon (jeon@aclu-md.org) is legal director for the ACLU of Maryland, which collaborated to submit a friend-of-the-court brief in the Maryland Supreme Court challenging egregious application of qualified immunity to protect police from consequences of their violence at the expense of an innocent Black child."

Police were called to the house on Jan. 6, 2022, on a report that Ryan had shot himself in the hand. It was later revealed by police that the hand injury was caused by a less-than-lethal projectile shot by police after Ryan pointed a handgun at officers. They say the projectile was found during surgery.  Ryan also was injured when he fired his gun before police arrived. He apparently suffered a cut to the forehead after a bullet hit a bathroom sink and sent a splinter of porcelain flying.  Police reports say Ryan had consumed a half bottle of tequila by the time officers arrived at his property.

Subscribe to have The Washington Times’ Higher Ground delivered to your inbox every Sunday.  Yet while these political games dominate news headlines, send the stock market into a nosedive, and put federal employees at risk of having to work without pay, nothing about these high-handed theatrics will diminish the immediate and very real dangers of the American Police State with its roadside strip searches, government surveillance, biometric databases, citizens being treated like terrorists, imprisonments for criticizing the government, national ID cards, SWAT team raids, censorship, forcible blood draws and DNA extractions, private prisons, weaponized drones, red light cameras, tasers, active shooter drills, police misconduct and government corruption.  Default or not, surveillance will continue. Censorship and persecution of anyone who criticizes the government will continue. The government’s efforts to label dissidents as extremists and terrorists will continue.  Police shootings will continue. Highway robbery meted out by government officials will continue. Corrupt government will continue. Profit-driven prisons will continue. The militarization of the police will continue. And wars abroad as well as the government’s ongoing war on the American people will continue.  Indeed, take a look at the programs and policies that will not be affected by a government default on its debt leading to a possible shutdown, and you’ll get a clearer sense of the government’s priorities, which have little to do with serving taxpayers and everything to do with amassing money, power and control.  Surveillance will continue unabated. On any given day, whether you’re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders.  The targeting of religious individuals will continue unabated. If you attend a church or subscribe to religious beliefs that are at odds with the mainstream, politically correct views, for ex., about abortion or homosexuality, you could be flagged as a threat. Indeed, the government is handing out $20 million in grants to police, mental health networks, universities, churches and school districts to enlist their help in identifying Americans who might be political dissidents or potential “extremists.” That includes planting spies in houses of worship as part of its so-called effort to combat domestic terrorism.  The undermining of the Constitution will continue unabated. America’s so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, has chipped away at our freedoms, unraveled our Constitution and transformed our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws — which completely circumvent the rule of law and the constitutional rights of American citizens, re-orienting our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the rule of law, our U.S. Constitution, becomes the map by which we navigate life in the United States — will continue to be enforced.  Militarized policing will continue unabated. Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, America’s law enforcement officials will continue to treat the American people like suspects rather than citizens.  The shadow government— a.k.a. the Deep State, a.k.a. the police state, a.k.a. the military industrial complex, a.k.a. the surveillance state complex—will continue unabated. This corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials will continue to call the shots in Washington DC, no matter who sits in the White House or controls Congress. By “government,” I’m not referring to the highly partisan, two-party bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. Rather, I’m referring to “government” with a capital “G,” the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law.  These issues are not going away.  Whether or not the government runs out of borrowed money, it will remain business as usual in terms of the police state’s unceasing pursuit of power and control at the expense of the citizenry.  –  Constitutional attorney and author John W.

Richmond police Sgt. Donald Patchin said the man died at a hospital over the weekend. He had been rushed there after the Nov. 9 shooting on the parkway between Goodrick Avenue and Giant Highway. Authorities early Tuesday identified him as Arcjoseph Rodillo, 26, of San Pablo. Police did not announce any arrests, nor did they say what they think the motive may have been. They also did not provide a description of the vehicle the suspect was driving. The homicide is the seventh one investigated by Richmond police this year. That number does not include the June death of a person fatally shot by police as they served a warrant. A gunshot-detection alert and several emergency calls brought the shooting to police attention, Patchin said. He added that witnesses told officers that a driver in another vehicle was pursuing the victim and that somebody was shooting. The gunfire hit Rodillo at least once, Patchin said. The vehicle then crashed into the center median."

The District Attorney’s Office reported Monday it had reviewed four recent shootings by law enforcement officers and two in-custody deaths and found the officers’ actions in each case were legally justified.  The incidents occurred in 2021 and 2022 and resulted in the deaths of five men and serious injuries to one. The district attorney’s report found that the shootings or deaths happened during investigations by officers from four local agencies: the San Diego, Harbor, Chula Vista and National City police departments.  In two of the shootings, people pointed guns or shot at the officers who then opened fire, officials said. The two other shootings occurred after the suspects approached officers armed with a knife or machete and ignored commands to drop their weapons, according to the review.  Advertisement  The two men who died in police custody either overdosed and were experiencing a medical emergency, the findings showed.  The district attorney said the officers will not be charged criminally.  Here, in chronological order, are the six incidents as described by police and the District Attorney’s Office:  Brian Umana, 28, was fatally shot Oct. 8, 2021, after National City Police Department officers received a report that a man armed with a sword was trying to break into a self-storage facility.  When two officers arrived on the scene , they located Umana standing on the 33rd Street sidewalk, just west of National City Boulevard. He was holding a machete at his side.  The officers commanded Umana to drop the machete, but he refused. The officers closed in on the man to use a Taser, getting within 15 feet of him.  The Taser was ineffective, and the man stepped toward the officers with the machete raised over his head, according to the investigation. The officers fired a handgun and rifle, striking Umana.  A toxicology report said Umana had methamphetamine and amphetamine in his system.  Eric Jesus Medina, 29, was wounded during a gunfight with officers in front of the San Diego Harbor Police Department on April 10, 2022.  Medina drove to the headquarters on North Harbor Drive and used a call box out front to ask a police dispatcher inside for help. When an officer walked out to help the man, Medina pointed a semi-automatic handgun at the officer, authorities said.  Believing Medina was going to shoot him, the officer fired his weapon at Medina, according to the district attorney’s findings. Two other officers quickly responded and opened fire on the gunman.  Medina was shot and eventually surrendered. He was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center with critical injuries.  Earlier this year, Medina was sentenced to nine years in state prison.  Denny Jalate, 23, died soon after San Diego police officers detained him on Oct. 9, 2022, at a home on 39th Street south of Thorn Street in City Heights.  The man’s family had called 911 after he threatened to kill his stepfather and had thrown bricks through a sliding door and car window at the house. When officers arrived at the house, they found Jalate was being restrained on the ground by his parents, according to the district attorney’s review.  Jalate had a weak pulse and was unresponsive, even as he was put into handcuffs, authorities said. Officers began to perform CPR and administered Narcan — a nasal spray used to reverse the symptoms of an opioid overdose.  Paramedics took Jalate to Scripps Mercy Hospital where he died. The Medical Examiner’s Office listed alcohol poisoning, cardiovascular disease and obesity as “significant contributing factors” in his death.  The district attorney found that officers had properly treated Jalate while he was in medical distress and awaiting an ambulance.  Derrick Weatherspoon, 33, was shot and killed by San Diego police after he opened fire on officers outside of a Southcrest taco shop on Oct. 18, 2022.  On the night of the shooting, two officers responded to a report of a man with a gun at Humberto’s Taco Shop on South 43rd Street. As the officers arrived, Weatherspoon ran out of the restaurant and began firing at them, the investigation found.  The two officers got out of their patrol car and returned fire. Weatherspoon was shot multiple times, but he continued to fire at the officers.  Weatherspoon ran past the patrol car before he fell to the ground with the gun still in his hand. He died before he could be taken to a hospital.  The gunman later tested positive for alcohol, amphetamine, methamphetamine and cocaine.  Daniel Armenta, 35, died less than 30 minutes after police found him overdosing on methamphetamine and crawling on the street in City Heights.  On Dec. 8, 2022, witnesses reported seeing Armenta acting erratically and walking in the middle of El Cajon Boulevard, near 43rd Street, forcing vehicles in the area to swerve to avoid hitting him.  By the time officers arrived, Armenta had fallen to the ground in front of a gas station and was mumbling to himself. Officers called paramedics and supported the man as he got to his feet to walk over to a patrol car, according to investigators.  He collapsed before reaching the vehicle and became unresponsive. The officers administered two rounds of Narcan and performed CPR, but Armenta did not regain consciousness.  He died before he could be taken to a hospital.  Bradley Munroe, 32, was shot and killed after walking toward a Chula Vista police dog handler while holding a knife in a parking lot on Dec. 18, 2022.  On the night of the shooting , multiple callers reported a woman screaming for help and a man hitting her at a shopping center on Broadway near Oxford Street. According to the woman, who was later identified as Munroe’s mother, her son was mentally ill and trying to save her from her car, which he thought was going to explode.  When the officer arrived on the scene, he noticed Munroe was carrying a knife. Munroe refused to follow multiple commands from the officer to drop the knife and get on the ground. He began to approach the officer with the knife still in his hand.  After Munroe continued to ignore the officer’s orders and after a few more steps forward, the officer shot him, the investigation found.  Munroe died before he could be taken to a hospital, police said.  A toxicology report showed a number of drugs in his system at the time of the shooting, including amphetamine, meth, ephedrine, PCP and fentanyl."

Police subsequently began investigating 17-year-old Nicholas Bruington, of Bismarck, as the prime suspect, according to Lt. Luke Gardiner. About 1:50 a.m., officers stopped a vehicle in which Bruington was a passenger, near the Scheels sporting goods store in the Kirkwood Mall parking lot.

The NYPD is using drones 3 times more than it did last year,2023-11-13,2023-11-14T16:32:59Z,en,gothamist.com,https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114163259id_/https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year,https://web.archive.org/web/20231114163259/https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGdvdGhhbWlzdCkvbmV3cy90aGUtbnlwZC1pcy11c2luZy1kcm9uZXMtMy10aW1lcy1tb3JlLXRoYW4taXQtZGlkLWxhc3QteWVhcg~~,"The NYPD has more than tripled its use of drones in the last year, most recently deploying them 13 different times to monitor public protests last month, according to police data. Between April and June of this year, the department deployed drones 143 times. Before that, it had never deployed drones more than 50 times in a three-month period, the data shows. Police handed over drone footage from protests in Times Square and in Bay Ridge last month to prosecutors to use as evidence in criminal charges against 158 people, officials said. The NYPDâs drone fleet has doubled in size since the program was launched five years ago â from 13 drones then to 30 today, and will continue to expand in the coming years. New Yorkers attending large-scale events and celebrations are now likely to spot drones hovering overhead. They are being used to scan for sharks off summer beaches, make rescues during storms and capture the scenes of police shootings, police said. Prosecutors have historically used NYPD drone footage during the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement and as evidence in other cases like robberies, according to Oren Yaniv, a spokesperson for the Brooklyn district attorney. NYPD Assistant Commissioner Kaz Daughtry, who oversees the departmentâs new technology, says he hopes one day they will be saving lives by dropping flotation devices to struggling swimmers, and delivering the overdose prevention drug Narcan to people in drug-induced medical distress. Daughtry even said he is researching having drones respond to some crime reports. But as the NYPD looks to use drones in new ways, some civil liberties activists say they see it as an undemocratic violation of privacy. They, along with a tech policy expert interviewed by Gothamist, point out that no agency outside the NYPD oversees or regulates how the department uses information gathered by drones. âThis is a local police department that increasingly acts like a national intelligence agency,â said Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. âThe idea that you can have a drone hovering over a protest, collecting the identities of every person there, without any oversight, without any protections? That's unbelievably chilling.â In an exclusive drone demonstration for Gothamist, NYPD Detective Matthew Andrews-Sales, the NYPDâs head drone pilot, explained that the NYPDâs drone cameras can zoom in on people and objects up to 200x from the air, showing peopleâs faces clearly. But Daughtry said that function is reserved for New Yorkers committing crimes or infractions. The NYPD has long maintained that its drones arenât equipped with facial recognition software â technology that has led people to be falsely accused of crimes elsewhere. But police can run drone footage through facial recognition software back at police headquarters. Department officials said that a police detective manually reviews every facial match before police move to make an arrest. The NYPD deletes drone footage after 30 days unless it's being used to investigate an alleged crime like the Bay Ridge protest, and that the drones it currently uses cannot record audio, Daughtry said. Some tech policy experts consider drones to be among the least invasive policing strategies â as long as police arenât using them to mass identify every person at a protest. â[Drones] donât really give anything other than a different vantage point,â said Adam Scott Wandt, vice chair for technology of the Department of Public Management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. âThe police have cameras on poles and on top of cars everywhere anyway.â âYou should be expecting the government to be taking pictures of you from every angle.â How the program works The NYPDâs Technical Assistance Response Unit, which is headquartered at an old army base in Queens, already uses drones for a range of purposes. Officers used drones this summer to measure crowd size at JâOuvert and the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn and the Electric Zoo festival on Randallâs Island, Daughtry said. In September, police said they used a drone to help rescue someone trapped inside their car as heavy rains flooded the cityâs roadways. The drone footage was streamed to police headquarters, and officers deployed police and firefighters to help the driver exit safely. The NYPD also uses drones to capture scenes of police shootings, Daughtry said. They capture 360-degree visuals of buildings and streets, and the department pairs it with officer body-worn camera footage and then shows it to the commissioner for review. A live feed from the drones is screened at the police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, where dozens of officers monitor video from tens of thousands of police cameras across the five boroughs. Law enforcement officials in the field can also view the live drone feeds from their cellphones or iPads, Daughtry said. Mayor Eric Adams has championed police drones in part because he says they save the city money. While flying an NYPD helicopter costs up to $2,200 per flight, he said launching a drone costs just 17 cents. Some drones tethered to police cars can run on vehicle gasoline, Daughtry said. Program has been veiled in secrecy The NYPD has been tight-lipped about its use of drones, saying that revealing too much about the technology and when it is deployed could compromise police investigations. Officials have refused to share information on surveillance and technology products it has purchased, keeping contracts âofflineâ and out of the public eye. A state Supreme Court justice last month granted a request from the Legal Aid Society to access historically opaque NYPD âspecial expenseâ budget contracts for various electronic surveillance technologies â which could reveal more about policing technology and how it is used. Federal drone law says that âno person may operate a small unmanned aircraft over a human being.â But the NYPD has an exemption waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration through August 2025 that allows it to fly drones in populated areas, at night, over 400 feet in the air, among other things. The NYPD is also required to get special FAA authorization to fly its drones in certain cases, according to FAA spokesperson Arlene Salac. When asked for specific information about how often the NYPD flies its drones and for what purpose, Salac declined to say and asked Gothamist to submit a Freedom of Information Act request. NYC drones fleet continues to expand The NYPD paid $87,750 in June for a Lemur 2 drone manufactured by Seattle-based drone company BRINC, according to city records. Lemur 2 drones have night vision and thermal sensors. They can break glass to enter buildings and recreate floor plans with 360-degree views, which police say can be used for situations like the April parking garage collapse. The drones can even facilitate two-way audio conversations between officers and anyone inside a building. BRINC Founder and CEO Blake Resnick said the NYPD has not yet received its Lemur 2 drone. Adams has been a loud proponent of drones since his days as Brooklyn Borough President when he pushed for a bill in 2019 that would allow drones to conduct building inspections. As mayor last fall, he met with the founders of two Israeli drone companies who said their autonomous drones are used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to patrol the Mexican border, as well as by the Israel Defense Forces at the border of Gaza, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. The city has not yet entered into a deal with either of these companies, according to the mayorâs spokesperson Charles Lutvak. Adams and Daughtry also reviewed new drone technology in Israel while visiting the countryâs National Police Academy in August. The NYPD has a long history of training with Israeli law enforcement, according to Detective Charlie Ben-Naim, a department liaison stationed in Tel Aviv. Israel is at the forefront of using drones as first responders, Daughtry said, and serves as inspiration for his plans to increase the NYPDâs drone fleet. âWe're not looking for grandma's secret recipe sauce that she's putting on a grill. We're not looking to see if you're making hamburgers or hot dogs. We're out there using drones to fight crime,â Daughtry said."

Baltimore police shooting prompts criticism of specialized gun squads,2023-11-11,2023-11-12T02:09:28Z,en,afro.com,https://afro.com/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-specialized-gun-squads/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231112020928id_/https://afro.com/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-specialized-gun-squads/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231112020928/https://afro.com/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-specialized-gun-squads/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGFmcm8pL2JhbHRpbW9yZS1wb2xpY2Utc2hvb3RpbmctcHJvbXB0cy1jcml0aWNpc20tb2Ytc3BlY2lhbGl6ZWQtZ3VuLXNxdWFkcw~~,"By Lea Skene, The Associated Press BALTIMORE (AP) — After a corruption scandal led the Baltimore Police Department to disband its plainclothes gun squad in 2017, the embattled agency pledged to increase oversight while remaining focused on seizing illegal weapons and curbing rampant violence. But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the department’s latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today. Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Nov. 7, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life. They said the deadly police shooting has drawn attention to an issue they have been complaining about for years: that certain officers are known in the majority-Black community for harassing residents and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters. “They’re always jumping out on us for no reason. It happens all the time,” said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. “Now, we see the consequences.” McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots. Officials said officers on a District Action Team — squads focused on seizing illegal guns — were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the city’s most violent neighborhoods. In the immediate aftermath of the Nov. 7 shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officers’ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon. “This is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,” Worley said at the scene Nov. 7. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months. Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the city’s Black community. After Freddie Gray’s 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms. Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly-released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders. Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach. “The focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,” he said. “Communities don’t want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.” A study published by Webster’s team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but there’s “a ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrust” — partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence. Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimore’s low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era. “The name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,” researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers “focus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.” She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the department’s internal discipline process. “Due to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,” Eldridge said. “These teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.” Less than six months before the latest shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying “characteristics of an armed person.” The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them. “They look at everybody as suspects unless you’re old or a certain color,” Rashawn McNeil said. “It’s dehumanizing. That’s what it is.”"
"‘Malcolm X,’ the Met Opera revival, returns to New York.

The Met Opera work, which opened last week at Lincoln Center, traces the life of the Black civil rights leader, from his childhood in Michigan to his final moments, when he was gunned down at age 39 in Audubon Ballroom, Washington Heights. Opening night was a glamorous affair, drawing notable Black figures including actress Lupita Nyong’o, scholar and philosopher Cornel West and the Rev. Al Sharpton. The spaceship serves as a futuristic twist on Marcus Garvey’s Black Star Line, which in the early 20th century transported African Americans by ship to Africa. But the list of names running along the side of the spaceship indicates that we’re in a new, modernized version of the opera, one that has been updated from the 1986 production. The references span 120 years of history. In addition to Black lynching victims like Fred Rochelle (1901) and Emmett Till (1955) and victims of police shootings such as 12-year-old Tamir Rice (2014), it includes Asian Americans and South Asian Americans who have been on the receiving end of racial hatred: Vincent Chin (1982), Balbir Singh Sodhi (2001) and Xiaojie Tan, who in 2021 was gunned down while working at Young’s Asian Massage outside of Atlanta. Civil rights is not just about Black people, it's about civil rights and human rights for everybody. Malcolm X was a human rights activist in the end. The choice to be racially inclusive was made by director Robert O’Hara, the Tony-nominated director of “Slave Play,” who said in an interview that it spoke to the life’s work of Malcolm X. “Civil rights is not just about Black people, it's about civil rights and human rights for everybody,” said O’Hara. “Malcolm X was a human rights activist in the end.” In life and well after his death, Malcolm X was a political lightning rod, but on stage he is presented as a meditative figure, one who was shaped by his years in prison and spiritually renewed by a late-in-life pilgrimage to Mecca. For some opera lovers the production of “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X,” which runs through Dec. 2, represents a cultural milestone. “The Met officially brands it worthy of the status of great American opera,” said playwright and director Tazewell Thompson. “It has entered the repertoire.” ‘Seared in my memory’ The opera made its world premiere in 1986, at New York City Opera. Thompson, a longtime playwright and theater director whose work often deals with the Black experience, said his recollection of the original production remains vivid. He distinctly recalled traveling from his apartment in Harlem “in an inside and out graffiti-covered subway” to Lincoln Center. “Seared in my memory,” said Thompson. He sat waiting with nervous anticipation in the “dead center” of the orchestra section. “When the curtain rose it seemed I held my breath until the final curtain was brought in.” The opera more than lived up to its expectations, he said in an email, by creating “an absorbing, enthralling spectacle,” one that was wide-ranging in its musical offerings: “vibrant, searing arias; an abundant fund of sensuous melody; stretches of seductive, repetitive choral chants; Wagner inspired harmonies; dazzling jazz.” Opera critic Fred Plotkin said the power of the original production held through in the current avatar, which he experienced Tuesday night, more than 37 years after first encountering “X.” “The score is magnificent,” said Plotkin, author of “Opera 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Opera,” who said he heard influences of Charles Mingus, Fats Waller and his “beloved” Duke Ellington. “What the music evokes, however, which is so wonderful about this music – it is original music. It's not derivative,” said Plotkin. “He's quoting, he's referring, but he's taking that music and going elsewhere with it,” he said of Anthony Davis. Black performers in a white space Naomi André, a musicologist and author of “Black Opera: History, Power, Engagement,” said the fact that “X” opened at the Met, “one of the most important opera stages in the world,” is that much more significant when viewed against the history of the form. “Opera for so long has been this predominantly, almost exclusively, all white space that's a very elitist space,” said André, who is the David G. Frey Distinguished Professor in the music department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Notable exceptions were Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, who was born into slavery in the early 1800s but eventually received voice lessons and became an internationally renowned opera performer. “She ended up singing for Queen Victoria in the 1850s,” said André. “Yeah, craziness.” André said for many aficionados the “breaking of the color barrier” in opera took place in 1955 when Marian Anderson made her debut at the Met, becoming the first African American to sing a leading role with the company. In subsequent years, other Black performers also made a name for themselves: Leontyne Price, George Shirley, Grace Bumbry. By and large, however, Black women had an easier time breaking through than Black men, said André. Once again, she argued, racism was at work. “There was still a real fear of miscegenation on the opera stage,” she said. “So it was easier to see Black women with white heroes than Black men with white heroines.” In recent decades, other problems have persisted in opera, said André, including the use of blackface and yellowface in “Otello,” “Turandot,” “Madama Butterfly” and “Aida,” among others. But André said the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted after the killing of George Floyd in 2020 forced opera to look inward. “Finally opera companies began to say, ‘Whoa, we have been incredibly exclusive.’ I mean, anybody could have told you that, but they finally noticed it.” In 2021, the Met presented “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” by Terence Blanchard, the first time the company had staged an opera by a Black composer in its 138-year history. Not long after, the Met signed on to “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X.” Very much supported by the Met O’Hara, the director, said the Met wasn’t in the picture when talks began – it was initially a joint venture between opera companies in Detroit, Seattle and Omaha. But once it signed on, he said the institution was fully supportive. “Peter Gelb, the general manager, he always had my back,” said O’Hara. Still, he said, he told the company early on that it would have to “earn the right for us to be telling this story here,” and “acknowledge that you have not had us here before. That you have not told these stories.” O’Hara said these demands emerged in part from the strain the material placed on the creative team, including “the actors who have to basically kill a Black man every night in front of your audience.” As a public service, he proposed that the Met hold a marathon reading of the entire “Autobiography of Malcolm X, as Told to Alex Haley,” which ultimately took place on Oct. 29 and was free to the public. Readers included actor Courtney Vance, Dr. Ilyasah Shabazz (daughter of Malcolm X) and Bill Haley, the grandson of Alex Haley. The reading took place over 18 hours. The book, said O’Hara, is “very uncomfortable” at times. “You don't have the right to put an X in front of your building and expect comfort,” said O’Hara. “Malcolm X didn't provide comfort. He provided the truth.” And although Malcolm X was assassinated, O’Hara said he’s “not really dead,” because we continue to talk about him. Occasionally, he said, people raise the question: What would Malcolm X have thought of the fact that his revolutionary life was now being told in this extremely white, extremely rarefied arena – albeit one with a floating spaceship? “He would probably be rolling around in his grave going, ‘What the hell is going on? Why is my story being told there?’” said O’Hara. “So hopefully we have done a service to him.”"

Morrison’s short had its world premiere seven months ago, at Visions du Réel, in Nyon, Switzerland, the first of 10 European venues — including the new Unarchive Found Footage Festival, in Rome, where it won for Best Short — before tentatively entering the Americas by way of Cinemancia, in Medellín, Colombia, only landing in the United States in September, at Telluride.  That Morrison’s most overtly relevant work to contemporary U.S. society launched at rarefied festivals outside the United States is as comprehensible as it is anomalous. Incident is a rough-looking film about a rough topic. Composed of publicly accessed digital surveillance footage, the 30-minute video documents, virtually in real time, a white cop’s contentious killing of a Black man five years ago in Chicago.  It’s also a very personal film. Set on Chicago’s South Side, near where Morrison was born and raised, it premiered there in a screening and community conversation attended by the victim’s mother — notably, only 10 days before its New York premiere in the East Village, where the artist has lived and worked since he arrived here to study at Cooper Union almost 40 years ago.  Bringing Incident home, to New York as well as Chicago, seems to have been fraught. Yet it’s not only the forensic subject of the work — recently named to the International Documentary Association’s short list of best shorts of 2023 — but its digital sources and form that seem, at first look, to signal a significant departure from the artist’s noted oeuvre.  Morrison has been making new films from bits of old ones for the better part of three decades. His works are new not simply because they interpolate in the present footage produced in the past. They’re new because they expand the contemporary practice of documentary art, by projecting moving-image history not as nostalgic preservation but as dynamic conversation between movies made and viewed by bygone others and those Morrison makes from them today.  Morrison’s best-known films feature visually noisy silent-age footage that he mines in archives. Manically unstable nitrate stock generates the optic static that erupts as abstract phantasms gamboling into frames inhabited by unsuspecting co-stars from yesteryears. The title of Morrison’s singularly iconic work, Decasia (2002), adumbrates the chameleonic decay that brands his entire oeuvre. Named in 2013 to the National Film Registry of movies deemed intrinsic to the heritage of the United States, it is preserved in the Library of Congress, itself a repository of oodles of reels that have contributed to multiple Morrison projects, including Decasia.  Still from 2002’s “Decasia.” Icarus Films  An audiovisual symphony that elides narrative exposition, Decasia nonetheless dives deeply into history, not to explain events but to evoke time across temporalities: the known time of the footage’s production, the unknown time of its material transformation, and, finally, the time of Morrison’s creation. Those historical poetics have remained in place even as his most recent long-form films — notably, Dawson City: Frozen Time (2016) and The Village Detective: A Song Cycle (2021) — have become increasingly expository by narratively addressing film history itself, as well as weaving stories about individuals on the screen and around it in ways that rehearse Incident’s dedication to relating its story.  I first learned of Incident when I joined Morrison across the street from Cooper Union, at McSorley’s Old Ale House, on a cold November evening a year ago. A couple of months earlier, I had published an essay about The Village Detective, a meditation about Morrison’s own archival practice expressed through its contemplation of the long career of Soviet movie star Mikhail Zharov. Triggered by an Icelandic lobster trawler’s incidental dredging of a partial print of the Russian actor’s most popular movie (Morrison’s titular source), a widely available 1969 sound film, and decayed by the ocean (not long-obsolete nitrate stock), The Village Detective now feels like an incidental transition to Incident’s abandonment of esoteric cinematic sources altogether. In any case, as Morrison and I discussed my take on his last feature, he mentioned his new short and subsequently provided me access to the work-in-progress.  I found Incident startling on its own, but also for how it magnified Morrison’s practice. As I viewed its evolving iterations, I recognized that its evident divergences from Morrison’s prior works — notably, its absence of both old cinema and new music as well as its direct focus on a recent real-life event — only distilled his constant commitment to social relevance, exploring the ambiguity of visual evidence, and visualizing time as contextual, not absolute. Even before I attended a screening of an almost-final cut last December, I knew that I wanted to discuss Incident with Morrison.  Incident’s narrative and visual form is its politics; there’s no mystery, no emotional redemption, no legal compensation, just lethal reality: a shot of straight hooch cut with a jigger of ambiguity.  In May, as Incident hopped around Europe, Morrison and I met again at McSorley’s, just around the corner from this paper’s former long-time headquarters on Cooper Square, where Morrison told me that, back in the day, he “would pick it up on Wednesday nights from the office and get a jump on stuff.” The same waiter who greeted Morrison with easy familiarity when we met last fall did so again this past spring. “Rich and I are about the same age and he was working here when I was coming here for burgers on my lunch break” (from Cooper Union, back in the late ’80s), Morrison told me. The filmmaker is a McSorley’s steady, the locution Joseph Mitchell recorded in his indelible New Yorker profile of the Old Ale House, in 1940, at what is now about the halfway point in its history.  i was sitting in mcsorley’s. outside it was New  York and beautifully snowing. — e.e. cummings (1925)  Morrison is part of a tradition. A pantheon’s worth of Gotham artists has been drawn to McSorley’s. Some, like Mitchell, markedly documented their connection. John Sloan painted the haunt realistically a dozen years before E.E. Cummings wrote about it cubistically. Berenice Abbott — who, like all women (before the National Organization for Women successfully sued the establishment for discrimination, in 1970), could not drink there — nevertheless lobbied successfully to document the joint’s interior, in 1947. Her photographs are visual evidence that what Mitchell reported a few years earlier, about the saloon’s first 86 years — that all of its owners “have been opposed to change” — remains relevant 83 years later.  Morrison is a ""steady"" at McSorley's. SETH FEIN  Indeed, the tavern’s artifact-plastered walls exhibit dedicated preservation. The bar is an inhabited archive. But material conservation can provoke artistic innovation. As Cummings’s line suggests, the dissonance between McSorley’s atavistic interior and the contemporary world through its windows could be supremely generative. Old things inspiring new creations is, after all, the essence of documentary art. Maybe that, as well as the burgers and ale, and his longtime connection with Rich, continues to draw Morrison there.  Much like his nitrate sources, Morrison’s practice has changed across time, movement that Incident punctuates. It jettisons the romance of the archive. The texture of its surveillance footage does not beguile. It’s not degraded; it’s simply low-grade. But Incident’s form as well as its content enthralls. Morrison’s split-screen editing divides time spatially, synchronically juxtaposing different views of the roughly half-hour that surrounds the killing of Harith “Snoop” Augustus, a 37-year-old father of a then-five-year-old daughter, who was walking near where he cut hair, at the Sideline Studio. The footage does not speak for itself. The artist is present and necessary — a lesson relevant for our fragmented media age, saturated with audiovisual evidence but starved for discerningly creative interpretation.  Producing history across media, in print or video, is an act of informed revision. Incident re-visions two iterations of the footage from which it draws: the truncated video that the Chicago police department claimed cleared Dillan Halley — the probationary police officer who killed Augustus on July 14, 2018 — by showing that the shooting was a reasonable “split-second” defensive decision, and Six Durations of a Split Second: The Death of Harith Augustus, the public video installation — produced in 2019 by Chicago’s Invisible Institute (a co-producer of Incident) and deploying analytic animations rendered by Forensic Architecture — which critically challenged not only the official judgment’s exculpatory conclusions but also the temporal terms of its analysis: the assertion that the cause of Augustus’s death could be reduced to a split second.  “Police shot! Shots fired at the police.” These most unquestionably untrue words, radioed by the cops reporting the “incident” (police parlance for a police shooting), reveal Incident’s most undeniable truths: official disregard for the truth and for the victim, as cops self-protectively, counterfactually, reflexively closed ranks at the scene (as well as in their postmortem investigation). Halley insisted immediately, “He pulled a gun on us!,” an invention that his partner, Megan Fleming, fervently confirmed. (Halley, the shooter, received only a two-day suspension for not turning on his body cam in a “timely manner,” one of the five violations also cited in Fleming’s 60-day suspension, which, Incident reports, included both “stopping a suspect” and “making physical contact without justification.”)  Hypnotic Pictures and Invisible Institute  Augustus’s intentions after the police physically accost him may remain subject to individual and institutional interpretation, or, more likely, predisposition. But the cops’ intentions are evident after Halley kills Augustus. Accordingly, Incident could be meaningfully retitled, Incidental. This works not only because much of the video’s multicam footage was recorded incidentally but also because of how incidental, how bone-chillingly inconsequential, Augustus’s life appears to be to the police cavalierly conversing, indifferent to the victim’s body lying a few feet from their feet, as bystanders resolutely condemn the shooting of their neighbor as a mortal misdeed.  Hypnotic Pictures and Invisible Institute  Although most Morrison works reassemble silent footage, they are anything but silent. Music is vital to his practice. He has closely collaborated with composers on his films — including Michael Gordon (Decasia, 2002), Jóhann Jóhannsson (The Miners’ Hymns, 2010), Bill Frisell (The Great Flood, 2012), Alex Somers (Dawson City: Frozen Time, 2016), David Lang (The Village Detective, 2021). He’s also produced numerous projections for such iconic iconoclasts as Steve Reich (Different Trains, 2016) and John Adams (The Death of Klinghoffer, 2003; Nixon in China, 2017; and Antony and Cleopatra, 2022/2023).  Morrison also follows the blues. And if ever there were a story that resonates with the blues, it’s Harith Augustus’s stunningly sudden demise on an early-summer late afternoon on Chicago’s South Side: senselessly shot by a panicky cop, stumbling into the gutter, gunned down, down the street from where he barbered. Yet, unlike most Morrison movies, Incident has no music but does have lots of found sound and silence. Body-cam-recorded audio and police-radio transmissions prevail, sonic evidence rigorously synced to action; when corresponding sound for closed-circuit footage is absent, the scene is deathly silent.  In our conversation, Morrison cited Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon (1950), which dramatizes four divergent testimonies of one murder, as Incident’s inspiration, initially as a narrative work. Indeed, aspects of the actual documentary, especially the acting by the police, rival narrative cinema. Too, Incident achieves the realist effects that narrative films have attempted, most obviously Mike Figgis’s Timecode (2000), which simultaneously projects four 90-minute interlaced docufictions (each shot in one surveillance-like take) on a quadrated split-screen. But it is Incident’s sonic scheme — even more than its visual form — that indexes its approach to history as well as its place in film history.  The 30-second buffer, where you can see video from 30 seconds before but not [hear the] audio, is to protect the police from something stupid they might have said 30 seconds before that could have exacerbated or escalated things.  Incident’s sound design projects a sharply connective contrast with the monumentally significant, genre-defying, true-crime film of the past century, one also dedicated to forensic analysis of official injustice. Errol Morris’s The Thin Blue Line (1988) — which, like Decasia (a movie Morris has fulsomely praised), is on the National Film Registry — was the first of Morris’s three movies (so far) scored by Philip Glass, with whom Morrison has also collaborated. But Incident is an audiovisual counterpoint to The Thin Blue Line’s aestheticization of history, as it is to Morrison’s own prominently scored films. Where Morrison’s short starkly juxtaposes non-professionally shot archived footage that shockingly observes a cop’s specious curbside shooting of Augustus, sans composed sound, Morris’s feature stylishly stages minimalist mises-en-scène — as burnished as Glass’s minimalist harmonics — that create haunting cinematic evidence of a criminal’s roadside killing of a cop in a predigital, pre-dash-cam age.  The films’ formal differences exhibit, however, a shared commitment to self-reflexive re-creation of specific moving-image regimes, as well as (unjustly adjudicated) deadly shootings. The Thin Blue Line untangles as a serpentine Hollywood noir, a mystery climatically solved by a truth revealed. Along its way, Morris interviews a menagerie of B-filmish, real-life characters playing themselves in scenes that are as hauntingly staged as his film’s dream-like dramatizations. Contrastingly, Incident’s look resembles a multicam security monitor, anywhere today. Its narrative and visual form is its politics; there’s no mystery, no emotional redemption, no legal compensation, just lethal reality: a shot of straight hooch cut with a jigger of ambiguity.  Incident ends where it begins: Harith Augustus shot dead. Its story is less an arc than an ellipse, a deformed circle. There is no progress, only the antiheroic actuality of American Exceptionalism, writ small. It’s a craggy blues story, minus the melody. As Morrison told me at McSorley’s, “It’s a bummer of a film. And some of my films, as difficult and challenging as they can be, the people who like them are uplifted by them. And this, I think, nobody leaves this film happy.”  …  (The interview below has been edited for clarity and concision from a face-to-face conversation with Morrison in May 2023 and an email follow-up in October. SF)  SETH FEIN: How did Incident happen?  BILL MORRISON: There’s a journalist out of Chicago, Jamie Kalven [credited as Incident’s co-producer]. He runs something called the Invisible Institute. He originally filed the lawsuit Kalven v. City of Chicago to make all police recordings public record, and then broke the Laquan McDonald case by suing for the dashboard cam, which made all Chicago police records public access and required that they be released within 60 days, which is sort of the premise that this film sets up: That’s new for the cops and they’re all sort of performing now. They know that they’re on camera and that’s going to be reviewed.  [Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke killed 17-year-old McDonald in October 2014. Van Dyke’s claim of self-defense unraveled with the release of dash-cam footage that showed he fired 16 times at McDonald, who was retreating. Van Dyke’s upcoming September trial hovered over Chicago, Incident explains, on the day Halley shot Augustus. Convicted of second-degree murder, Van Dyke had served only 39 of his 81-month prison sentence when released, in February 2022.]  Jamie wrote about the Augustus case extensively in The Intercept. … and he’s an old family friend. I’ve known him since I was a kid. And we’d meet on the street sometimes [in Chicago, where Kalven lives near Morrison’s mother], either he was walking his dog or he was running and we would talk. And one thing we were talking about, as he got more and more into surveillance, was this idea of a modern-day Rashomon written as a narrative, not a doc, in which each retelling of a crime would be from a different camera — an iPhone, a surveillance camera, a dashboard camera, closed-circuit TV, a body cam — they would all tell a different truth. And that was a really compelling idea. And I still think it’s a compelling idea. But as he continued to write about this piece and then did sort of an epilogue last summer [2022] kind of wrapping it up, about what happened, none of these cops served any time.  Jamie included, sort of as footnotes, the footage that had been released. He was referencing, like, 40-second clips. But as I went deeper into those and their sources, which were all up on a Vimeo channel administered by COPA (Chicago’s Civilian Office of Police Accountability), you could get the entire reel of what the police had shot. And then he had a mother lode of other body-worn camera footage, which he gave me. I showed him a bit of a rough treatment of what I planned to do with this and he got very excited and said, Here’s everything I got.  I went back to that footage and I saw that you could tell the story from many different angles continuously, synchronously. So I started applying rules. One of the rules was that you should always be able to see the victim alive or dead. I might have broken that a couple of times, but for the most part Augustus is on view from the moment the police encounter happens till he’s carried away in the ambulance. So I said to myself, let me see how far I can take that. And then you’re sort of aware of this guy everyone is ignoring. You know, the actual corpse and he’s also belied the main lies of the police [that Augustus had attacked them]. I thought there was a way to put it together where there was this bunch of different views. And, as I started playing with it, I realized it also heightened your anxiety to have the same thing happening from a different point of view [simultaneously visible], sharing the same audio, that all of a sudden you didn’t know where to look, where to read, and as a viewer you became sort of vulnerable.  How long did you work on it?  I would say I began it in September of 2022 and I wrapped it in March, so six months.  How did you finance it?  It’s all public-domain footage. It didn’t cost me anything. It just cost me time.  What did you do with the footage in postproduction?  There was one session with the audio, we had to decide whose mic [among the multicam footage appearing onscreen at once] was going to stand out the most, when we were going to go into surround sound, what rules to make for that.  Composed music has been central to your films. Did you ever consider music for Incident?  Once I came up with the idea that I wanted to start with that wide shot and then back into it, that of course is all silent because it’s on the POD (police observation device), I thought it might be confusing to people, projectionists for instance, to have the first minute and a half silent, and that there was an opportunity there for [a musical] artist.  Hypnotic Pictures and Invisible Institute  But by the time I finished it, I realized what an important role silence was playing. I realized you had to start with silence to realize how little you knew about what was going on from seeing these cyphers [small figures in the wide opening shot] on the street. And you don’t have the audio to tell you the story, and that at the end when all the police officers turn their body cams off … you go back to silence. You’re back out on that same street without a clue. Like it’s all been cleaned up and that spoke to the fact that we don’t control that media or who has access to it; without the cooperation of the police, we wouldn’t know what was happening. It speaks to who owns the media and how it gets out.…  Also, in defense of the police, they can’t be asked to turn cameras on and off when it gets hot, so I think those cameras should be on all the time. I think they should be uploading all the time. According to Jamie, who spoke to Axon [the body-cam manufacturer], the 30-second buffer, where you can see video from 30 seconds before but not [hear the] audio, is to protect the police from something stupid they might have said 30 seconds before that could have exacerbated or escalated things.  Hypnotic Pictures and Invisible Institute  Given the Invisible Institute installation’s existence, why make Incident?  Well, I’m somewhat opportunistic with my projects. I like to find a project that’s supported by an archive. Dawson City was supported by an archive. The Village Detective was supported by [the reels dredged from the sea] and, by extrapolation, the larger Russian archive. So as a filmmaker who works by himself, who doesn’t shoot a lot of original material, I’m interested in trying to tell a story with, if not a single archive, an archive that’s implied by a group of archives. So, in this instance, I saw an incredibly rich and deep story that could be told with a single body of work.  I also thought that I’d said [in past works] a lot about the archive by referencing stuff that was old. And that the archive is becoming increasingly important as a harbinger of what actually happened; it’s becoming less and less clear what actually happened and that this was a prime example of it, even with all this material you can draw different conclusions about what actually happened, and that’s without deep fakes or AI or anything like that. So even an incredibly well-mediated moment when there are more cameras than there should be on a given instant, which is also a product of our racism and paranoia, there’s an archive that can tell this story in a rich but also ambiguous way. And it was almost immediately clear to me that the work that Jamie had done was incredibly helpful groundwork, but it had not gone into this type of cinema.…  I guess another big difference between what I did and what they did is that I included a lot of crowd commentary that becomes a chorus. One person says, What do y’all need this yellow tape for? You know what y’all did … And really there’s a way in which this entire story could be told from the perspective of that riot and what caused this riot [about three hours later, when the police attacked protesters], where you start there and you go backward. I didn’t want there to be time breaks [as there are in Six Durations]. So I became obsessed with this as a continuous story. There was something compelling about watching how this unfolds, how quickly it happened, how quickly it was all swept up. But also the endlessness of it. How this corpse was lying there endlessly and also how time can seem to stand still.  What was the political impact of Six Durations of a Split Second in Chicago?  I’d say that Harith Augustus is still not a well-known name. That South Shore community knows him, but he hasn’t gained the pantheon of Laquan McDonald, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor. He’s not like a well-known name that a European would know. The Americans who were in the audience [in Europe] were like, we don’t know that name either. So, part of that is he was carrying a gun and may or may not have reached for it. The way the news put it, as you see in one of the Invisible Institute essays, the [police] talking heads were like He had a gun and it was over. The police released that footage of him touching his gun, which reframed him as a perpetrator … and the case was closed. He wasn’t martyred. I think that the work Invisible Institute did with Forensic Architecture actually shows that Halley had drawn the gun and was ready to go and so that if you’re in Augustus’s position, you’re between the two cars and turning around, you already see a guy pointing a gun at you, you’re already dead. So why not take a shot, I think it had reached that stage. We don’t have the camera to show that, but that’s what I think happened.  “It’s a bummer of a film. And some of my films as difficult and challenging as they can be, the people who like them are uplifted by them. And this, I think, nobody leaves this film happy.”  Do you see Incident as potentially having a different political impact than Six Durations?  I thought there was a way to tell this story that was also about the media and that was self-reflexive in that way, that was not only politically challenging but challenged the media and talked about what the media can do. So, I got very excited; I got excited by being able to play with something on a media level but that would also have political and cultural impact. And that would also recast what I do.  Do you find it more liberating or confining to produce art from an archive that others have mined for their own interpretation of the same event?  That would assume that everyone had seen Six Durations. So I told the story from the beginning. And I wanted the footage to tell the story. You do have my voice as text giving it context, but it was very important to me that for the most part the footage spoke for itself that it wasn’t manipulated, except for the epilogue, where I slowed it down.  Incident shows that Halley was ready to fire because he was scared. I’m wondering if Augustus was scared, too, because, although he was a licensed handgun owner, he wasn’t a licensed concealed carrier. I looked into what it takes to get an Illinois carrier’s permit. It’s not that hard: $150 and a government-issued ID, plus the Firearms Owners Identification card (gun owner’s permit), which Augustus had on him.  In a state that allows concealed carry, you’re not really allowed to stop someone and say Do you have a license for that unless they’re exhibiting some behavior like brandishing it or threatening someone, where it becomes an issue, so it’s sort of like, Who gets to carry a gun and who doesn’t.  It seems ironic that, as Incident explains, local business owners, who were presumably Black, wanted more cops on the street, and that it’s likely Augustus owned a gun for protection from crime.  There’s great irony. Augustus was in a cash business, sometimes working by himself. It’s a hot summer day. It’s the end of the day. They’re sort of bored. And you’re right, they’ve been ironically put there by the business owners, because, you can’t overemphasize the context of the Laquan McDonald trial, which was just about to happen, so there’s a lot of tension between the community and the cops, and the cops are aware that they’re not well loved in that community. And they’re not from there and they have been dropped in there destined to lose. They haven’t been supported by the system either.  New York, which has at times been a subject of your films, is very important to who you are and what you do. But Chicago is where you’re from and remains central to your identity; you still root for the Bulls and the White Sox. Were you drawn to Augustus’s story because of your connection to Chicago, especially its South Side, where you grew up?  My mom and my sister still live in Hyde Park which is two miles to the north of South Shore. It is a very different neighborhood, but 71st Street [where Incident happens] is a commercial strip. It’s a middle-class neighborhood; Michelle Obama grew up there. And as you can tell from the passersby on the street, there’s an incredible range of people going about their business. Augustus’s killing is kind of a freak occurrence for a place like that.… There was a blues club that I used to go to for years, right around the corner from there, called Lee’s Unleaded that’s probably been closed for five or six years (but there’s a rumor that it will start up again). My connection to that neighborhood is going to Lee’s, which still to this day is absolutely my favorite club ever.  So, in what ways is Incident about you?  If I make a movie about coal miners in the northeast of England [The Miners’ Hymn, 2010], if I make a movie about Dawson City, as an American telling a story about a Canadian city, I never get that question. When I made The Great Flood [2013], all of a sudden it’s about the African American experience moving into Chicago. I said, well, in a certain way that’s more about the neighborhood I grew up in than any of these other films.  Incident is more directly engaged with contemporary politics than anything you’ve done before. But I think all your films are political. That’s not new.  Thank you. Not everybody … I mean in Europe it was like, You finally made a political film and I was like, I’ve been making political films.  I think race is very present in all your films, even in ones that are not directly about race. For instance, Dawson City deals with the indigenous peoples of Yukon, and Decasia, by not being specifically about race, shows us, without narration, incidentally, and therefore powerfully, the prevalence of colonialism, visualized racially, in the West’s film culture.  Yeah. That’s a very interesting point. Buried News, you saw?  Still from 2016’s “Dawson City: Frozen Time.” Kino Lorber  I don’t know it.  It’s the short I made in 2021 using race riots from the Dawson City collection. All of the newsreel footage is about lynch mobs.… It definitely ties in with Incident, and the two films will be shown together someday.  I want to discuss Incident’s form in relation to your prior works.  The big difference is what this material is; it’s low-grade video material so it leant itself to being smaller frames. These wipes and kind of cheesy video effects, I wouldn’t have tried using nitrate film.  What’s compelling to me about Dawson City [Morrison’s feature, which tells the story of, as well as stories around, long-buried and, in many cases, long-lost silent films unexpectedly unearthed in Canada’s Yukon territory] is that, as it itself documents, its footage had been dug up and archived a long time ago. That reveal explicates the heart of what you’ve been doing across your career: less discovering than re-interpreting, using film art to show us things we wouldn’t otherwise see. The same is true in The Village Detective, because its titular source turns out, as you, again, reveal, to be not a lost film but a lost print of a well-known film, which provides an opportunity for new storytelling. And going back to your short The Mesmerist (2003), it re-edited the elliptical remains of decrepit reels of The Bells (1926) — otherwise available as a well-preserved, more-complete feature — to tell a different story, around a specific character, than the one originally told.  Yeah.  Still from 2021’s “The Village Detective.” Kino Lorber  So I’m wondering if Incident’s re-telling of Augustus’s story — where the archival footage has not only already been selectively presented by the Chicago police and then critically reanalyzed by the Invisible Institute — actually clarifies your practice, which has depended less on finding old things than in constructing new stories from them? In other words, despite its many obvious differences in source and form from your prior works, is Incident actually less a jump cut from than a continuation of your practice across your career?  Of course, I think of it as a continuity. I saw what Jamie had done, and I was excited by it, but I also saw an opportunity to further the earlier conversation, the Rashomon conversation that he and I had had, because the installation didn’t do that. It was very important that it got the facts and the context and the history out there. And for me, I saw something more akin to a narrative. And Jamie saw it as a continuation of the work that the Invisible Institute had done.  Way back, when you discussed Dawson City with my students at Brooklyn College’s Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, one asked if you thought in the future you would work with decaying digital media. You answered very declaratively, No, elaborating that you didn’t find digital video visually compelling. After Incident, do you still feel that way?  I get that question a lot.… Students in particular often ask me: Can you see applying this to digital imagery? I don’t think what I obsessed about in Incident was the decay of digital, or even the materiality of the video archive. This is more content based and that’s why I felt more at ease about wiping in and quadrating the footage. I don’t think of this stuff as a physical object. It’s something that got uploaded; it’s a file. The thing is the digital breakdown has very little subtlety to it, it’s either 1 or 0 [computer binary code] and glitches out for a while. There are no happy accidents, or very few; there’s no gradation. There’s a world of romantic imagery within the decay of film you just don’t see in digital video.  From the beginning of your work becoming well known, with Decasia, critics have described it as both raising the dead and evoking mortality. In Incident you deal with an actual death and a video resurrection; you begin with Augustus’s end, with his killing, and then bring him back, observing how his end unfolded on earth in ways, not unlike found-footage characters in your other films, which he can neither witness nor could foresee.  Right, Right.  Does Incident, then, suggestively dramatize, via Augustus’s story, the essence of your own practice, usually with old films, by displacing it onto contemporary video?  You know, I don’t make films thinking about how it fits into my larger body of work. I think it’s interesting, with perspective, to say, Oh wow, that does continue that story. That’s the first time someone’s said that to me, and I wasn’t thinking of that. I think you’re right, though, that the curtain of mortality is always between the audience and what’s intriguing is that it becomes a mirror of our own mortality.  I hope that in some ways people can see themselves in Harith Augustus. I think there’s always going to be that question, Why did he run? You and I wouldn’t have run. It’s a different experience, I think, being a Black guy on the South Side of Chicago and having a bunch of cops come up on you. Your day is not going to end well. You’re not going to be able to walk away and say, Ok, next time I’m going to bring my license. Thanks for that. This is the way that I think it would have gone had [Quincy] Jones [the Black cop who was questioning Augustus before Halley and his partner, Megan Fleming, both white, intervened] continued his conversation. I think it was going to be a warning or a conversation, before it got escalated.  Hypnotic Pictures and Invisible Institute  Do you consider Incident art? I do.  Yeah, I do. If you take the seagull [which flies into the footage that opens and closes Incident], that was a happy accident. It becomes the narrator.  The omen.  Yeah.  Your films have often made me think of Bruce Conner’s works. And Incident made me think particularly of Report (1967), about JFK’s assassination, because of the found footage and especially found sound from broadcast news.  That’s a great comparison. Yeah and also Perfect Movie (1986), by Ken Jacobs, that’s news footage in the wake of Malcolm X’s assassination. So, in a certain way Incident is found public footage that tells a story reassembled. I love the Conner comparison.  Do you think that art can keep this story alive? We’ve become so desensitized to police killings. By documenting this story in this form do you think Incident has, do you hope it has, the potential to re-sensitize people to this all-too-familiar tragedy, because we view it in an unexpected format rather than just clips on the news or social media.  Right. And also, it is a timely piece, an evergreen piece, but it’s not about something that happened yesterday. It happened five years ago. In a way it becomes iconic in that way. I think what makes it a compelling story is that it doesn’t come out and say that there’s a right or wrong here. I certainly think it could have ended differently and could have been avoided, but there is an ambiguity, which makes it a more interesting case. There were all these cameras on and we still don’t really know what Augustus’s intent was. We do know that he didn’t draw.  He never unholstered it; he was trying not to drop it.  Maybe he was trying to keep his pants up.  Has Incident changed you?  I don’t know how it’s going to change my work. It was a long time [spent via the archival footage] on that street corner in 2018, immersed in that kind of arcane examination and relistening, and the acute choreography of how a moment goes down.… So that placed me in a certain time and a place like I’ve never done before. That was different. I went back to Chicago in November [2022] and went right to that block and walked up and down it; the trees had grown a little higher but I saw where the railing around where the tree pit was and the cracks and I went to the sandwich shop and got a sandwich and everybody looked at me like I was a cop! [laughs].  How does it feel to see Incident finally out in the world?  Seeing it in Europe, I knew that in some ways I was in a safe zone, because I’m presenting our freaky country with our freaky gun laws. Everybody could say you guys are freaks and I could agree with them. We are. ❖  Seth Fein is a historian and documentarian. He operates Seven Local Film in Jackson Heights, Queens, where he lives.

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Baltimore Sun.  The Baltimore Police officer who chased and shot a 17-year-old from behind in May will not be criminally charged, the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office determined.  Nor will the officers who in February pursued a reportedly stolen vehicle that subsequently crashed into another car, then collided with a pedestrian, killing him, according to declination reports posted online by State’s Attorney Ivan Bates’ office.  Advertisement  Baltimore prosecutors wrote that the actions of Officer Cedric Elleby, who shot the teen in Southwest Baltimore’s Shipley Hill neighborhood, were “objectively reasonable,” and that the officers who had sought the fleeing vehicle “acted reasonably and lawfully” and “did not cause the fatal accident that killed” Alfred Fincher, the pedestrian.  The two reviews of police-involved fatalities for possible criminal charges are likely among the last to be conducted by Baltimore prosecutors, as the power to make such charging decisions statewide was transferred to the Office of Attorney General, effective Oct. 1.  Advertisement  The first police case in which the Attorney General will have prosecutorial decision-making is Tuesday’s fatal police shooting in Baltimore’s Millhill neighborhood. It has drawn scrutiny this week and led to comparisons to the Shipley Hill incident from May.  In both, members of the Baltimore Police Department’s District Action Team approached residents and attempted to stop them because they believed the individuals to be armed. Both residents fled on foot and were chased by police who then shot them.  [ After Baltimore Police fatally shoot man in Millhill, neighbors question whether foot pursuit was necessary ]  Footage from Tuesday’s police shooting has not been publicly released yet, while Elleby’s body camera footage showed him ordering the teen to drop a weapon and to stop, then firing his weapon four times, striking the teen at least once. The teen survived the shooting but was critically injured.  In prosecutors’ review, they wrote that before Elleby fired his weapon, the teen had “turned slightly to his right.” His right arm, in which he held his gun, also moved to the right, prosecutors said, “as if [he] and his gun were turning toward the [officer].” Prosecutors also added he was running toward a man on nearby porch steps.  “In the split second that the [teen] swung his arm to his right, a reasonable officer could have believed that the [teen] was turning himself towards the officer to shoot at him,” the report said. “It appears clear that that’s what the [officer] thought as well, as that’s the moment that he opened fire.”  Beyond fearing for his own safety, prosecutors added, the officer “would have” feared for the safety of the entire community, including the man on the steps.  The report did acknowledge the possibility that the teen was “merely trying to dispose of his firearm,” and that he was going to turn into the nearby alleyway to continue running from the officer. But Elleby “simply could not assume either of those facts at the moment he pulled the trigger,” prosecutors wrote.  “What the [officer] saw in front of him was an armed man running towards another man and ignoring lawful orders,” it said.  Advertisement  The 16-page report also examined the initial stop of the teen. The two District Action Team detectives believed a group gathered along McHenry Street were “likely involved in illegal activity,” and thus decided to engage, according to prosecutors. When they got closer, they noticed a “bulge” in the teen’s waistband and Elleby “decided that he needed to investigate.”  That, prosecutors said, was “more than a hunch.”  Baltimore Police had been criticized for an initial statement that the 17-year-old had been “displaying characteristics of an armed person,” which some residents and other critics suggested was vague terminology created to justify stopping people.  [ After Baltimore Police shooting, some question: What does ‘displaying characteristics of an armed person’ really mean? ]  “We’re relying on these officers’ testimony in court that they’re getting it right all the time, and it’s a very nebulous area,” defense attorney Natalie Finegar said in May. “Basically, you’re saying ‘somebody’s holding their arm funny,’ ‘somebody’s walking funny’ — but you don’t even know necessarily if that person has some sort of physical disability.”  Breaking News Alerts As it happens Be informed of breaking news as it happens and notified about other don't-miss content with our free news alerts.

One resident, Mike Davis, argued this week that police should stop chasing people solely in pursuit of firearms, saying “don’t chase us and shoot us just for all that.”  The other report, into February’s fatal crash, found that officers’ initial pursuit of the stolen vehicle was lawful. It was terminated by a lieutenant over the radio, according to prosecutors, but could have continued under relevant law.  Advertisement  The report quotes the lieutenant as saying, “Alright, just let it go, guys, it’s westbound on Sinclair, it’s traveling at a high rate of speed. It looks like it’s gonna go southbound on Wolfe and come out around,” then adding seconds later, “It’s not worth it, break it off.”  The nearest police officer at that point decelerated and continued to drive southbound behind the car, slightly less than one block behind. The prosecutors’ declination report identifies that officer as “Yancey,” with no last name, but the Independent Investigations Division and a city salary database both list him as Devin Yancy.  It was “mere seconds later” that the fleeing vehicle ran a red light, collided with another car, then struck a pedestrian, Fincher, the report found. The car also struck a vacant building that then collapsed.  In reviewing available evidence, prosecutors put “particular emphasis” on the statement of one of the people inside the allegedly stolen vehicle, who said she wasn’t aware officers were pursuing it when the collision occurred, and the statement of a bus driver who told police he saw “no evidence of a police chase” at the time of the crash.  Prosecutors concluded that the police officers “acted reasonably and lawfully.”"

But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the departmentâs latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today. Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life. They said the deadly police shooting has drawn attention to an issue they have been complaining about for years: that certain officers are known in the majority-Black community for harassing residents and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters. âTheyâre always jumping out on us for no reason. It happens all the time,â said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. âNow, we see the consequences.â McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots. Officials said officers on a District Action Team â squads focused on seizing illegal guns â were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the cityâs most violent neighborhoods. In the immediate aftermath of Tuesdayâs shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officersâ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon. âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said at the scene Tuesday. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months. Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the cityâs Black community. After Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms. Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders. Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Universityâs Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach. âThe focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,â he said. âCommunities donât want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.â A study published by Websterâs team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but thereâs âa ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrustâ â partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence. Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimoreâs low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era. âThe name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,â researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers âfocus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.â She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the departmentâs internal discipline process. âDue to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,â Eldridge said. âThese teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.â Less than six months before Tuesdayâs shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying âcharacteristics of an armed person.â The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them. âThey look at everybody as suspects unless youâre old or a certain color,â Rashawn McNeil said. âItâs dehumanizing. Thatâs what it is.â"

The San Diego Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, identified the man as 48-year-old Douglas Quinn of Indiana, who was on parole.  The Escondido Police Department officers involved in the shooting were identified as Anthony Lay and Michael Statti. Lay is a six-year employee of the department, while Statti has worked for the department for one year as a patrol officer.  Advertisement  The events that led to the fatal shootout began shortly after 6:30 a.m. last Friday, when Escondido police received a report of a trespasser asleep in a sleeping bag on the porch of a mobile home on East Valley Parkway, according to the San Diego Police Department.  San Diego investigates police shootings in Escondido under the terms of a countywide agreement to prevent conflicts of interest.  The two Escondido police officers arrived at the mobile home park about 10 minutes later and stopped Quinn, who had since been reported as being seen pushing a motorcycle through the complex.  “During the contact, based on the information provided by the (man), they learned he had a felony warrant for a parole violation out of Indiana,” San Diego police Lt. Jud Campbell said. “As officers began to detain (him), he turned and began to run. He also began reaching into his waistband.”  The suspect then allegedly pulled a gun, pointed it across his body at the officers and opened fire, according to police. The officers returned fire, wounding the suspect, who fell to the ground, the lieutenant said.  “He then rolled over with the gun, again pointing it in the direction of (the) officers, prompting one of them to fire several more rounds at him,” Campbell said. The officers provided first aid to the mortally wounded suspect prior to the arrival of paramedics. An ambulance crew took Quinn to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No other injuries were reported.  Once San Diego police completes the investigation, the county District Attorney’s Office will review it to determine if either officer will face any charges.

Baltimore police shooting prompts criticism of specialized gun squads,2023-11-09,2023-11-10T02:48:44Z,en,washingtontimes.com,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/nov/9/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-spe/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110024844id_/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/nov/9/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-spe/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110024844/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/nov/9/baltimore-police-shooting-prompts-criticism-of-spe/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHdhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcykvbmV3cy8yMDIzL25vdi85L2JhbHRpbW9yZS1wb2xpY2Utc2hvb3RpbmctcHJvbXB0cy1jcml0aWNpc20tb2Ytc3BlP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09cnNzJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9cnNzX2ZlZWQ~,"BALTIMORE — After a corruption scandal led the Baltimore Police Department to disband its plainclothes gun squad in 2017, the embattled agency pledged to increase oversight while remaining focused on seizing illegal weapons and curbing rampant violence.  But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the department’s latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today.  Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life. They said the deadly police shooting has drawn attention to an issue they have been complaining about for years: that certain officers are known in the majority-Black community for harassing residents and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters.  “They’re always jumping out on us for no reason. It happens all the time,” said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. “Now, we see the consequences.”  McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots.  Officials said officers on a District Action Team - squads focused on seizing illegal guns - were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital.  The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the city’s most violent neighborhoods.  In the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officers’ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon.  “This is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,” Worley said at the scene Tuesday. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months.  Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the city’s Black community.  After Freddie Gray’s 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms.  Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders.  Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach.  “The focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,” he said. “Communities don’t want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.”  A study published by Webster’s team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but there’s “a ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrust” - partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence.  Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimore’s low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era.  “The name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,” researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.  Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers “focus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.” She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the department’s internal discipline process.  “Due to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,” Eldridge said. “These teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.”  Less than six months before Tuesday’s shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying “characteristics of an armed person.” The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind.  McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them.  “They look at everybody as suspects unless you’re old or a certain color,” Rashawn McNeil said. “It’s dehumanizing. That’s what it is.”"

It has continued to use the killing machinery crafted by President George W. Bush, expanded by President Barack Obama and employed by President Donald Trump. These presidents have used drones and other unmanned projectiles to target persons in foreign countries with which the United States is not at war.  They have done this notwithstanding the prohibition against taking life, liberty or property from any person — not just any American, but any person — in the Constitution each has sworn to uphold, and they have done so pursuant to secret rules that they themselves have established for these killings.  Last year, 11 senators and 39 members of the House of Representatives sent a harshly worded letter to President Joe Biden asking him to stop the secret, but not the public, killings. As of this writing, he has not publicly replied.  Here is the backstory.  The purpose of the Bill of Rights — the first 10 amendments to the Constitution — is to protect personal liberty by restraining the government.  The Fifth Amendment prohibits killing persons, restraining liberty and taking property without due process; that means a jury trial at which the government must prove criminal behavior or fault, depending upon its goal.  If the country is at war — lawfully and constitutionally declared by Congress — obviously the president can use the U.S. military to kill the military of the opposing country. And if an attack on the U.S. is imminent, the president can strike the first blow against the military of the entity whose attack is just about to occur.  There are no other constitutional circumstances under which a president may kill.  When President Harry Truman targeted Japanese civilians as the Japanese government was within days of surrendering in World War II, he murdered them. Notwithstanding his unprosecuted war crimes, and with the government’s version of Pearl Harbor still fresh in many Americans’ minds, Truman was regarded as heroic for using nuclear bombs to cause the profoundly immoral, militarily useless and plainly criminal mass killings of the hated Japanese.  Fast-forward to the 9/11 era, and Bush had precedent to begin his own presidential killings of people the government wanted Americans to hate. While Congress did authorize him to use force against those who caused or aided the 9/11 attacks, we all know that his thirst for Middle Eastern blood knew no regard for the Constitution, evidence, proportionality, civilian lives, morality or human decency. Thus, $3 trillion spent and 1 million dead in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Julian Assange sits in a British dungeon awaiting decisions on his extradition to the U.S. because he courageously, lawfully and constitutionally published documents and videos demonstrating conclusively that Bush’s use of drones targeted and murdered Afghan and Iraqi civilians, and his administration covered it up.  Obama took this to another level when he targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in the U.S. Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, advised Obama that the killing was lawful, as al-Awlaki had encouraged folks in the Middle East to fight against American soldiers there. Holder likened killing al-Awlaki to police shooting at a bank robber whom they are chasing while he is shooting at them.  Holder forgot that al-Awlaki was unarmed, was not charged or indicted for any crime, was never accused of violence, and was not even the subject of an arrest warrant when a drone evaporated him while sitting at an outdoor cafe in Yemen.  The exercise of power by the federal government is largely based on precedent and politics. Whenever a president wants to kill, he need only find an example of a predecessor having killed with impunity — without due process, without a declaration of war and without an imminent attack. And then he needs only to calculate what he thinks he can politically get away with.  Joe Biden — whose drones in 2021 destroyed a dam in Syria, killing thousands, and who targeted civilians in Afghanistan, killing dozens, and whose shipments of guns to Ukraine and Israel are killing tens of thousands of folks he wants us to hate — is using unlawful powers that his modern predecessors used and got away with to target and kill unsympathetic persons. But the U.S. has not declared war on Russia or Gaza.  The nature of political power is to expand so that it fills a perceived need, unless there are mechanisms in place to restrain its expansion.  The founding generation believed that British monarchs had no limits on their powers and that was a good enough reason for the 13 colonies to secede violently. They also believed that they had crafted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to impose sufficient restraints on the federal government. And they believed that the states could peacefully leave a federal government they had voluntarily joined when it exceeded its constitutional powers.

Its language is clear that only Congress writes laws and declares war, and presidents can kill only troops in wartime or civilians consistent with due process.  Sadly, the Founders were wrong.  Every president takes an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution as it was written, not as he may wish it to be.  Yet, today, the president writes laws and rules that let him restrain personal liberty and kill with impunity, and Congress and the American people let him get away with it. Formally, we still have a Constitution. Functionally, it has utterly failed to restrain the government.  Ultimately, we have ourselves to blame for these killings and undeclared wars. Why do we repose the Constitution for safekeeping into the hands of those who subvert it? If a future president uses Bush’s lust and Obama’s logic and Biden’s hatreds to kill Americans in America, then no one’s life, liberty or property will be secure.

It happens all the time,â said Rashawn McNeil, who lives around the corner from the shooting scene. âNow, we see the consequences.â McNeil, 25, said he heard a barrage of gunfire and questioned why police fired so many shots. Officials said officers on a District Action Team â squads focused on seizing illegal guns â were conducting proactive patrols when they approached a man who showed signs of being armed. The man, later identified as Hunter Jessup, started running and allegedly pointed a gun at police during the ensuing chase. Four officers opened fire and Jessup, 27, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The following day, McNeil was hanging out with his brother and a friend in their usual spot outside an abandoned corner store. The group said DAT officers treat them with disdain and routinely initiate negative interactions. They said the officers are easily recognizable because of their unique attire. Neither fully uniformed nor plainclothes, they wear vests identifying them as police and patrol the cityâs most violent neighborhoods. In the immediate aftermath of Tuesdayâs shooting, Police Commissioner Richard Worley defended the officersâ actions, saying they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon. âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said at the scene Tuesday. Police leaders often commend officers for getting illegal firearms off the streets, and Baltimore gun violence overall has been trending downward in recent months. Department leadership created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded in the wake of federal racketeering charges that accused several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the Baltimore Police Department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the cityâs Black community. After Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries sustained in police custody, a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern of unconstitutional policing practices and the department remains under a federal consent decree mandating a series of court-ordered reforms. Other cities have similarly grappled with the use of specialized police units in recent years. In Memphis, police leaders permanently disbanded their SCORPION unit after publicly released body camera video showed five of its members beating Tyre Nichols to death. The plainclothes task force was focused on illegal guns and repeat violent offenders. Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Universityâs Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore, said the success of specialized gun units often hinges on a focused approach. âThe focus should be on the people who are actually creating the violence,â he said. âCommunities donât want DAT teams jumping out and clearing corners; they want them to do actual police work and target those individuals.â A study published by Websterâs team in 2020 found that about two-thirds of respondents thought Baltimore police were targeting the wrong people. Webster said there is no convincing evidence that blanket enforcement of gun laws makes communities safer, but thereâs âa ton of evidence to support that it causes a lot of harm and distrustâ â partly because people often carry weapons for self-protection, not because they are intending to commit violence. Critics say the DAT teams inevitably have a disproportionate effect on Baltimoreâs low-income communities of color because their mission is to proactively patrol neighborhoods most plagued by violence. And that has not changed since the Gun Trace Task Force era. âThe name of the units may be new, but many of the troublesome tactics persist,â researchers wrote of the teams in a report released earlier this year by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Baltimore police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said that in addition to conducting proactive patrols, DAT officers âfocus on making strategic arrests of key individuals that are perpetuating violent crime.â She said the department takes misconduct complaints seriously and imposes discipline when appropriate. Recent reforms have included an overhaul of the departmentâs internal discipline process. âDue to their role and enforcement function, we understand that our DATs are subject to a greater number of complaints in the execution of their duties,â Eldridge said. âThese teams focus on many high-level offenses that can produce dangerous interactions.â Less than six months before Tuesdayâs shooting, another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances several blocks away. That encounter also involved DAT officers who tried to stop a teenager they said was displaying âcharacteristics of an armed person.â The teen ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. McNeil and his older brother, Rashad McNeil, said they are tired of having to assert their constitutional rights whenever certain officers approach them. âThey look at everybody as suspects unless youâre old or a certain color,â Rashawn McNeil said. âItâs dehumanizing. Thatâs what it is.â Top headlines by email, weekday mornings Get top headlines from the Union-Tribune in your inbox weekday mornings, including top news, local, sports, business, entertainment and opinion.

Former Louisville officer charged in Breonna Taylor raid says he was defending fellow officers,2023-11-09,2023-11-11T02:14:48Z,en,newsday.com,https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/former-louisville-officer-charged-in-breonna-taylor-raid-says-he-was-defending-fellow-officers-jyrlpll4,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111021448id_/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/former-louisville-officer-charged-in-breonna-taylor-raid-says-he-was-defending-fellow-officers-jyrlpll4,https://web.archive.org/web/20231111021448/https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/former-louisville-officer-charged-in-breonna-taylor-raid-says-he-was-defending-fellow-officers-jyrlpll4,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG5ld3NkYXkpL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uL2Zvcm1lci1sb3Vpc3ZpbGxlLW9mZmljZXItY2hhcmdlZC1pbi1icmVvbm5hLXRheWxvci1yYWlkLXNheXMtaGUtd2FzLWRlZmVuZGluZy1mZWxsb3ctb2ZmaWNlcnMtanlybHBsbDQ~,"Former Louisville officer charged in Breonna Taylor raid says he was defending fellow officers LOUISVILLE, Ky. â The ex-Louisville police officer on trial for firing into Breonna Taylorâs apartment the night she was killed testified Thursday he had to react quickly after a fellow officer was shot in the leg during the drug raid. Brett Hankison said he saw a muzzle flash come from inside Taylorâs hallway after officers knocked down the door in the early hours of March 13, 2020, to execute a search warrant. He testified he believed it sounded like an assault rifle, so he moved to the side of Taylorâs apartment and fired shots in through a sliding glass door and window. âI had to react,â Hankison said on the witness stand in U.S. District Court Thursday. âI had no choice.â Taylorâs boyfriend had fired a single shot at officers after they came through the door, and two officers at the entry returned fire, striking and killing Taylor in the hallway of her apartment. While no one was hit by the 10 shots he fired, prosecutors have argued Hankison was shooting erratically without identifying a target. Some of his gunshots went into an occupied neighboring apartment. Hankison said he moved away from the entry door, rounded the corner of the apartment and sprayed bullets into the side windows and sliding glass door because he believed a shooter was advancing on officers in the doorway. He said he believed the officers âwere taking automatic gunfire and were trapped.â The officers at the door fired a combined 22 shots after Taylor's boyfriend fired a single round. âIt sounded like he was walking up on us ... like he was executingâ the other officers, Hankison said. Hankison, 47, has been charged with two federal civil rights violations for endangering Taylor, her boyfriend and Taylorâs neighbors, who shared a wall with her apartment. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Federal prosecutors are attempting to do what Kentucky prosecutors couldnât â convict Hankison for his actions on the night Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot to death. He was acquitted by a jury last year of wanton endangerment charges. Prosecutors at this trial have argued Hankison did not follow police use of force policies when he decided to fire through Taylor's windows and sliding door. When his attorney asked him about that, he said he âdidnât have time to think about a policy.â âYouâre acting to save lives, or not acting and people are going to die,â Hankison said. Hankison said he feels âhorribleâ about Taylor's death and that it was âtragic for a lot of people and a lot of families."" Her death along with George Floydâs at the hands of Minneapolis police officers sparked weeks of protests over police brutality in the summer of 2020. Hankison was also critical of the warrant, saying he and the other officers should have never been sent to her apartment that night. The Taylor warrant was one of five served simultaneously the night she was killed, part of a wide-ranging narcotics operation targeting a known drug dealer. The dealer was located in another part of town but had a previous relationship with Taylor. Three other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant have been charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify against former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany in their trial next year. The former Louisville officer shot by Taylor's boyfriend during the raid, Jonathan Mattingly, also testified Thursday, saying he was standing in front of the door when it opened and saw a muzzle flash in the dark. He said he saw two figures at the end of the hallway before he was shot. Mattingly, who retired from the police force in 2021, said he couldn't tell where Hankison was standing when the shots started, but heard a âbarrageâ of gunfire at the side of the building. Hankison's testimony will continue in federal court on Monday. Northwell patient data breach ... First game since student's deathÂ ... Boy Scouts honor vets ...

But several years later, two recent police shootings involving the departmentâs latest iteration of the specialized units have raised questions about how they are operating today. Officials have not yet released body camera footage of the most recent shooting, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, but residents of the southwest Baltimore neighborhood expressed outrage over what they called an unnecessary loss of life.

"After Baltimore Police fatally shoot man in Millhill, neighbors question whether foot pursuit was necessary",2023-11-09,2023-11-10T02:58:15Z,en,baltimoresun.com,https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-shooting-millhill-20231109-iq46n5vshzejzgxotzqujvqoey-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110025815id_/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-shooting-millhill-20231109-iq46n5vshzejzgxotzqujvqoey-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231110025815/https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-shooting-millhill-20231109-iq46n5vshzejzgxotzqujvqoey-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bikvbWFyeWxhbmQvYmFsdGltb3JlLWNpdHkvYnMtbWQtY2ktYmFsdGltb3JlLXBvbGljZS1zaG9vdGluZy1taWxsaGlsbC0yMDIzMTEwOS1pcTQ2bjV2c2h6ZWp6Z3hvdHpxdWp2cW9leS1zdG9yeS5odG1s,"About 24 hours after Baltimore Police shot a man on Wilkens Avenue in Southwest Baltimore, a group of friends gathered across the street and described some of Hunter Jessup’s final moments. One of them who said he witnessed the shooting in the Millhill neighborhood described watching Jessup flee police while gripping his pants and a backpack, then falling amid rapid gunfire. Neighbors, meanwhile, questioned whether the fatal police foot chase was necessary and lamented the tense relationship between residents and police officers who patrol the neighborhood seeking guns. In an interview, Mike Davis, 28, asked why so many officers couldn’t arrest Jessup without killing him, and said police should stop engaging in foot pursuits just to get guns off the streets. “If we got guns on us and we running from you, don’t chase us and shoot us just for all that,” said Davis, who said he heard 10 to 15 shots Tuesday from inside his home on Wilkens Avenue. “If we know running away is not going to help us, we’re going to shoot” officers. Police have said multiple officers fired at a man who pointed a gun at them as he ran from them. Authorities have not identified the individual who was pronounced dead at University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, but police said Tuesday they believed he was an adult. Two of his brothers identified him as Hunter Jessup, who neighbors said lived in the 2700 block of Wilkens Avenue with his girlfriend. Police Commissioner Richard Worley said police recovered a handgun with an extended magazine from the scene. On Wednesday afternoon, blood stained the sidewalk in the 2600 block of Wilkens Avenue, in what is Baltimore’s longest unbroken row of townhomes. A broken window and a twisted railing that appeared to have been hit by a bullet were visible in the middle of the nearly treeless block. Friends and his brothers remembered Jessup as a giving person who kept to himself. Amare, a 14-year-old neighbor whose mother asked that he be identified only by his first name, said Jessup was “always goofy.” “We was always sitting right there, goofing around, listening to music everyday,” Amare said. “This one day, police took him from me.” Southwest District Action Team officers initially tried to stop Jessup near the corner of Brunswick and St. Benedict streets because they believed he had a gun, Worley said Tuesday. The commissioner said there had been “several shootings” in the area and officers were doing a “proactive patrol.” The city’s crime map shows the Millhill neighborhood has seen one aggravated assault and some burglary and larceny offenses in the past 28 days, but no homicides or attempted murders. It lists three shootings in the past year. Since the July 9 police redistricting, the Southwestern District has experienced eight homicides and 31 nonfatal shootings, as of Nov. 4. The city overall is seeing a decline in homicides and nonfatal shootings this year — 228 homicides, as of Wednesday, compared to 289 at the same time in 2022; and 557 nonfatal shootings so far, compared to 619 last year. Police spokesperson Lindsey Eldridge said in an email Wednesday that there have been 146 gun arrests in the Southwest District as of Nov. 5, up 5% compared to the same time last year. Earlier this year, a District Action Team member shot and wounded a 17-year-old in nearby Shipley Hill. The teams are specialized squads that a district commander can direct toward patrol needs or violent crime arrests. They also play a role in the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy, an initiative geared toward dismantling groups behind the city’s shootings. Eldridge said Wednesday that officers who pursued Jessup were on routine patrol, unrelated to the Group Violence Reduction Strategy. Some have suggested District Actions Teams are a rebranding of the department’s past controversial flex squads. Critics say it’s important to scrutinize both the work of the teams and the selection of members. Similar to Tuesday’s Millhill shooting, the officer in the Shipley Hill police shooting approached an individual, suspecting he was armed. That teen also fled. In Shipley Hill, Officer Cedric Elleby could be heard in body camera footage ordering the teen to drop his weapon, before then shooting the teen from behind. Worley said Tuesday that officers also warned Jessup to drop his weapon before firing. In late June, Baltimore Police officers shot and killed a 40-year-old Baltimore man in East Baltimore on June 29. Two of the five officers who fired their weapons in the shooting were Southeast District officers, while two were assigned to the Eastern District Action Team, according to the Attorney General’s Office. The fifth was part of a Southeast/East Side Initiative, the office said in a news release. Body camera footage in that shooting showed Darryl Gamble, who was wanted by police, shoot at officers before they returned fire. The five officers fired about 40 rounds, police have said. Roughly 33 casings from Gamble’s weapons were recovered, police said in July. Tuesday’s shooting was captured on body camera, officials said. It likely will be released publicly in coming days. [ Baltimore Police fatally shoot man who they say pointed gun at officers Tuesday afternoon in Millhill ] D, an 18-year-old who asked to be identified by his nickname for safety reasons, said members of the District Action Teams harass him and his friends. “We’re being children, we’re being kids,” he said. “Kids gonna be outside.” Breaking News Alerts Worley said Tuesday that Jessup drew a gun before an officer tackled him. He pointed his weapon at police before multiple officers fired at him, then immediately rendered aid, Worley said. Tuesday’s police shooting will be the first investigated by the Office of Attorney General’s Independent Investigations Division since the office’s prosecutors were granted authority to bring criminal charges against officers in police-involved civilian fatalities. The Maryland General Assembly earlier this year granted the Attorney General prosecutorial power in those cases, which can include in-custody deaths, police shootings and fatalities following police pursuits. It marked a shift from recent years when those investigations were handed over to local prosecutors for final determinations. The law change went into effect Oct. 1. The attorney general recently hired a deputy chief of litigation and is currently in the process of hiring an additional prosecutor and a paralegal evidence/analyst, spokesperson Thomas Lester said in an email to The Baltimore Sun. Going forward, the unit will no longer forward its investigative report to local prosecutors but instead announce its own decision."

It didnât indicate whether he died from the shooting or the knife injuries. Officers were called to a Long Beach home shortly before 9 a.m. Tuesday by reports that a man had stabbed his mother, who was hiding in a room.

It has continued to use the killing machinery crafted by President George W. Bush, expanded by President Barack Obama and employed by President Donald Trump. These presidents have used drones and other unmanned projectiles to target people in foreign countries with which the United States is not at war.  They have done this notwithstanding the prohibition against taking life, liberty or property from any person — not just any American, but any person — in the Constitution each has sworn to uphold, and they have done so pursuant to secret rules that they themselves have established for these killings.  Last year, 11 senators and 39 members of the House of Representatives sent a harshly worded letter to President Biden asking him to stop the secret, but not the public, killings. As of this writing, he has not publicly replied.  Here is the backstory.  The purpose of the Bill of Rights — the first 10 amendments to the Constitution — is to protect personal liberty by restraining the government.  The Fifth Amendment prohibits killing persons, restraining liberty and taking property without due process; that means a jury trial at which the government must prove criminal behavior or fault, depending upon its goal.  If the country is at war — lawfully and constitutionally declared by Congress — the president can use the U.S. military to kill the military of the opposing country. And if an attack on the U.S. is imminent, the president can strike the first blow against the military of the entity whose attack is imminent.  There are no other constitutional circumstances under which a president may kill.  When President Harry Truman targeted Japanese civilians as the Japanese government was within days of surrendering in World War II, he murdered them. Notwithstanding his unprosecuted war crimes, and with the government’s version of Pearl Harbor still fresh in many Americans’ minds, Truman was regarded as heroic for using nuclear bombs to cause the immoral, militarily useless and plainly criminal mass killings of the hated Japanese.  Fast-forward to the 9/11 era, and Mr. Bush had precedent to begin his own presidential killings of people the government wanted Americans to hate. While Congress did authorize him to use force against those who caused or aided the 9/11 attacks, we all know that his thirst for Middle Eastern blood knew no regard for the Constitution, evidence, proportionality, civilian lives, morality or human decency. Thus, $3 trillion was spent, and 1 million people lost their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Julian Assange sits in a British dungeon awaiting decisions on his extradition to the U.S. because he courageously, lawfully and constitutionally published documents and videos demonstrating conclusively that Mr. Bush’s use of drones targeted and murdered Afghan and Iraqi civilians, and his administration covered it up.  Mr. Obama took this to another level when he targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in the U.S. Mr. Obama’s then-attorney general, Eric Holder, advised Mr. Obama that the killing was lawful, as al-Awlaki had encouraged people in the Middle East to fight against American soldiers there. Mr. Holder likened killing al-Awlaki to police shooting at a bank robber they are chasing while he is shooting at them.  Mr. Holder forgot that al-Awlaki was unarmed, was not charged with any crime, was never accused of violence, and was not even the subject of an arrest warrant when a drone evaporated him while he sat at an outdoor cafe in Yemen.  The exercise of power by the federal government is largely based on precedent and politics. Whenever a president wants to kill, he need only find an example of a predecessor having killed with impunity — without due process, without a declaration of war and without an imminent attack. And then he needs only to calculate what he thinks he can politically get away with.  Mr. Biden — whose drones in 2021 destroyed a dam in Syria, killing thousands, and who targeted civilians in Afghanistan, killing dozens, and whose shipments of guns to Ukraine and Israel are killing tens of thousands of people he wants us to hate — is using unlawful powers that his modern predecessors used and got away with to target and kill people he sees as unsympathetic. But the U.S. has not declared war on Russia or Gaza.  The nature of political power is to expand so that it fills a perceived need unless there are mechanisms in place to restrain its expansion.  The founding generation believed that British monarchs had no limits on their power, and that was a good enough reason for the 13 colonies to violently secede. They also believed that they had crafted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to impose sufficient restraints on the federal government. They believed that the states could peacefully leave a federal government they had voluntarily joined when it exceeded its constitutional powers.  The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Its language is clear that only Congress writes laws and declares war, and presidents can kill only troops in wartime or civilians consistent with due process.  Sadly, the Founders were wrong.  Every president takes an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution as it was written, not as he may wish it to be.  Yet today, the president writes laws and rules that let him restrain personal liberty and kill with impunity, and Congress and the American people let him get away with it. Formally, we still have a Constitution. Functionally, it has utterly failed to restrain the government.  Ultimately, we have ourselves to blame for these killings and undeclared wars. Why do we repose the Constitution for safekeeping into the hands of those who subvert it? If a future president uses Mr. Bush’s lust, Mr. Obama’s logic and Mr. Biden’s hatred to kill Americans in America, then no one’s life, liberty or property will be secure.  • To learn more about Judge Andrew Napolitano, visit https://JudgeNap.com."

Baltimore Police fatally shoot man who they say pointed gun at officers Tuesday afternoon in Millhill,2023-11-07,2023-11-08T04:46:21Z,en,baltimoresun.com,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-baltimore-police-shooting-20231107-3fcapoa5rzhdref2e4bhd35f6q-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108044621id_/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-baltimore-police-shooting-20231107-3fcapoa5rzhdref2e4bhd35f6q-story.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108044621/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-md-baltimore-police-shooting-20231107-3fcapoa5rzhdref2e4bhd35f6q-story.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bikvbmV3cy9icy1tZC1iYWx0aW1vcmUtcG9saWNlLXNob290aW5nLTIwMjMxMTA3LTNmY2Fwb2E1cnpoZHJlZjJlNGJoZDM1ZjZxLXN0b3J5Lmh0bWw~,"Police fatally shot a man who they said pointed a gun at officers while fleeing in Southwest Baltimore, Police Commissioner Richard Worley said Tuesday afternoon. The man, who police said they have not identified yet, was pronounced dead at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. Two neighborhood residents who said they witnessed the shooting Tuesday said the victim was their brother Hunter Jessup. Worley said officers from the Southwest District Action Team were patrolling Brunswick Street in the Millhill neighborhood at 12:35 p.m. Tuesday when they tried to stop a man because they believed he was armed. “They saw something that made them believe he was armed,” Worley said. When asked for details about the stop, Worley said he did not want to call the neighborhood “a high-crime area,” but said there had been several shootings nearby and that officers were doing “proactive patrol.” The man fled onto the 2600 block of Wilkens Avenue, and officers chased him on foot, police said. After the man drew a gun, an officer tackled him onto a set of steps. The man turned and pointed his weapon at officers, and “multiple officers” then opened fire, after warning him to drop his weapon, Worley said. Officers rendered aid immediately after shooting the man, the commissioner said. He said police recovered a handgun with an extended magazine from the scene and said it wasn’t clear yet whether the man had fired at officers. An officer had “blood on his pants” and initially thought he had been shot but was not, Worley said. The officer was treated at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center and released. After an officer shot a 17-year-old in Southwest Baltimore’s Shipley Hill neighborhood in May, Baltimore Police declined to answer questions about what the characteristics of an armed person are and whether the department evaluates how often officers are incorrect in their suspicions. In response to that shooting, Baltimore defense attorney Natalie Finegar said the phrase armed person is police terminology created to justify stopping people on a “hunch,” which is not otherwise legal. A police spokesperson said the department is reviewing body camera footage from Tuesday’s shooting, and that it was too early in the investigation to say how many officers shot at the man or how many shots were fired. The Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland Office of the Attorney General, which investigates deadly interactions with police, was at the scene Tuesday, spokesperson Thomas Lester said. Speaking at the scene, Mayor Brandon Scott said: “We know that incidents like these really pull the heart out of the community. ... This again points to the bigger and broader issue about the flow of guns into our city and how we cannot have individuals just walking around with these weapons that can lead to incidents like today. It’s very unfortunate.” One of the witnesses, Kahlil Hardy, said the shooting occurred in front of his house. Hardy, 24, said he came to his door when he heard the shots and saw “at least three or four” officers fire at Jessup, who he said had just returned from a stint in prison. “That wasn’t his,” Hardy said of the gun police said they recovered. Police had placed 59 evidence markers at the scene. “What I’m trying to understand is how are there 50 shell casings?” Hardy said. “I’m going to cry, bro.” Jevelon Nolley, 24, said he and his brother Hunter were at the corner of Brunswick and St. Benedict streets when two officers in police vests pulled up in an unmarked car. ”They harass us 24/7,” Nolley said. “This is every day.” Nolley said police told them to lift their shirts to show they didn’t have a “bulge” from a weapon. He said they lifted their shirts, then asked police what probable cause they had to stop them. Nolley also said Jessup was unarmed. As officers questioned them, his brother took off running around the corner onto Wilkens, Nolley said. Police cordoned off a crime scene between Millington Avenue and Brunswick. “He’s seen some stuff where a police officer killed someone else in his life,” Nolley said. Nolley said police fired at Jessup as he ran away, estimating officers fired 15 to 16 shots, hitting him 10 times. His brother was taken to the hospital, he said. Nolley called Jessup a “stand-up guy,” and said he lives in the neighborhood where the shooting happened and has a baby on the way."

We’re talking about what happens next, if Issues 1 and 2 pass, on Today in Ohio. Editor Chris Quinn hosts our daily half-hour news podcast, with editorial board member Lisa Garvin, impact editor Leila Atassi and content director Laura Johnston. You’ve been sending Chris lots of thoughts and suggestions on our from-the-newsroom text account, in which he shares what we’re thinking about at cleveland.com. You can sign up here: https://joinsubtext.com/chrisquinn. Here’s what else we’re asking about today: It’s the day. Finally. Ohioans get their say on abortion and marijuana. It could be a day that sends yet another message to the statehouse about how out of touch lawmakers are with their constituents. So, Lisa, let’s start with when the polls close, and then let’s walk about when the abortion amendment and the marijuana law would take effect if they pass? The Cleveland Clinic soars in a recent ranking of patient safety in its hospitals while the other Cleveland systems did not. What are the rankings about, and what grade did the Clinic get? Speaking of the Clinic, we have more on the drones the system will use to deliver prescriptions starting 2025. How far can they go? How much can they actually carry? Were Halloween candy sales down? What’s behind the layoff announcement from Nestle in Solon? The Israel-Hamas war has college campuses in America awash in protests and accusations. But Oberlin College is actually under a federal investigation. What for? Why is Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir, seeking sanctions against Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Mike O’Malley, who was not the prosecutor who handled the case involving her son? As Donald Trump continues to surge in the polls, we keep seeing news of the damage he did on Jan. 6. Who’s the latest Ohioan going to prison for participating in the insurrection? Football fans across America know who the Kelce brothers are, and many know they bothed played in high school at Cleveland Heights. What did the brothers sign off on their alma mater doing to raise some money? Why Is Lennie Stover, a trails advocate, wearing the moniker of Don Quixote in his latest quest?

Because it’s a computer-generated transcript, it contains many errors and misspellings. Chris (00:01.146) When we got through issue one in August, today seemed miles away. And yet here we are election day, November 7th, something we’ll be talking about on Today in Ohio, the news podcast discussion from cleveland.com and the Plain Dealer. Like I said, it’s the day when Ohioans get their say on abortion and marijuana. It could be a day that sends yet another message to our state house about how out of touch the lawmakers are with the constituents. Lisa, let’s start with when the polls close because we want people to go vote. If you haven’t voted, please make time. Stop listening to this podcast. Go to your polling place, go vote. And then Lisa, let’s walk around when the abortion amendment and the marijuana would take effect if they pass. Lisa (00:48.487) Okay, yeah, you have until 7.30 p.m. today to vote. I’ll be doing that as soon as we’re done with this podcast. And as Chris said, please exercise your right to vote. This is a very important election for all Ohioans, no matter how you feel about the issues. So the Ohio Constitution states that citizens initiated constitutional amendments like issue one. and citizen-initiated statutes like issue two generally take effect 30 days after the election, so this would be December 7th. Issue one, the abortion amendment. There are several current abortion laws on the books that may violate the amendment immediately if it’s passed, but these laws must be overturned either in court or repealed by the legislature. Case Western Reserve University retired constitutional law professor, Jonathan Enton says that Clinics could feasibly start providing abortions on December 7th. And they could use the new constitutional language if passed as a defense, if they’re challenged by providing abortions. Now, let’s not forget there was a law signed in 2019, the fetal heartbeat law, that means that anything after six weeks is illegal, but that’s currently being challenged. And so the state argues that clinics have no standing to even bring this lawsuit against the fetal heartbeat law. but how the court decides on the fetal heartbeat law will inform the pro-choice legal strategy going forward. Chris (02:16.878) Although, let’s face it, if you try to enforce any of these laws after the voters, if they approve issue one, approve it, you go into court and you say, well, the Constitution protects me. I mean, I just cannot see process. Well, I can’t say that because we have lunatics in different powers, powerful positions in the state. So a prosecutor, despite the Constitution, could try to enforce the law. But let’s remind people, we have a constitutional amendment on the books in Ohio that prohibits gay marriage. And it’s Lisa (02:28.911) Mm-hmm. Chris (02:44.694) it’s useless, it’s gone because of what the Supreme Court did, but it’s still on the book. So even whether they repeal these laws or not, they’re unenforceable because you have the Constitution on your side. I do suspect though, Lisa, we’ll see a lot of wheedling that the anti-abortion forces, if this passes, will be looking for artificial loopholes to try and make it harder for people to exercise this right. Lisa (03:11.503) Yeah, the one thing I’ve learned through doing the podcast and being on the editorial board is that the Right to Life and Mike Ganodakis, its director, they are very determined, and I don’t think they’re going to go down without a fight. Chris (03:22.578) They’re determined to get rid of the majority rule. I mean, that’s what they’re trying to do, and they always have. On marijuana, the legislature could come into session in a week and start changing that. But depending on how big a margin it passes by, if it passes, there’s political danger in doing so. So we’ll have to see what happens. I do worry that if this passes today, if marijuana passes today, people are going to misinterpret it and think it’s completely legal right now, and they could be prosecuted for doing certain things before the law takes effect, before the election is actually certified. I mean, we have three weeks before the results tonight would even be certified. So. Lisa (04:06.391) Right. And, and that, you know, as far as issue two, you know, they were going to roll out this, you know, a change in statute kind of in phases. So if issue two does pass today, Ohioans can start to grow up to six plants per adult at home, up to 12 maximum per household. They could start doing that December 7th. And dispensaries, now with dispensaries, the state must issue retail permits to existing dispensaries and new ones within nine months. So the coalition to regulate marijuana like alcohol, they’re saying that retail sales for recreational marijuana is possible in as little as 10 months, but they’re really looking at like an August to December, 2024 timeframe. Chris (04:48.914) But here’s my question. I actually ordered hot pepper seeds this morning because I’m going to grow them again in the spring. I haven’t grown them in a few years. But I can’t order marijuana seeds from Burpee, right? So if people want to grow it, where would they even get the seeds? Lisa (05:02.967) Well, and I have some friends that grew some marijuana in their basement a couple years ago, and seeds were very hard to find. It was kind of like a black market thing. It was like someone told somebody and somebody told somebody else, and that’s how they got their seeds. Chris (05:17.146) And I don’t know that the, well, I don’t know, maybe in Michigan they sell the seeds, who knows? We’ll have to figure that out, because I imagine that there are some horticulturists that’ll be like, oh, I can grow marijuana now, I wanna play. We’ll see, all will be known at the end of today about whether recreational marijuana will be legal and whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the Ohio constitution. Please vote, democracy doesn’t work unless you exercise your right. listening to Today in Ohio. The Cleveland Clinic soars in a recent ranking of patient safety in its hospitals, while the other Cleveland systems did not. Laura, what are the rankings about and what grade did the clinic get? laura (06:00.47) These are rankings for patient safety, and it’s from a nonprofit called LeapFrog, and they want to increase patient safety in hospitals. So the clinic earned the most A grades for safety in Greater Cleveland. This is in the fall 2023 hospital safety grades that was released Monday morning. They got high marks for protecting patients for against hospital infections, ensuring effective communication from physicians and nurses, giving clear discharge information, and a bunch of other categories. So LeapFrog, Lisa (06:17.739) They got high marks for protecting patients for against hospital infections, ensuring effective communication with physicians and nurses, giving clear discharge information and a bunch of other categories. So we find FROG assigns letter grades to nearly 3,000 hospitals in the United States, and they want patients to know where to go to protect them from errors, injuries, accidents, infections. laura (06:30.03) Frog assigns letter grades to nearly 3,000 hospitals in the United States, and they want patients to know where to go to protect them from errors, injuries, accidents, infections, when they get a chance to pick a hospital. So not so great other news for other hospitals. SUMA Health, Akron Campus, Metro Health System, University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center, all earned C grades. And these are the first to reflect the hospital performance. Lisa (06:42.243) when they get a chance to pick a hospital. So not so great other news for other hospitals. Suma Health, Akron Campus, Metro Health System, University Hospital, Sleetlal Medical Center, all earn C grade. And these are the first to reflect the hospital performance after the peak of the COVID pandemic. So actually, across the country, rates of healthcare acquired infections improved post-pandemic. That’s good news. The patient experience is considered laura (06:58.47) after the peak of the COVID pandemic. So actually across the country, rates of healthcare acquired infections improved post pandemic, that’s good news, but patient experience continues to worsen and that’s a second year for that trend. Lisa (07:12.821) in the second year for that. Chris (07:15.07) The scariest thing in this story is the number of people who go into the hospital to get cured of something and die as a result. I think it was 200,000 people get things in hospitals, a lot of infections, and die. So these ratings are really important because the last thing you want to do if you go into a hospital is get something worse than what you’re in there for. In the past, people had largely looked at UH as the patient-friendly hospital and the clinic as the technically proficient hospital. Lisa (07:36.251) Give them feedback. laura (07:41.803) Mm-hmm. Lisa (07:42.299) learning at the Tech Machine Physician Hospital. But these ways, they can still count how you give instructions to people when they’re describing that, and how you handle it. But they can still count. So that’s one of the things. Chris (07:45.17) But this has changed. These ratings take into account how you give instructions to people when you’re discharging them and how you handle the patients. And the clinic just did really well. laura (07:57.866) Right, and this is not just the main campus where people come from all over. These are their smaller hospitals as well. All getting As were Fairview, Euclid, Lutheran, Marymount, South Point, Hillcrest, and Avon. So if I have to go to an ER, it’s gonna be Fairview or Avon, right? Like that’s where I would go. There were two B grades that the clinic got. That was Medina and Akron General, which were not originally clinic hospitals, right? But our clinic now. Lisa (07:58.683) And this is not just the main campus where people come from all over. These are their smaller hospitals as well. All getting A’s were Fairview, Euclid, Lutheran, Marymount, South Point, Hillcrest, and Avon. So if I have to go to an ER, it’s going to be Fairview or Avon, right? With dots to where I would go. There were two B grades that the clinic got. That was Medina and Akron General, which were not originally clinic hospitals, right? But are clinics now. UH Parma did earn an A grade. laura (08:25.098) UH Parma did earn an A grade, so if you go to Parma, good for you. There are B grades at TriPoint, Ahuja, and Lake West, but Elyria and Geauga locations got C grades. And just like we said, Metro Health. Metro Health is saying they are doing better, but these leapfrog grades generally lag 18 months behind current results. So... Lisa (08:28.477) good for you. There are B grades in Tri-Point, Cahooja, and Lake West, but Elyria and Geauga locations got D grades. And just like we said, Metro Health. Metro Health is saying they are doing better, but these lead prop grades generally lag 18 months behind. Yeah, but they’re all getting my homework right. Chris (08:42.822) Yeah, the dog ate my homework, right? I mean, come on. laura (08:47.662) Cause that’s from Erica Steed, who is the new MetroHealth CEO. And she has promised to increase patient safety. She’s made that a focus. So hopefully next year, we’re gonna see MetroHealth in this A category, but right now, no. Lisa (08:48.187) because that’s America Seed who is the new MetroHealth CEO. And she has promised to increase patient safety. She’s made that a focus. So hopefully next year we’re gonna see MetroHealth in this A category, but right now, no. Yeah, I think, I mean, we’re waiting for you to do rankings. And you aged in MetroPistons and the clinic did today. And that’s a good sign for the partner to get something. Chris (09:00.502) Yeah, I mean, these are new rankings and UH and Metro get a C and the clinic gets an A and that’s big time for the clinic. That’s something that they can really boast about. This is the serious stuff you care about when you go into a hospital. laura (09:14.85) Yeah, we’re right in the middle of the rankings for states, and we have been there for a while. 25% of Ohio hospitals earned A grades, so 26 in the nation. Lisa (09:15.355) Yeah, we’re right in the middle of the rankings for states. And we have been there for a while. 25% of Ohio hospitals are in eighth grade. So 26% in the main grade. You’re listening to Panay in Ohio. Speaking of the clinic, we have more on the drones. The system was used for the little construction started in 2025. It’s amazing. I believe it’s a real response to the systems that are being used in the United States. And we’re excited to see what the future holds for the system. Chris (09:25.19) You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Speaking of the clinic, we have more on the drones the system will use to deliver prescriptions starting in 2025. It’s amazing. Other readers have really responded. They hate this idea. They think we’ve become a society that demands instantaneous everything and we shouldn’t do it. Although if you have an acute illness, you do want to get your medicine quickly. Well, the video on this thing is fascinating. A reader sent it to us. So we did another story. How far can these drones go and how much can they actually carry? Leila (09:42.2) Huh. Leila (09:54.323) Yeah, Julie followed up on her reporting with this really interesting Q&A that tells us more about how these things will function. And here are some of the highlights. These can cruise along at 70 miles an hour. They can fly in a 10-mile radius or up to 24 miles one way while carrying a six to eight pound payload. As far as safety is concerned, they’re equipped with detect and avoid technology that would help the drone steer clear of obstacles that could pose a hazard. Lisa (10:08.495) and that’s a 10 for minus one way of appearing to six to eight pound payload. As far as safety is concerned, they’re quick to keep track. Leila (10:22.883) A flight operations team monitors each flight as well as weather and air traffic to make sure that it’s safe. And if a critical flight system were to malfunction, its backup would activate automatically and the drones have parachutes for emergency landings. Julie reported in her last story that the drones deploy a cable to deliver their packages. And it turns out that these are so precise in their deployment. Lisa (10:46.615) are so precise in their deployment that they can deliver in any complex space that’s as small as a two foot radius while hovering at 300 feet above their target. That is astonishing. Well, they’re not driving the prescription bad, but we’ve done it before. Leila (10:48.887) that they can deliver in any open space that’s as small as a two-foot radius while hovering at 300 feet above their target. That is astonishing. The drone Chris (11:00.55) Well, they’re not dropping a prescription bag like you get at the pharmacy. There’s a there’s a unit that comes down the cable. It’s pretty technical. And when you they have a 24 hour time lapse video of one of their delivery centers. And my gosh, they slingshot these things into the air. The planes get on this ramp and they fire them into the air. And it’s just one after another, after another, after another. It’s highly technical, technically complex. Leila (11:26.999) This is, it’s so interesting. I mean, they say the drones are really quiet. They’re quieter than passing cars and they can fly in just about any weather condition, extreme cold, wind, rain, snow. And as we suspected, Zipline does not deliver controlled substances or schedule C narcotics and recipients can track their delivery time in real time, which they say would cut back on lost packages or... Lisa (11:28.187) So interesting. I mean, they say the drones are really quiet. They’re quieter than passing cars. And they can fly in just about any weather conditions. They can hold really great stuff. And as we suspected, Timeline does not deliver controlled substances or schedule seed or products. And recipients can track their delivery time. Leila (11:53.323) packages that are intercepted by curious wildlife and stuff like that. But just amazing how accurate these are. I am very curious to see how this works in practice when it’s finally deployed here. Chris (12:08.602) Well, somebody had written and said, I worry about the noise from the base for these things. But there was a video blogger that did a whole takeout on this company. And on while he was recording, he had different things that were making sound. And these drones, you could not hear them. I mean, you could hear everything else, but you really couldn’t hear them. So they are quiet. It’s fascinating that they’re doing it. But man, I did hear from a lot of people that just think this is ridiculous. Leila (12:25.933) Really. Chris (12:37.714) that people have gotten too impatient and that you should go pick up your prescriptions like everybody else. Lisa (12:43.211) Well, I have this vision of somebody like sitting on their back porch with a rifle shooting down drones and taking the drugs. It doesn’t matter. I mean, you know, if you need diabetes drugs, maybe this drone has it. I’ll shoot it down and see. I don’t know. Chris (12:47.622) Ha ha ha. Leila (12:47.81) So. Chris (12:55.334) Yeah Leila (12:55.907) That’s a real crap shoot. I don’t know about that. You’re really taking a gamble. For this purpose, this really could be extremely helpful. I think using drones for Amazon and Walmart deliveries might be a little much, which they have been testing these in some of their markets in the last couple of years. Chris (13:19.118) If you have a mail order prescription you have to get every month or every 90 days, then getting that by mail is perfectly fine. But if you’ve been diagnosed with something acute, that the medicine, the faster you get it into you, the faster you’ll feel better, then getting it to you within 10 minutes is helpful. When you feel terrible, you want to get relief. And so I salute them for what they’re trying to do here to help people out. I can’t wait to watch this in action. It’s going to be interesting. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Lisa, we’re Halloween candy sales down. What’s behind the layoff announcement from Nestle in Solon? Lisa (13:55.915) And actually Nestle and Solon is Stouffer’s, so they don’t make candy there. They make frozen foods there. But Nestle filed a notice with the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services about 77 permanent layoffs at its Solon campus. These layoffs would begin December 31st and go through August of next year. These are mostly office jobs, although they didn’t really provide more details than that. In their statement, Nestle said that, you know, they’re trying to stay ahead of changing market and consumer trends, so make of that what you will. Solon is still an important hub for Nestle. It’s a 60 acre campus. There are 3000 employees there. You can see it if you’re driving on US 422, it’s the Stouffer plant right off of the. the freeway there. They do frozen and chilled foods there. And of course, Stouffer’s is Cleveland based. They were bought by Nestle in 1973. Chris (14:47.418) There seems to be a feeling in corporate America that next year we’re going to have a recession and all sorts of companies seem like they’re making plans for it. You start to wonder if it becomes a fait accompli, that by planning for it and taking these steps, you’re actually creating the recession that you’re predicting. Lisa (15:07.233) And employers across the way are starting to think twice about hiring and layoffs are starting to creep up a little bit. This is only 77 out of 3000 people, so maybe they’re just trying to streamline their operation. It’s hard to say with the few details they provided. Chris (15:22.574) Okay, you’re listening to Today in Ohio. The Israel Hamas war has college campuses in America awash in protests and accusations, but Oberlin College is actually under a federal investigation. Laura, what for? laura (15:36.97) a religion professor is accused of being anti-Semitic. So the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is examining the school, Oberlin, which is known for being incredibly liberal and not just a liberal arts college. It’s this 2019 complaint that alleged that Professor Mohammed Jafar Mahalati said that Israel is a quote, colonialist and an apartheid state. So according to this Office for Civil Rights, the college is being investigated on allegations of breaching Title VI that protects students from being harassed and discriminated because of their religion. So the college learned of this complaint on September 29th, and they say they abhor anti-Semitism and all forms of hate, discrimination, and harassment. And obviously, Oberlin has a reputation for being very accepting, and so this is probably just an anathema to what it stands for. Chris (16:30.99) Yeah, the college campuses really have erupted with quite a few protests. It’s getting a lot of attention. I just, to be actually under federal investigation seems unusual. laura (16:43.902) It is. He’s a presidential scholar in Islamic Studies and he’s on sabbatical this semester while this is going on. They put out a statement and they said, Professor Mahalati has stated he believes in the right of all people to exist in peace and endorse a two-state solution that would allow the people of Israel and Palestine, sorry, Palestine, I’m using the Ohio pronunciation, to peacefully coexist. So that statement obviously does not sound like anti-Semitism. So I don’t know what he originally said. Lisa (16:44.343) It is. He’s a presidential scholar in Islamic studies. And he’s on sabbatical. they put out a statement and they said Professor Mahalati has stated he believes in the right of all people to assist and endorse a two-state solution that will allow the people of Israel and Palestine sorry Palestine, I’m using the wrong pronunciation to be fully co-existed that statement obviously did not sound like antisemitism so I don’t know what you originally said or where this complaint came from Yelissabeta Katenan-Owayo Chris (17:04.24) Yeah. laura (17:12.554) or where this complaint came from students. Chris (17:16.314) You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Why is Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir, so upset with Cuyahoga County prosecutor, Mike O’Malley, who was not the prosecutor who handled the case involving her son? Leila (17:29.171) Samaria Rice says that when Mike O’Malley was running for county prosecutor against his predecessor Tim McGinty, he promised her and other activists that he would re-examine the case of her son’s fatal police shooting. At that time, McGinty had presented the case to a grand jury and the grand jury declined to bring charges against the two officers involved in that, Timothy Loman and Frank Garmback. And O’Malley had refused back then during his campaign to say whether he felt the officers should have been charged. But he definitely accused him again of mishandling the investigation. And that sentiment helped him win the election. Samaria Rice says he told her and others in private meetings that he would reopen the case and he never did. O’Malley says that’s not true. He says he always maintained that the case shouldn’t go back to a grand jury without new evidence. So Samaria Rice was among several people who talked at a news conference this week and called on prosecutors to reopen several past cases of people who were shot or... killed by police in Cuyahoga County and charges were never brought in those cases. Chris (18:33.454) I know Michael Myler pretty well. I’ve been talking to him since he was a city councilman. So it’s more than a quarter century. And we talked to him quite a bit when he was running and he was very clear that he would not reopen this case without new evidence. They had a tour of board talk to him or reporters talk to him. So I’m surprised to hear she’s saying that he had privately said he would because we drilled them about it. We were all over them. Like, what do you mean? You know, you don’t like what McGinty did, but you’re not committing to doing anything new. And he He would say, look, it’s done. If somebody brings me new evidence, I will of course consider it. So I’m not sure where this is coming from. Leila (19:09.311) Yeah, that’s true. I mean, we can’t say what O’Malley promised her behind closed doors. I mean, if that, who knows? But publicly, he definitely managed to walk the tightrope of criticizing McGinty’s handling of it while never committing to a real position on this case. And in doing that, don’t you think he telegraphed to the public that he would have handled it differently? And for a lot of people, that meant that he would have sought justice for Tamir. Lisa (19:09.876) I’m not sure, but we can’t say what it is. All this is going to be very confusing. I just don’t know. Thank you. Chris (19:32.698) Well, no, he did come in and completely change the policy. What he did, and we questioned it, is he put all investigations of police shootings with the attorney general. He said, I feel I have a conflict because my office works with police. I don’t feel I should be investigating people that I work with. And the attorney general does it all. We questioned it because we said, we elect you. You’re the guy. that deals with crimes in Cuyahoga County. And by putting this responsibility elsewhere, that you’re not accountable for it, but he felt strongly about it. And ever since, that’s what’s happened. So I think he did change things when he came in and say, this shouldn’t have been handled by McGinty, it should have been handled by an outsider. Leila (20:22.463) Okay. I mean, that’s true. But it was certainly a politically expedient way to manage that controversy that helped him get elected. I don’t know. I mean, of course, like I said, we can’t... Who knows what kind of conversation Samaria Rice is referring to here. But clearly he got elected because he said McGinty’s handling of this was improper. Chris (20:46.878) Okay, you’re listening to Today in Ohio. As Donald Trump continues to surge in the polls, we keep seeing news of the damage he did on January 6th. It’s been a drumbeat of people getting convicted. Lisa, who’s the latest Ohioan going to prison for participating in Donald Trump’s insurrection? Lisa (21:04.326) He is 33 year old Michael Lockwood of Trumbull County. He received a one year prison sentence in federal prison, a $2,000 restitution payment, and he will have to be supervised for three years after he is released from prison. pled guilty in July to his role in a scuffle with Capitol Police on January 6th of 2021 at a Stop the Steal rally. Lockwood never did enter the Capitol building, but what happened was he resisted officers orders for him to leave the area. A fella nearby tried to help Lockwood by hitting officers with a flagpole, and when the officers turned their attention to the flagpole guy, um... One of them pulled out a police baton, which Lockwood wrestled away from the officer and then ran off. He later bragged about this and he sent photos to a friend of his little souvenir from the riot. He was ID’d via online video, Facebook, and facial recognition, and apparently his grandma fingered him as well. His attorney Samuel Moore says Lockwood was not a long-term partisan zealot. He never intended to harm officers and he has regret and sympathy. for officers who went through physical and emotional trauma on that day. Prosecutors wanted two years and three months in prison. The defense wanted just home detention or six months maximum in prison. Chris (22:25.654) He joins the ranks of the dumbest criminals you’ve ever seen. People who break the law and then openly publicize that they broke the law. These are the kind of people Trump attracts. Morons who break the law and then say, look at me, look at me, police, I broke the law. So of course he’s going to prison. What an idiot. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Football fans across America know who the Kelsey brothers are and many know they both played in high school at Cleveland Heights High. What did the brothers sign off on for their alma mater to raise some money, Laura? laura (23:00.47) Row back jerseys, number 48 for Jason, number one for Travis. As far as I know, there is no Swift jersey in the mix, but they have youth sizes, a men’s cut, and a woman’s cut, which is perfect for any Swifties in your life. And that’s from Heights Athletic Boosters co-founder Chrissy Dietrich Gallagher. There’s a separate fundraiser with the Heights Schools Foundation from their mom Donna, who has her own t-shirt fundraiser. But this was the idea of the boosters, along with high school teacher Mark Saks. who knows the Kelsey Brothers well enough to call them and by the end of the day, had their okay to sell these jerseys, you can get them through November 14th as the last day you can place your order and then pick them up December 5th. They run from 50 to $55. And my guess is these are gonna be really popular Christmas or holiday presents for anybody in the Cleveland area. Chris (23:55.27) How rare is this? Were people able to buy LeBron James high school jersey as a throwback too? Is this something that athletes do now? They help their high schools raise money by letting them sell their high school jerseys? laura (24:02.946) That’s a- laura (24:08.566) That’s a very good question. I have never seen, just running around Akron, a lot of kids wearing a Saint V 23 jersey, but hey, Saint V could do it now too. There’s no expiration date on this idea. It sounds like a great one. I mean, it’s not overly expensive for a gift for someone. And the Boosters is a fairly new, it’s the brainchild of four Cleveland Heights, University Heights, school district parents, and they. Lisa (24:16.829) But hey, we could do it now too. There’s no expiration date on this idea. It sounds like a great one. I mean, it’s not overly expensive or a gift for someone. And the Booster is fairly new. It’s the breakout of four Cleveland High schoolers. They have two different parents, and they want to address the... laura (24:34.89) want to address the needs they see in various school sports. So they got the senior banners for their fall sports student athletes up around the campus at the football field and where else they play, which is great. A lot of schools do that. But they raised money so the kids and their families didn’t have to pay for it. And they want to do bigger capital funding projects like a new scoreboard at Roxborough and more bleachers at the high school baseball field because apparently it’s tough to see there. So it’s a great cause. It’s a good idea. And I’m glad that Kelsey Brothers are on board. Lisa (24:36.207) They see it in various reports. They got the senior banners for their fall sports student athletes up around the campus, at the football field, and where else they play, which is great. A lot of schools do that. But they raise money so the kids and their families didn’t have to pay for it. And they want to do bigger capital funding projects. They’re getting scoreboard at Roxborough and more features at the high school baseball field, because apparently it’s tough to see there. So it’s a great cause. It’s a good idea. And I’m glad the Kelsey brothers are on board. Chris (25:05.414) It was nice that they did that. They didn’t have to sign off and it was nice that they’re supporting their high school. Lisa (25:06.241) they didn’t have to sign off. Right, they’re not getting a commission on this. It’s all going to the pool. It wasn’t until today in Ohio. Why don’t we still build a field after this, bring the monitor up next to the building, so we can press it. laura (25:09.374) Right, they’re not getting a commission on this. This is all going to the schools. Chris (25:13.298) You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Why is Lenny Stover, a trails advocate wearing the moniker of Don Quixote in his latest quest, Layla? Leila (25:22.683) Steve Litt brings us the story of Lenny Stover. He’s a longtime civic volunteer and a trails advocate who, much like Don Quixote, is a visionary who has really held onto a dream. And in Stover’s case, that dream is of seeing the Cleveland Metro Park’s Red Line Greenway extended from the city’s west side to downtown across the viaduct. This two-mile greenway was completed in 2021 along the Red Line tracks west of the river, but it now ends several hundred feet shy. of where the viaduct rises to cross over the water. There’s a fence that blocks the way. Trail users have to go downhill to this curving path that cuts under the concrete arches of the viaduct. And that trail leads to Franklin Avenue, the Lakeland Trail, and the future Irish town, Bend Park, that’s under construction now. And everyone loves the greenway, but Stover doesn’t think it’s finished. Stover now wants to see the greenway extended another Lisa (26:04.731) And that trail leads to Franklin Avenue, the Lakeland Trail, and the future Irish trail, Ben Park, that’s under construction. Everyone loves the greenway, but Stoddard doesn’t think it’s finished. Stoddard now wants to see the high-extended another 2,200 feet elevated RTA viaduct across the river from Ohio City to the northwest corner of town city center. And this is an idea that’s similar to that of New York’s Highland, which is converted, Leila (26:19.499) on the elevated RTA viaduct across the river from Ohio City to the northwest corner of Tower City Center. This is an idea that’s similar to that of New York’s High Line, which is a converted and unused elevated rail line in the lower west side of Manhattan into this park that attracts tons of visitors and has really spurred a real estate boom in New York. Lisa (26:34.705) in the unused elevated rail lines below this item. And it happens in this park that attracts tons of visitors and is really spurred of real estate in New York. Specifically, in the park, Leila (26:47.259) India birdsong Terry of RTA told him to go ahead and raise $100,000 for a feasibility study and she’ll be ready to hear the results. And Grace Galucci of NOACA, which oversees all the federal spending and transportation projects in our region, said she’s interested too. She’ll listen when he has something to offer. But I just thought what makes this such a great story is Stover himself, this retired investment advisor and an independent contractor who’s just had this project in his sights for decades. and is fighting for it all on his own. He’s even spent several thousand dollars of his own money to develop a new promotional video for this project. Chris (27:27.258) I just hope that if we get there that it’s funded with private donations. We have a lot of expensive needs in our region. We carried a letter to the editor today which is saying, hey, how can we be talking about all this lakefront development when we have all these needs that we can’t afford? And it’s a good point. We don’t have enough money for the crises that we face in this region. And we keep coming up with these recreational ideas saying, oh, wouldn’t this be great? And yeah, it would be great. Leila (27:44.598) is. Chris (27:56.038) But we don’t have any money. Leila (27:57.507) That’s true. Yeah, the reader is absolutely right. But it is interesting though to have someone like this, just someone who’s so obsessed with seeing improvement in their city that they just never give up. We need more people like that, I think, and then perhaps the private investment will come. Chris (28:01.967) Yeah, we... Chris (28:18.754) Yeah, I love the ideas. It’s just, we need a jail, we need a justice center, we need to deal with problems involving youth and we just don’t have any more money. We’re taxed to death as it is. So how do you pay for it all? You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Again, please go vote. Thanks Lisa, thanks Leila, thanks Laura. Thanks to everybody who listens. We’ll be back Wednesday talking about the election results from your voting. Lisa (28:34.619) Thank you for listening to Sinead Ohio. Again, please go vote. Thanks for your attention. Thanks to everyone who listened. We’ll be back Wednesday talking about the election results."
"Man killed after pointing gun at Baltimore police, officials say",2023-11-07,2023-11-08T02:30:22Z,en,startribune.com,https://www.startribune.com/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say/600317979/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108023022id_/https://www.startribune.com/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say/600317979/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108023022/https://www.startribune.com/man-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-baltimore-police-officials-say/600317979/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLHN0YXJ0cmlidW5lKS9tYW4ta2lsbGVkLWFmdGVyLXBvaW50aW5nLWd1bi1hdC1iYWx0aW1vcmUtcG9saWNlLW9mZmljaWFscy1zYXkvNjAwMzE3OTc5,"BALTIMORE â Baltimore police officers shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them following a foot pursuit Tuesday afternoon, officials said. Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed. Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said. One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasn't the case, Worley said. Officials haven't determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also haven't determined whether the armed man fired his handgun. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasn't been released. The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Department's specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they don't wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said. The teams drew scrutiny earlier this year after a police shooting that unfolded under similar circumstances and left a teen in critical condition â less than a mile from the scene of Tuesday's shooting. In that case, too, officers tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was carrying a gun. He ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. In this case as in the previous shooting, Worley defended the officers' actions. He said they were conducting ''proactive patrols'' aimed at preventing violence. He also said they yelled at the man multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire. ''This is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,'' Worley said during a news conference at the scene. ''We don't know what he was up to with that weapon.'' Department policy says officers are allowed to use deadly force when they believe it's ''immediately necessary'' to protect another officer or civilian from ''imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.'' In the case of a fleeing suspect, officers can use deadly force to prevent the person from escaping under certain circumstances. ''While we are very early in this investigation, we know that incidents like this really pull the heart out of the community,'' said Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, thanking city police officers for what they do. But praise for the city's police department has been hard to come by in recent years. The agency has implemented significant reform measures under a federal consent decree established in 2017 that mandates a series of court-ordered changes to eliminate unconstitutional policing practices and improve community trust. The agreement was reached after the U.S. Justice Department discovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing. The DOJ investigation was launched after Freddie Gray's 2015 death from spinal injuries in Baltimore police custody.

Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks. George Walker IV/AP  NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Nashville mayor's office called on the city's legal team Monday to investigate the possible unauthorized release of the writings of the shooter who indiscriminately opened fire at the private Nashville school in March, killing three children and three adults before being fatally shot by police.  Mayor Freddie O'Connell issued the statement shortly after conservative radio host Steven Crowder released what he said were three images of Audrey Hale's writings from the day of the shooting.  Metro Nashville Police Department said Monday the images were not “MNPD crime scene images” and that it was working with Nashville's legal department in the investigation.  Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation declined to confirm the authentication.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  Authorities have not disclosed any of Hale's journals or writings that were collected after the March 27 shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings.  MNPD initially said they would release the documents, but only after an investigation was officially closed — which could have taken months. In response, groups seeking the documents filed a lawsuit arguing that since the suspect was dead, the records should be immediately released.  Police then reversed course, saying that because of the lawsuits they would await the direction of the court on whether to release Hale’s writings.  That lawsuit is ongoing.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  “I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving,"" O’Connell said.  Wally Dietz, Nashville's law director, confirmed in a statement Monday that he was launching the investigation, but said he could not immediately confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents due to the limited information surrounding the “possible leak.""  The Associated Press also has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents released Monday. The AP is one of several groups that have requested the writings but is not involved in the lawsuit to obtain them.  Attorneys representing families with the Covenant School have repeatedly said they have not seen Hale's writings.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  Brent Leatherwood, whose three children attend Covenant School, challenged Crowder and anyone who would amplify the images online to “just be a human for once,” and stop seeking clicks or platform building. Talking to reporters, Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks.  “How many people have to be killed in a senseless way so that you can get clicks?” he said.  Leatherwood said he received phone calls from parents today upset and worried to even look online at the images: “The damage done today is already significant, and I’m afraid it’s only going to grow.”  In May, a chancery court judge ruled that a group of more than 100 Covenant families could intervene in the case. The families say they do not want the police records to be made public, arguing the records will only cause more pain and possibly spark copycats.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  An appeals court is now weighing whether that judge acted within the law.  Police have said Hale had been planning the massacre for months. Hale fired 152 rounds during the attack before being killed by police. Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder,” police said. However, authorities haven’t disclosed a link between that care and the shooting.  The Covenant case is further complicated by the fact that Hale, who was assigned female at birth, seems to have begun identifying as a transgender man – prompting right-wing commentators, politicians and other figures to share false claims of a rise in transgender mass shooters and to suggest that the fight for trans rights is radicalizing people.  Authorities’ refusal to release Hale’s writings has fueled further speculation and conspiracy theories about what they might reveal about Hale’s motive or influences.

An officer suffered minor injuries while the man was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Lea Skene/AP  BALTIMORE (AP) — Baltimore police officers shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them following a foot pursuit Tuesday afternoon, officials said.  Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed.  Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said.  One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasn’t the case, Worley said.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  Officials haven’t determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also haven’t determined whether the armed man fired his handgun.  The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasn’t been released.  The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Department’s specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they don’t wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said.  The teams drew scrutiny earlier this year after a police shooting that unfolded under similar circumstances and left a teen in critical condition — less than a mile from the scene of Tuesday’s shooting. In that case, too, officers tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was carrying a gun. He ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  In this case as in the previous shooting, Worley defended the officers’ actions. He said they were conducting “proactive patrols” aimed at preventing violence. He also said they yelled at the man multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire.  “This is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,” Worley said during a news conference at the scene. “We don’t know what he was up to with that weapon.”  Department policy says officers are allowed to use deadly force when they believe it’s “immediately necessary” to protect another officer or civilian from “imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.” In the case of a fleeing suspect, officers can use deadly force to prevent the person from escaping under certain circumstances.  “While we are very early in this investigation, we know that incidents like this really pull the heart out of the community,” said Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, thanking city police officers for what they do.  Advertisement Article continues below this ad  But praise for the city’s police department has been hard to come by in recent years. The agency has implemented significant reform measures under a federal consent decree established in 2017 that mandates a series of court-ordered changes to eliminate unconstitutional policing practices and improve community trust. The agreement was reached after the U.S. Justice Department discovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing.  The DOJ investigation was launched after Freddie Gray’s 2015 death from spinal injuries in Baltimore police custody. Not long after the consent decree was announced, the Gun Trace Task Force scandal revealed abuse and corruption inside an elite plainclothes unit."
Are Vallejo officers using force more often than they used to?,2023-11-07,2023-11-08T02:00:54Z,en,mercurynews.com,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/07/are-vallejo-officers-using-force-more-often-than-they-used-to/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108020054id_/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/07/are-vallejo-officers-using-force-more-often-than-they-used-to/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231108020054/https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/07/are-vallejo-officers-using-force-more-often-than-they-used-to/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG1lcmN1cnluZXdzKS8yMDIzLzExLzA3L2FyZS12YWxsZWpvLW9mZmljZXJzLXVzaW5nLWZvcmNlLW1vcmUtb2Z0ZW4tdGhhbi10aGV5LXVzZWQtdG8~,"The Vallejo Police Department has spent the past several years working to ensure its officers resort to using force only when strictly necessary.  But the agency’s new data tracking system – which aims to capture more thorough information on use-of-force arrests – makes it impossible to tell whether this effort has been successful.  Police data released last month appears to show a massive increase in Vallejo officers using weapons like batons, Tasers and projectile launchers to arrest people.  Reported use-of-force incidents soared from 38 in all of 2022 to 198 as of the end of September – a more than fivefold increase. Reported control holds skyrocketed from two in 2022 to 92 in the first nine months of 2023. The number of takedowns that police reported likewise jumped from 16 to 91.  The numbers appear to fly in the face of the California Department of Justice’s attempts to curb excessive force in a police department infamous for its strained and sometimes violent relationship with its community.  In a Monday press release, Vallejo police clarified what had happened.  Even though the VPD displayed its 2023 data side by side with data from 2022, changes in how the agency measures use-of-force incidents mean that comparing the two years is difficult. For instance, while the previous numbers only included control holds where the suspect made a complaint about pain or injury, the current numbers list all control holds regardless of their outcome.  “Due to this significant change in UOF criteria and data collection metrics, the department is informing the public that a month-to-month or year-to-year comparison using two separate processes and criteria can be confusing,” the VPD said. “As we continue to collect this data in this manner, a more direct comparison can be made using 2023 data compared to 2024 data.”  Related Articles Crime and Public Safety | Excessive force lawsuit from 2020 San Jose George Floyd protests cleared for trial  Excessive force lawsuit from 2020 San Jose George Floyd protests cleared for trial Crime and Public Safety | Ex-California cop gets 27 years for kidnapping, other crimes committed while working as bail bondsman  Ex-California cop gets 27 years for kidnapping, other crimes committed while working as bail bondsman Crime and Public Safety | Australian officer charged after he tasered woman, 95, in rest home  Australian officer charged after he tasered woman, 95, in rest home Crime and Public Safety | California police officer under investigation after use of force caught on video  California police officer under investigation after use of force caught on video Crime and Public Safety | Road rage spree alleged against ex-San Jose cop known for indecent exposure scandal As of last year, according to police, Vallejo officers were using force much less frequently than they used to. Reported use-of-force incidents decreased by 62% between 2020, when the DOJ began oversight of Vallejo police, and 2022.  A substantial portion of the police force quit, retired or was fired during that period.  While the current data reveals little, outrage over Vallejo officers’ reliance on force has dominated many recent public meetings.  Activists swamped Vallejo City Hall in September to protest the return of Det. Jarrett Tonn, who killed 22-year-old Sean Monterrosa while he was unarmed and reportedly on his knees in 2020. The Solano County chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is currently weighing options to hold Vallejo officers accountable for past misconduct concerning uses of force and has hosted two lively town hall meetings on the topic in recent months.  Additionally, the California DOJ last month accused Vallejo officers of violating the U.S. Constitution by “using unreasonable force.”  Vallejo’s first officer-involved shooting since Monterrosa’s death also took place this June during a burglary at a Springs Road gas station."

Police Commissioner Richard Worley said officers were patrolling an area in southwest Baltimore known for frequent gun violence when they encountered a man who they believed to be armed. Officers tried to stop the man and he fled, Worley said. He said that during the chase, the man drew a weapon and an officer tried to tackle him. Officers opened fire when the man pointed his gun at them, Worley said. One officer received minor injuries. Officials initially thought the officer had been shot because he had blood on his pants, but they later determined that wasnât the case, Worley said. Officials havenât determined how many officers pulled the trigger. They also havenât determined whether the armed man fired his handgun. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, Worley said. His identity hasnât been released. The officers involved are members of a so-called District Action Team, one of the Baltimore Police Departmentâs specialized units that focuses on proactive patrols and other measures in areas of Baltimore most plagued by violence. While they donât wear traditional uniforms, their vests clearly identify them as police, Worley said. The teams drew scrutiny earlier this year after a police shooting that unfolded under similar circumstances and left a teen in critical condition â less than a mile from the scene of Tuesdayâs shooting. In that case, too, officers tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was carrying a gun. He ran away, holding a gun in one hand, and an officer shot him from behind. In this case as in the previous shooting, Worley defended the officersâ actions. He said they were conducting âproactive patrolsâ aimed at preventing violence. He also said they yelled at the man multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire. âThis is another example of our officers doing a great job of apprehending an individual who was armed,â Worley said during a news conference at the scene. âWe donât know what he was up to with that weapon.â Department policy says officers are allowed to use deadly force when they believe itâs âimmediately necessaryâ to protect another officer or civilian from âimminent danger of death or serious physical injury.â In the case of a fleeing suspect, officers can use deadly force to prevent the person from escaping under certain circumstances. âWhile we are very early in this investigation, we know that incidents like this really pull the heart out of the community,â said Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, thanking city police officers for what they do. But praise for the cityâs police department has been hard to come by in recent years. The agency has implemented significant reform measures under a federal consent decree established in 2017 that mandates a series of court-ordered changes to eliminate unconstitutional policing practices and improve community trust. The agreement was reached after the U.S. Justice Department discovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing. The DOJ investigation was launched after Freddie Grayâs 2015 death from spinal injuries in Baltimore police custody. Not long after the consent decree was announced, the Gun Trace Task Force scandal revealed abuse and corruption inside an elite plainclothes unit. An assessment earlier this year found officers are significantly less likely to use force against members of the public than they were before the consent decree was put in place.

An unknown number of officers were in the area of 7th and Grayson streets around 5:25 a.m. investigating a suspected vehicle burglary in progress when they encountered three adult suspects, police said while speaking to reporters.  In a statement Monday night, police said an officer detained one of the suspects as the other two fled in a vehicle. The vehicle crashed into a patrol car and drove toward the officer and the detained suspect, according to police. That’s when officers opened fire.  The driver was struck at least once. He received medical care at the scene and was taken to Highland Hospital in Oakland, where he died of his injuries, police said. His identity was not released.  The other suspects – a 37-year-old Novato man and a 30-year-old Oakland woman – were arrested on suspicion of burglary, vehicle theft and being in possession of a stolen vehicle, according to police.  No officers were injured.  At the scene, a Ford truck was spotted next to a police vehicle with at least one bullet hole in the driver’s side window.  The Berkeley Police Department Homicide Division and Internal Affairs Bureau are investigating the fatal shooting. Per standard protocol, the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office is conducting a concurrent probe.  In September, five Berkeley officers fatally shot 24-year-old Lamar Walker after he killed the mother of his 7-year-old child, before an apparent attempt to take his own life at the Toyota of Berkeley Service Center in just over the city border in Albany. When police found him, he allegedly pointed a revolver at officers before they opened fire."

Leaked images of writings of the shooter who indiscriminately opened fire at the private Nashville school in March were released by a media outlet earlier in the day. Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks. (AP Photo/George Walker IV)  The Nashville mayor’s office called on the city’s legal team Monday to investigate the possible unauthorized release of the writings of the shooter who indiscriminately opened fire at the private Nashville school in March, killing three children and three adults before being fatally shot by police.  Mayor Freddie O’Connell issued the statement shortly after conservative radio host Steven Crowder released what he said were three images of Audrey Hale’s writings from the day of the shooting.  Metro Nashville Police Department said Monday the images were not “MNPD crime scene images” and that it was working with Nashville’s legal department in the investigation.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation declined to confirm the authentication.  Authorities have not disclosed any of Hale’s journals or writings that were collected after the March 27 shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings.  MNPD initially said they would release the documents, but only after an investigation was officially closed — which could have taken months. In response, groups seeking the documents filed a lawsuit arguing that since the suspect was dead, the records should be immediately released.  Police then reversed course, saying that because of the lawsuits they would await the direction of the court on whether to release Hale’s writings.  That lawsuit is ongoing.  “I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving,” O’Connell said.  Wally Dietz, Nashville’s law director, confirmed in a statement Monday that he was launching the investigation, but said he could not immediately confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents due to the limited information surrounding the “possible leak.”  The Associated Press also has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents released Monday. The AP is one of several groups that have requested the writings but is not involved in the lawsuit to obtain them.  Attorneys representing families with the Covenant School have repeatedly said they have not seen Hale’s writings.  Brent Leatherwood, whose three children attend Covenant School, challenged Crowder and anyone who would amplify the images online to “just be a human for once,” and stop seeking clicks or platform building. Talking to reporters, Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks.  “How many people have to be killed in a senseless way so that you can get clicks?” he said.  Leatherwood said he received phone calls from parents today upset and worried to even look online at the images: “The damage done today is already significant, and I’m afraid it’s only going to grow.”  In May, a chancery court judge ruled that a group of more than 100 Covenant families could intervene in the case. The families say they do not want the police records to be made public, arguing the records will only cause more pain and possibly spark copycats.  An appeals court is now weighing whether that judge acted within the law.  Police have said Hale had been planning the massacre for months. Hale fired 152 rounds during the attack before being killed by police. Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder,” police said. However, authorities haven’t disclosed a link between that care and the shooting.  The Covenant case is further complicated by the fact that Hale, who was assigned female at birth, seems to have begun identifying as a transgender man – prompting right-wing commentators, politicians and other figures to share false claims of a rise in transgender mass shooters and to suggest that the fight for trans rights is radicalizing people.  Authorities’ refusal to release Hale’s writings has fueled further speculation and conspiracy theories about what they might reveal about Hale’s motive or influences.  The three children who were killed in the shooting were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. The three adults were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, custodian Mike Hill, 61, and 61-year-old substitute teacher Cynthia Peak. ___  Associated Press writer Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis, Tennessee."

Thomas Nock’s death early Sunday morning came almost 24 hours after he exchanged gunfire with North Olmsted officers, according to police and the Cuyahoga County medical examiner’s office.  A police officer was also shot. He was treated and released from the hospital.  The shooting happened about 1:45 a.m. Saturday in the area of Alden and Douglas drives, police said.  A woman called police and said a man had approached her and said someone was trying to kill his uncle. The man gave the woman an address for a residence on Alden Drive and took off on foot, police said.  Officers arrived in the area of Alden Drive and found Nock, who had a gun, police said. Shots were fired between him and the officers, police said. It’s unclear who fired first.  The officer was struck twice and taken to St. John Westshore Hospital, where he was later released.  Nock was shot and taken to Fairview Hospital. He suffered multiple gunshot wounds, police said.  He died at the hospital just before 1 a.m. Sunday, the medical examiner’s office said.  Police went to the address given to the woman. The house was engulfed in flames, and firefighters from Westlake, Fairview Park, Rocky River, Olmsted Township, North Ridgeville and Bay Village responded to assist, police said.  A press conference with North Olmsted Police is planned for Monday afternoon."

(AP) — The Nashville mayor’s office called on the city’s legal team Monday to investigate the possible unauthorized release of the writings of the shooter who indiscriminately opened fire at the private Nashville school in March, killing three children and three adults before being fatally shot by police. Mayor Freddie O’Connell issued the statement shortly after conservative radio host Steven Crowder released what he said were three images of Audrey Hale’s writings from the day of the shooting. Metro Nashville Police Department said Monday the images were not “MNPD crime scene images” and that it was working with Nashville’s legal department in the investigation. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation declined to confirm the authentication. Authorities have not disclosed any of Hale’s journals or writings that were collected after the March 27 shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. MNPD initially said they would release the documents, but only after an investigation was officially closed — which could have taken months. In response, groups seeking the documents filed a lawsuit arguing that since the suspect was dead, the records should be immediately released. Police then reversed course, saying that because of the lawsuits they would await the direction of the court on whether to release Hale’s writings. That lawsuit is ongoing. “I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving,” O’Connell said. Wally Dietz, Nashville’s law director, confirmed in a statement Monday that he was launching the investigation, but said he could not immediately confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents due to the limited information surrounding the “possible leak.” The Associated Press also has not confirmed the authenticity of the documents released Monday. The AP is one of several groups that have requested the writings but is not involved in the lawsuit to obtain them. Attorneys representing families with the Covenant School have repeatedly said they have not seen Hale’s writings. Brent Leatherwood, whose three children attend Covenant School, challenged Crowder and anyone who would amplify the images online to “just be a human for once,” and stop seeking clicks or platform building. Talking to reporters, Leatherwood said the writings have the ability to inspire further attacks. “How many people have to be killed in a senseless way so that you can get clicks?” he said. Leatherwood said he received phone calls from parents today upset and worried to even look online at the images: “The damage done today is already significant, and I’m afraid it’s only going to grow.” In May, a chancery court judge ruled that a group of more than 100 Covenant families could intervene in the case. The families say they do not want the police records to be made public, arguing the records will only cause more pain and possibly spark copycats. An appeals court is now weighing whether that judge acted within the law. Police have said Hale had been planning the massacre for months. Hale fired 152 rounds during the attack before being killed by police. Hale was under a doctor’s care for an undisclosed “emotional disorder,” police said. However, authorities haven’t disclosed a link between that care and the shooting. The Covenant case is further complicated by the fact that Hale, who was assigned female at birth, seems to have begun identifying as a transgender man – prompting right-wing commentators, politicians and other figures to share false claims of a rise in transgender mass shooters and to suggest that the fight for trans rights is radicalizing people. Authorities’ refusal to release Hale’s writings has fueled further speculation and conspiracy theories about what they might reveal about Hale’s motive or influences. The three children who were killed in the shooting were Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney.

October homicide total is 8 in Pulaski County,2023-11-05,2023-11-07T06:30:29Z,en,arkansasonline.com,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/nov/05/october-homicide-total-is-8-in-county/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107063029id_/https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/nov/05/october-homicide-total-is-8-in-county/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231107063029/https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2023/nov/05/october-homicide-total-is-8-in-county/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lKS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvbm92LzA1L29jdG9iZXItaG9taWNpZGUtdG90YWwtaXMtOC1pbi1jb3VudHk~,"Police in Pulaski County investigated eight homicides in October, data shows, marking a death toll that was twice the one set in September, but less than four other months so far this year.  Little Rock police investigated seven of the killings, while North Little Rock police investigated one.  The number of homicides reported last month matched the number reported in March, but was less than the nine reported in January, the 10 reported in August and the 11 reported in both May and July. October's death toll was higher than the seven killings in June, the six in April, the four in September and the three in February.  As of Saturday, law enforcement in the county had investigated 78 slayings. By that date last year, there had been 102 killings reported in Pulaski County, and 83 by that date in 2021. That represented a roughly 23% drop from 2022 and about a 6% drop from 2021.  The seven killings Little Rock police investigated last month represented a drop from the nine reported in October 2022, but an increase from that month in previous years. Other than 2022, it was the first time seven killings had been reported in the city in October since 2002.  In North Little Rock, the single killing reported last month was higher than last October, but the same as October 2021. The last time more than one killing has been reported in October in North Little Rock was 2016, when two people were slain.  All but one of the homicide victims in October were men or boys. As of Saturday, 65, or about 83%, of homicide victims were male.  All of the people killed in October were Black. Black people accounted for 63, or about 82%, of homicide victims so far in 2023 whose race had been identified. Eleven of the slain, or about 14%, were white, and three, or about 4%, were Hispanic. One victim's race and age had not been released by Saturday.  Black people in Pulaski County are killed at a disproportionate rate when compared to their portion of the population. U.S. Census Bureau data puts the Black portion of the population at 41% in Little Rock, 44% in North Little Rock and about 39% in the county.  The average age of a homicide victim in October was about 27 years old, lower than the average so far this year of about 31. Two of the people killed in October were younger than 18. So far this year, 13 victims were under 18 years of age, and four of those were infants.  Of the seven victims in October whose cause of death was released by authorities, all died of gunshot wounds. North Little Rock police refused to release the cause of death in their single homicide case last month, saying it was relevant to the investigation.  As of Saturday, authorities had not released a cause of death in five cases, but of the remaining 73 killings, 62, or about 85%, were the result of gun violence.  By Saturday, Little Rock police had investigated 50 killings across 45 separate incidents, with some of the incidents resulting in multiple deaths. That was a roughly 29% decrease from that pointlast year, when officers had investigated 71 killings across 66 incidents. It was a roughly 9% decrease from Nov. 1, 2021, when 55 people had been killed across the capital city in 54 incidents.  North Little Rock had investigated 18 homicides by Saturday, a roughly 12% increase from the 16 killings reported in the city by that date in 2022, but a 5% drop from the 19 killings reported in North Little Rock by Nov. 1, 2021.  Pulaski County deputies did not report any homicides in October, but had logged four killings as of Saturday. That was about 55% less than the nine homicides reported by that date last year and about 33% less than the six killings reported by Nov. 1, 2021.  Little Rock police on Oct. 12 investigated the first homicide of last month when officers responded around 7:48 p.m. to a parking lot at 5517 West 51st St. -- the address of the Geyer Springs II apartments. There they located Mario Collins, 40, who had been fatally shot.  As of Saturday, police had not released any information about a suspect or suspects in Collins' killing.  On Oct. 13, Little Rock police officers responding around 4:51 p.m. to a report of a ""subject down"" near 8400 Mabelvale Pike located Marvin Jenkins Sr., 47, and Marvin Jenkins Jr., 21, shot. Both died at the scene.  The father and son were located in a vehicle in the middle of the road reported to police by a passerby, an affidavit written by a police detective states.  Detectives located two 9 mm shell casings at the scene and evidence of projectile strikes to both the back of the car's driver's seat headrest and the seat back of a wheelchair thought to belong to Jenkins Jr., who was paralyzed from the waist down, the affidavit states.  In the floorboard of the car detectives found a bottle of iced tea that had a latent fingerprint identified as belonging to Daylon Bland, 20, the affidavit states. Surveillance footage from the area of the homicide also showed a person matching Bland's description leaving the scene around the time of the killing. Phone records also showed Bland and Jenkins Jr. had been in contact the day of the killing.  Police arrested Bland on Oct. 26. He pleaded innocent Oct. 27 to a pair of capital murder charges and was held in the Pulaski County jail on Saturday without bail, records show.  Also on Oct. 13, North Little Rock police around 10:39 p.m. located Ursula Graham, 26, dead in a vehicle outside the Hemlock Courts Apartments at 400 North Palm St.  Graham, who had been a deputy at the Pulaski County jail since February, failed to report for work, county authorities said. A welfare check led to the discovery of her body.  North Little Rock police refused to release details about the type of wounds Graham suffered, stating they are important details of the case. They have not released any information about a suspect or suspects in the killing.  Little Rock police on Oct. 14 around 5:16 p.m. were responding to ShotSpotter reports of at least 38 gunshots over about a minute in the 1100 block of Washington Street and the 4500 block of 12th Street when they stopped a vehicle driving the wrong way on Cedar Street near the 12th Street Police Substation, according to another affidavit.  Inside the vehicle were four people, two of whom had been shot, the affidavit states. One, a minor, was taken to an area hospital for treatment of a leg wound, while the other -- 15-year-old Davin Holmes -- had been shot in the back and head and was already dead.  Detectives located projectile strikes at the Millionz Corner Barbershop Lounge at 4501 West 12th St. and located a bullet-damaged SUV in the parking lot, the affidavit states. There was also damage to the gas station at 4511 West 12th St.  Investigators recovered 14 shell casings near the intersection of 12th and Washington streets and three more in a grass lot behind a residence at 1123 Washington St., where witnesses said they saw people shooting.  Video surveillance footage allowed police to identify four suspects -- Charles Gantt, 16, Markeise Murphy, 19, Taquan Porter-Baker and Bryant Thompson Jr., 23 -- in the vicinity at the time of the shooting, the affidavit states.  Gantt and Porter-Baker are both seen shooting at the victims in the parking lot of the barber shop, the affidavit states. Gantt fled in a different direction than the other three, but police suspected Murphy and Gantt knew each other because officers encountered them together in a previous traffic stop.  The surviving victims told police they didn't know who was shooting at them, the affidavit states.  All four face charges of capital murder and first-degree battery in the incident. Porter-Baker, Thompson and Murphy pleaded innocent, court records showed. Gantt's case could not be located on an online court record site.  Porter-Baker, Thompson and Murphy were held in the Pulaski County jail Saturday, an online inmate roster showed. Porter-Baker and Thompson had no bond amount listed, while Murphy was held in lieu of a $300,000 bond. The jail's online inmate roster does not display minor inmates, so Gantt was not visible.  Around 8 p.m. on Oct. 25, Little Rock officers responding to a report of a shooting at 6510 Mabelvale Cutoff -- the address of the Bella Vista apartments -- located Marquis Harper, 21, fatally shot.  Police on Saturday had yet to publicly identify a suspect or suspects in Harper's killing.  Little Rock police around 4:14 p.m. on Oct. 26 responded to a report of shots fired near 3600 Springer Boulevard and located Kelvin Hawkins, 32, shot in the road outside the Stonewood Apartments. He died of his wounds Oct. 28, police said.  Investigators as of Saturday had not publicly identified any suspects in Hawkins' killing.  On Oct. 27, around 4:52 p.m., Little Rock officers responding to a report of a shooting at 7620 Baseline Road located three vehicles wrecked in the intersection of Baseline and Chicot roads.  Inside one of the vehicles, police located Semaj O'Neal, 15, who had been shot in the head. Another victim, also a minor, was found on the scene with a gunshot wound to his leg, while two more gunshot victims from the same incident turned up at an area hospital for treatment.  The other wounded people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, but O'Neal died from his wounds Wednesday, police said.  Police have not publicly identified a suspect in O'Neal's killing.  As of Saturday, Little Rock police had made arrests in 28 cases out of 45 homicide incidents. In some incidents, more than one person was killed. In two more investigations, the case had been closed because the leading suspect died, while in three more cases, police were waiting for a prosecutor to determine if criminal charges were warranted in the incident, a process known as file review.  Also by Saturday, North Little Rock police had made arrests in half of their 18 homicide investigations so far this year. Another case was in file review, and another was the police shooting of a suspect and was still under review.  Pulaski County deputies by Saturday had made arrests in all four of their homicide investigations so far in 2023.  Little Rock police assisted University of Arkansas at Little Rock police in arresting a suspect in a Sept. 9 killing that happened at one of the school's apartment complexes. It was the university police department's only homicide investigation so far this year.  So far this year, Sherwood police had made an arrest in one of their two 2023 homicide investigations, while Jacksonville police had made an arrest in their single homicide investigation. A May double homicide on Arkansas 161 near Scott investigated by Arkansas State Police troopers was still unsolved Saturday."

Mark McNamara, who joined the San Jose Police Department in 2017, quit last week after being notified of an investigation into his offensive messages, Police Chief Anthony Mata told the Bay Area News Group. Mata said McNamara was being investigated by the departmentâs internal affairs unit for an unrelated and unspecified matter, and that led to the revelation that he âhad sent disgusting text messages that demonstrated racial bias.â A dossier of text messages show McNamara talking to two unnamed recipients and referring to the March 27, 2022, shooting of Kâaun Green, according to the chief. McNamara shot and wounded Green, who is Black, after Green appeared to have quelled a fight that broke out inside an eatery near San Jose State University. Green disarmed one of the people in the fight, and was backing out of the front door, holding a confiscated handgun in the air, when he was shot, according to police. In a text message dated the day after the shooting, McNamara appears to refer to Green with a racial slur. Other messages from June 2023 appear to have been sent while McNamara was being interviewed by the City Attorneyâs Office and Greenâs legal team, which sued the city over the shooting.

Their elections will be run by an army of poll workers, many of them citizen volunteers who receive only token payment for their efforts.  They will open the polls, check voter lists, monitor voting machines and count votes. These unsung jobs embody the machinery of democracy in action, where political partisanship meets the hard reality of numbers. To work, this machinery depends on the trust of the American public, if republican government is to survive.  In recent years, we have seen right-wing activists abetted by demagogic mainstream politicians fuel baseless and ultimately subversive theories of widespread election fraud. Two-thirds of Republicans still believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. Such suspicion has spread to infect even local contests and the most benign election practices. In 2022, no fewer than one-third of election workers reported that they knew at least one person who quit because of fears and threats.  Advertisement  The systematic assault on elections has begun to recall the most politically fraught period in our history, the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era of the 1860s and 1870s.  Opinion Op-Ed: Why book bans and voter suppression go hand in hand Voting is essential in any democracy. So is memory. That’s why many states that enact restrictive voting rules also embrace book bans to suppress history and ideas.  The raw violence of that era was far worse than we see today. White supremacist Democrats knew that the fragile Republican Party’s survival in the South depended on Black voters, who would have to be scared away from the polls if the Democrats were to prevail.  Thousands of newly enfranchised Black Americans and their white allies were threatened, beaten and murdered by the Ku Klux Klan simply for daring to attempt to vote in the former Confederate states. Registrars were menaced while they were making out certificates. White mobs physically pushed Black voters away from the ballot boxes. In some localities, Black voters were herded to the polls by armed men and forced to vote Democratic. In some counties, constables were too frightened to guard the polls. In Savannah, Ga., local police shot and killed several Black people and drove the rest away from the polls.  In scores of counties, the Republican vote was simply erased.  Despite such dangers, astonishing numbers of determined Black voters continued to flock to the polls enabling the Republicans to retain their majorities in Congress. Had it not been for the hundreds of thousands of Black Southerners who cast their ballots for Ulysses S. Grant, he would have lost the elections of 1868 and 1872, and Reconstruction would have come to an abrupt halt.  Advertisement  By 1872, the worst violence was over. But new forms of voter suppression replaced overt terrorism as white supremacists steadily regained control of the Southern states. The Supreme Court ruled in a series of decisions that the enforcement of civil rights lay with the states, not the federal government, effectively crippling the 14th Amendment’s guarantees of equal protection. From the 1880s on, literacy tests and other forms of discrimination methodically subverted Black voting, and by the 20th century almost no Black Southerners were voting at all.  In our own day, the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol showed the climate of violence that increasingly infuses our political culture. The most immediate threat, however, may be the subtler assaults on the process of elections.  Death threats against ordinary election workers have become commonplace. In some states, local vigilantes claiming to be freelance “election monitors” have sought to intimidate both voters and poll workers. In the wake of the 2020 election, self-appointed “cyber sleuths” in several states were permitted access to county voting machines in their partisan effort to find evidence of widespread fraud that supposedly prevented Donald Trump from winning re-election. Frivolous lawsuits have targeted poll workers with limited means, forcing them to defend themselves.  Other sinister trends are also at work. The systematic spread of disinformation from extremist right-wing sources continues to undermine public trust in voting and democratic institutions. False rumors of fraud remain epidemic in the right-wing ecosphere.  In the 1960s, said Douglas, Ga., Mayor Pro Tem Olivia Coley-Pearson, officials created impossible “tests” at the polls to prevent Black people from voting. “Where we are [now] is a more sophisticated means of voter suppression,” she said. “We are currently moving backwards.” Coley-Pearson herself has been charged with crimes twice for trying to help inexperienced voters cast their ballots .  In many states, Republican legislatures have arbitrarily restricted mail-in balloting, curtailed the number of days for voting, barred same-day registration and aggressively purged voter rolls, all measures that are likely to have the greatest impact on minority voters. Just in the last few weeks, Virginia removed 3,500 legal voters from its rolls. In October, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina forced through a law that could ultimately allow the GOP-controlled State Assembly to decide contested elections .  Forceful and consistent action by federal and — where possible — state authorities as well as nonpartisan citizens’ groups is essential if we are not to let our democracy slip through our fingers.  The Department of Justice must move quickly to use its existing powers to counter the intimidation of poll workers and racial discrimination against voters. More public resources must be devoted to the safety of election workers.  More trust in the election system must be established through better civics education at all ages. Former elected officials from both parties should be enlisted to support and explain election administration to build public trust. More work is also needed at every level to combat election-related disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories.  Bipartisan citizens’ groups should demand independent redistricting commissions and work to halt partisan purges of voter rolls, racial gerrymandering and restrictions on easy access to polls and early voting. They should also be prepared to sue governments that refuse to act to protect the democratic process.  These are challenging goals. But they are not impossible ones. The urgent lesson to be drawn from Reconstruction is that rights can be snatched away by partisan forces bent on eroding democracy. Passivity in the face of subversion is not a policy.  Fergus M.

The incident marred the excitement ahead of the game between Brazil’s Fluminense and Argentina’s Boca Juniors, due on Saturday at Rio de Janeiro’s famed Maracana stadium.  A mob swept across Copacabana beach, sending hundreds of others stampeding away from the commotion, some clutching caipirinhas and hastily gathered clothes.  Conmebol, the continental governing body of soccer in South America, met Friday with directors of the Brazilian Football Confederation, the Argentine Football Association, Fluminense and Boca Juniors to discuss security.  The meeting was called after Thursday’s bawl on Copacabana that saw nine arrested across the city’s affluent southern zone, police said.  Brazil’s police have drawn criticism for their response as images posted on social media by Argentine’s Diario Olé outlet showed one officer pointing his gun at supporters on the beach and others using batons against Boca fans.  It wasn’t immediately clear if live ammunition was involved but no fans were reported shot by police.  “Nothing justifies a repression as brutal as that seen in Copacabana, where there were even children,” Argentina’s Ambassador to Brazil Daniel Scioli said Thursday evening on X, formerly known as Twitter.  “You mistreated us,” read the Portuguese headline on the Argentine daily’s Diario Olé front page on Friday, plastered across what appeared to be a screenshot from the video showing police in military gear, pointing their guns.  Fans of Boca had gathered in the Buenos Aires bar on Copacabana, drinking and singing all day Thursday, said Facundo Barbero, a 39-year-old Argentine who has been living in Rio for five years and who was among the fans at the bar.  “Fluminense fans came to take photos with the Argentines and the atmosphere was relaxed until 19:30 when the police arrived, hitting people with batons, firing shots and using tear gas,” Barbero said.  Conmebol hopes to avoid holding the final without spectators, which would tarnish the image of the tournament, Globo news outlet reported.  “It is essential to take extreme precaution,” Conmebol said in a statement after Friday’s meeting and urged fans of Boca Juniors and Fluminense “to share together the moments of joy and celebration that soccer gives us.”  Rio’s military police will deploy 2,200 officers ahead of the match, it said in a video on Instagram. A fan zone has been erected on Copacabana, and there will also be giant screens in Cinelandia Square in the city center and in the Sambodrome - famed for the carnival parades."

One of the 63-year-old woman’s legs had to be amputated by doctors, according to Taylorsville police. Officers were forced to fatally shoot one of the “violent” pit bulls when it also threatened officers, according to police.  As of Thursday afternoon, the woman remained hospitalized in critical condition and police had not yet been able to speak to her to ask what led up to the attack.  The incident happened about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday at the woman’s home near 4800 South and 2900 West. The woman called 911 while injured and still in her backyard to report “she had been attacked and bitten by several dogs who are owned by her son,” according to a prepared statement from police.  “The woman also reported that the family of pit bulls, including the mother and father dogs and five puppies, were still in the backyard with her. She was able to call 911 on a mobile phone she had with her,” police said.  According to a spokeswoman for Taylorsville, the adult male dog was 1 year old, the female was 3 years old, and the puppies were 3 months old. The woman was attacked after she went to the backyard to feed them. The dogs have lived at the home their entire lives and the woman was familiar with them, according to the city. What prompted the attack on Tuesday was still under investigation.  Officers arrived to find the woman injured, semiconscious and still surrounded by the pack.  “The dogs also aggressively confronted paramedics and police, who deployed pepper spray to drive them away so they could jump the fence. From there, they were able to get the dogs away from the woman, containing them in a group along the opposite fence,” police said.  After the woman was taken to a local hospital, her 38-year-old son surrendered his dogs to the city. But as officers attempted to secure the two adult dogs, the female “broke loose, endangering both Taylorsville police and animal control officers on scene, (and) was fatally shot by police,” according to the city.  The dogs were in the custody of animal control on Thursday afternoon. Police were speaking to their owner to determine if they were aggressive before the attack.

It likely did save her life,” he said in a statement.  The woman’s family in a statement thanked the 911 dispatcher “for staying on the phone with our mother” and “the police officers that didn’t hesitate to get to her as soon as possible.”  The family also thanked the paramedics, nurses, doctors “and everyone that helped our mother survive this horrible event.”  Contributing: Alex Cabrero  Click here for updates on this story  The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Thousands of Argentines poured into Rio ahead of the game between Brazilâs Fluminense and Argentinaâs Boca Juniors, due on Saturday at Rio’s famed Maracana stadium, much like they did for the 2014 World Cup final in Rio. A mob swept across Copacabana beach and fighting broke out between fans of the two teams Thursday, sending hundreds of others stampeding away from the commotion, some clutching caipirinhas and hastily gathered clothes. Police said seven Argentines and two Brazilians were arrested. âThey’re dominating Rio de Janeiro,â said Diana Santos, who was relaxing on Copacabana beach Friday, a Fluminense cap perched on her head and a beer in her hand. Santos lives nearby and saw Thursday’s brawl from her window. âWe’re a bit strained because of the size of their fan base,â she said. Not far from Santos, a huge crowd of people wearing the yellow and blue colors of Boca Juniors sang and jumped. Fireworks illuminated the sky above them, mingling with the colored smoke bombs. Other fans sat sipping yerba mate, a typical herbal drink of Argentina. Hotels neared maximum capacity ahead of the game, particularly in the beachside tourist areas such as Copacabana, Leme, Ipanema and Leblon, according to Rio’s main hotel associations. Many Argentine fans travelled thousands of miles to support their team. âThere are stories of people hitchhiking, even biking to get here,â said Matias Garnica, 38, for whom supporting Boca has been a lifelong passion. He came from Santiago del Estero, over 1,700 miles (2,400 kilomters) from Rio. âNo one likes it when outsiders come to party in their home,â Garnica said, in reference to yesterday’s chaotic scenes. Conmebol, the continental governing body of soccer in South America, met Friday with directors of the Brazilian Football Confederation, the Argentine Football Association, Fluminense and Boca to discuss security.

The unrest called to mind scenes from the Copa Libertadores final five years ago, when Boca was also playing. In that case, the team was playing its staunch rivals River Plate. Violence broke out and the match was postponed twice in a major embarrassment for South American soccer. âIt is essential to take extreme precaution,â Conmebol said in a statement after Friday’s meeting and urged fans of Boca Juniors and Fluminense âto share together the moments of joy and celebration that soccer gives us.â Rioâs military police will deploy 2,200 officers ahead of the match, it said in a video on Instagram.

Mata said McNamara was being investigated by the department’s internal affairs unit for an unrelated criminal matter, which led to the revelation that the now-former officer “had sent disgusting text messages that demonstrated racial bias.”  “I don’t stand for this. It’s disgusting and horrible that we have an officer that thinks that way,” Mata said. “All this information came to light this week … I wanted to get this information out to the public so they understand that as chief, I’m committed to rid people and employees who act in this manner.”  A dossier of text messages investigated by the department appear to show McNamara talking to two unnamed recipients — described only as one active department employee and a former department employee — and at some point, referencing the March 27, 2022 shooting of K’aun Green.  McNamara shot and wounded Green, who is Black, after Green appeared to have quelled a fight that broke out inside the La Victoria taqueria near San Jose State University. Green disarmed one of the people in the fight, and was backing out of the front door, holding the confiscated handgun in the air, when he was shot.  In a text message dated the day after the shooting, McNamara appears to refer to Green: “N—- wanted to carry a gun in the Wild West … Not on my watch.”  Other messages from late June 2023 appear to have been sent while McNamara was being interviewed by the City Attorney’s Office and Green’s legal team, which sued the city over the shooting.  “I finally had to tell this city attorney what’s what,” one text reads. “I’m like dude, I don’t give a shit about this case. I’m white, he’s black, he’s gonna win. AND I DONT CARE. It’s a b—- whatever they decide has no bearing on me what so ever. It’s basically kangaroo court.”  Another message around the same time appears to disparage Green and his attorney: “The other day this n— lawyer is like Mr McNamara, you know we can still find you guilty of excessive force right? I’m like, hmmm yeah then (what) happens?? … Think I give a f—- what y’all n—- think?!???? I’ll shoot you too!!!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!”  In a subsequent message, McNamara said of Green’s legal team: “They should all be bowing to me and bringing me gifts since I saved a fellow n—- by making him rich as f—. Otherwise, he woulda lived a life of poverty and crime.”  Adanté Pointer, whose firm Lawyers for the People is representing Green, said the messages affirmed to him that the shooting of his client “was driven by racial animus.”  “The proof is in the pudding. We don’t have to guess, we have it right here in his own words,” Pointer said. “Each and every interaction he’s had as a police officer, every ticket, every citation, every time he used force, every arrest, it all has to be reviewed.”  Pointer added: “He was nothing more than essentially a racist cop who was hellbent to bring his fantasies to life. Despite his expressed hatred and willingness to kill my client and my legal team, we will not be intimidated.”  McNamara resigned from the department Wednesday. Mata said the text messages being investigated were made to one former department officer and one current officer, and that the latter was placed on administrative leave Thursday.  Mata said he was prohibited from speaking further about the officer on leave, but said the officer’s participation in the text exchange was “not as egregious” as what McNamara wrote, but was nonetheless “concerning.”  Rev. Jethroe Moore, president of the San Jose-Silicon Valley NAACP, said the news left him “shivering” with anger, and thinking about past racism controversies with the department.  “I believe this officer committed a hate crime. He seemed to be gloating over and nonchalant about” the shooting, Moore said. “He should be decertified as soon as possible.”  The city’s reaction to the controversy was swift Friday evening. In a statement, Mayor Matt Mahan said “there is nothing more sickening than a person in power abusing their position.”  “I will sleep better tonight knowing that this individual is no longer carrying a badge and a gun. Assuming these allegations are upheld, he should face the full consequences of his actions,” the statement reads.  Mahan lauded Mata and the department for disclosing the scandal “in the spirit of full transparency.” Mata said in an interview that was a concerted effort: “This is the fastest disclosure we’ve provided as a department for misconduct.”  San Jose Police Officers’ Association President Steve Slack said the text message investigation “is a disconcerting reminder that not everyone has the moral compass necessary to be in the law enforcement profession … This behavior is beyond unacceptable, and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.”  The chief, mayor and police union all emphasized that McNamara’s actions should not taint the rest of the police department, with Slack saying “it is not a reflection of those of us who serve with honor and who treat every member of our community with the respect and dignity they deserve.”  Scandals over racist text exchanges among police officers have steadily surfaced over the past few years in the Bay Area, including the police departments in San Francisco, Antioch and the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. They were all characterized by what appeared to be wide permissiveness among the text recipients.  In the Antioch case, the texts contained disparaging messages about Black people and even joked about violence against the city’s mayor, who is Black. In the sheriff’s office case, the deputy union president and the correctional officer union president were ensnared in a trove of messages containing racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic slurs, as well as images of swastikas and Ku Klux Klan members.  San Jose police experienced its own recent scandal when, in the midst of the George Floyd demonstrations in 2020, a Facebook page of current and former officers was brought to light in which members made racist and Islamophobic comments, joked about harassing Muslim people, and insulted the Black Lives Matter protesters. The fallout included one officer who was terminated — but got his job back in arbitration — and another officer who was issued a suspension.  McNamara gained a higher public profile than the average rank-and-file officer after the shooting of Green. San Jose police officers were examining the scene of a homicide less than a block away when they were alerted to people fleeing from the restaurant and at least one mention of a gun sighting.  Security video released last year showed a man appearing to start a fight with Green by throwing a punch at the former McClymonds High School star quarterback. Green then rushed the man and took him to the ground before landing several punches to his head.  Seconds later, a second man, who police identified as 30-year-old Bryan Carter, brandishes a handgun, but Green’s friend wrapped up Carter and attempted to take control of the weapon. Green then got up and helped his friend take the handgun away from Carter, with Green taking sole possession of the firearm.  At one point, the magazine of the handgun fell to the ground, and Green could be seen loading it back into the gun. At some point the fight subsided, and Green walked backward toward the front door as Carter and the man who Green fought kept walking after him, seeming to grab at the handgun, which Green was holding up in the air in his left hand.  McNamara was at the front of a contingent of officers approaching the taqueria entrance. Security footage shows McNamara and other officers yelling at Green to drop the gun. Green had his back to the officers as he exited and was trying to fend off the two men trying to retake the gun, the footage shows.  Green turned slightly toward the officers and it appeared that once he recognized them he showed his hands, but by that point McNamara fired four shots in quick succession.  Police later said that at the time the shots were fired, officers had no way of discerning that Green was a peacemaker and were reacting solely to the sight of the gun and him not releasing it. Green and his attorney contend that he had no opportunity to comply before he was shot."

Thousands of Argentines poured into Rio ahead of the game between Brazilâs Fluminense and Argentinaâs Boca Juniors, due on Saturday at Rio’s famed Maracana stadium, much like they did for the 2014 World Cup final in Rio. A mob swept across Copacabana beach and fighting broke out between fans of the two teams Thursday, sending hundreds of others stampeding away from the commotion, some clutching caipirinhas and hastily gathered clothes. Police said seven Argentines and two Brazilians were arrested. âThey’re dominating Rio de Janeiro,â said Diana Santos, who was relaxing on Copacabana beach Friday, a Fluminense cap perched on her head and a beer in her hand. Santos lives nearby and saw Thursday’s brawl from her window. âWe’re a bit strained because of the size of their fan base,â she said. Not far from Santos, a huge crowd of people wearing the yellow and blue colors of Boca Juniors sang and jumped. Fireworks illuminated the sky above them, mingling with the colored smoke bombs. Other fans sat sipping yerba mate, a typical herbal drink of Argentina. Hotels neared maximum capacity ahead of the game, particularly in the beachside tourist areas such as Copacabana, Leme, Ipanema and Leblon, according to Rio’s main hotel associations. Many Argentine fans travelled thousands of miles to support their team. âThere are stories of people hitchhiking, even biking to get here,â said Matias Garnica, 38, for whom supporting Boca has been a lifelong passion. He came from Santiago del Estero, over 1,700 miles (2,400 kilomters) from Rio. âNo one likes it when outsiders come to party in their home,â Garnica said, in reference to yesterday’s chaotic scenes. Conmebol, the continental governing body of soccer in South America, met Friday with directors of the Brazilian Football Confederation, the Argentine Football Association, Fluminense and Boca to discuss security. Argentines criticized Brazilâs police for their response as images posted on social media by Argentine’s Diario OlÃ© outlet showed one officer pointing his gun at supporters on the beach and others using batons against Boca fans. It wasn’t immediately clear if live ammunition was involved but no fans were reported shot by police. âNothing justifies a repression as brutal as that seen in Copacabana, where there were even children,â Argentinaâs Ambassador to Brazil, Daniel Scioli, said Thursday evening on X, formerly known as Twitter. âYou mistreated us,â read the Portuguese headline on Diario OlÃ©’s front page on Friday, plastered across what appeared to be a screenshot from the video showing police in military gear, pointing their guns. Fans of Boca had gathered in a bar on Copacabana, drinking and singing all day Thursday, said Facundo Barbero, a 39-year-old Argentine who has been living in Rio for five years and who was among the fans at the bar. âFluminense fans came to take photos with the Argentines and the atmosphere was relaxed until 19:30 when the police arrived, hitting people with batons, firing shots and using tear gas,â Barbero said. The unrest called to mind scenes from the Copa Libertadores final five years ago, when Boca was also playing. In that case, the team was playing its staunch rivals River Plate. Violence broke out and the match was postponed twice in a major embarrassment for South American soccer. âIt is essential to take extreme precaution,â Conmebol said in a statement after Friday’s meeting and urged fans of Boca Juniors and Fluminense âto share together the moments of joy and celebration that soccer gives us.â Rioâs military police will deploy 2,200 officers ahead of the match, it said in a video on Instagram. A fan zone has been erected on Copacabana, and there will also be giant screens in Cinelandia Square in the city center and in the Sambodrome â famed for the carnival parades."

The deputies attempted to make a traffic stop, but the driver reportedly refused to stop, according to the news release. The driver eluded deputies for several miles during a chase through west Fort Collins.  Just after 1 a.m., a deputy deployed tire spikes at the intersection of Horsetooth Road and College Avenue. The driver of the vehicle, traveling east in the westbound lanes, drove at the deputy, and the deputy fired his weapon, according to the news release.  The driver then drove away but stopped near Horsetooth Road and Shields Street.  A man and woman got out. The man was taken into custody after a short pursuit on foot.  The woman stayed at the scene and was taken to a hospital. The news release did not specify her injuries.  After the two people got out, the driver continued traveling north on Shields Street, and deputies deployed more tire spikes. The driver swerved to avoid the spikes and crashed, according to the news release.  A man was extricated from the vehicle and taken to a hospital with serious injuries from the crash. No one else was injured, according to the news release.  The 8th Judicial District critical incident response team was activated to investigate the shooting."

The video — which was edited and included captions, radio snippets and selected body-worn camera footage — comes six weeks after Berkeley police fatally shot Lamar Walker, 24, on Sept. 21 at the Toyota of Berkeley Service Center near Berkeley’s border with Albany.  Authorities suspect Walker, of Vacaville, killed Alonna Gallon, 24, of Richmond, before turning the gun on himself and attempting suicide.  The video shows security camera footage of Walker approaching a desk in the service center were Gallon — whose face was blurred out — had been sitting in front of a computer and working. The clip ends a few seconds after he arrives at the desk, just as Walker began pulling a gun from his waistband.  Subsequent footage shows Walker, dressed in a beige or pink hoodie, laying on the floor at the base of the desk where Gallon had been sitting as officers begin storming the service center. He appeared to try to get up several times from the ground — all while pointing a revolver at the officers — and was fatally shot by officers moments later.  The incident was initially reported at 11:15 a.m. that day as an active shooter event, prompting a torrent of officers to descend on the car service center. Berkeley officers first evacuated the area, then entered the building in search of the suspected shooter and any victims inside.

Walker was hit by multiple rounds and died in the service center. All five officers have since returned to duty.  Jessica Perry, a Berkeley police spokesperson, said during the video that investigations into the shooting are ongoing. Among those ongoing investigations is an inquiry by the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office into officers’ actions that day, which is standard after police shootings.  “What we know right now for certain is that this was not a random crime,” Perry said. “Ms. Gallon’s death was a senseless act of violence that left a young boy without his mother, a child she was co-parenting with Mr. Walker.”  Gallon worked in the service center’s call center and also held jobs at a car rental company and a grocery store, according to her mother, Yuvonda Gallon. She and Walker were the parents of a 7-year-old son, King Walker.  “She was quiet, but she did nothing but smile,” Yuvonda Gallon said of her daughter. “She had a million-dollar smile, as her boss at the service center would say. Mostly, she just loved her son. She was a single mother, and was willing to do whatever she had to do.”  Yuvonda Gallon later established a GoFundMe page for the child. As of Friday, the fundraiser had brought in more than $54,000."

Thomas Nock, 27, of Elyria was fatally wounded by officers. Officials found the body of Christopher Torrisi, 52, in the burning home on Alden Drive. The incident began at about 1:30 a.m. when neighbors called police after hearing gunshots.  “I live in North Olmsted and just heard gunshots five minutes ago,” a caller told police.  A woman notified authorities after a man, who was covered in blood, approached her car on Lorain Road and told her that someone had broken into his home, tried to rob him and was trying to kill him and his uncle in a house at 28456 Alden Drive.  North Olmsted and Westlake police responded to the home, where officers heard a gunshot and saw smoke billowing out the front door, according to body camera video from North Olmsted police.  Police said officers saw Nock running out of the home’s front door, heading west through backyards on Alden Drive. They followed Nock through the neighborhood.  The body-camera footage shows an officer repeatedly telling Nock to stop moving. Nock, who had a 9 mm gun, appeared to get stuck in bushes in the backyard of a home on Berkshire Drive.  “I know you’re stuck. Don’t move,” the officer said, as he held Nock at gunpoint.  At least 10 gunshots were then heard. It is unclear how many bullets Nock fired and whether he shot first, according to the video footage.  The North Olmsted officer was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the chest. A bulletproof vest stopped the bullet to the chest.  “Shots fired! Shots fired! I’m hit,” the officer yelled, according to the video.  Officers from Westlake and North Olmsted returned fire, shooting Nock. He was transported to Fairview Hospital, where he later died.  The North Olmsted officer applied a tourniquet to his left arm. Westlake police transported him to UH St. John Medical Center, where he was later released. He is the first officer shot in the line of duty in North Olmsted.  After the fire on Alden Drive was extinguished, authorities found the body of Torrisi inside the home. He had been shot several times, said Bob Wagner, the North Olmsted police chief. Authorities confirmed that an accelerant helped start the fire.  Torrisi’s death is the first homicide in North Olmsted since June, when a man killed a person and himself at a grocery store.  Police identified the man who approached the 911 caller on Lorain Road as Torrisi’s nephew. He had been knocking on neighbors’ doors for help after Nock assaulted him.  Wagner said police are not searching for any other suspects involved with the shooting and fire.  The police chief said Torrisi and Nock were both known to police. Wagner said Torrisi had “a long criminal history” including drugs, robbery and more.  He also said the police department has had issues with Nock since June.  “There is a long history associated with the house at 28456 Alden Drive – our police department is very familiar with those involved on what happened,” North Olmsted Mayor Nicole Dailey Jones said.  Torrisi was recently issued an eviction notice from his stepmother, police said.  Jones said an emergency demolition order was placed to tear down the home.  Wagner and Sgt. Matthew Beck said the officer who was shot is recovering at home. Beck said the officer’s vest saved his life.  He commended neighbors in the area for calling 911, cooperating with police and evacuating quickly.  Vanessa Guzman has lived around the corner from the home for more than seven years.  “I was falling asleep in my family room and heard several gunshots, but I honestly thought it was part of my dream,” she said Monday. “Nothing like this has ever happened here. It’s just crazy.”  The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting. North Olmsted police are examining the arson."

A knife-wielding man who had just attacked a victim with a machete was fatally shot by Los Angeles police officers outside the popular Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas, police said.  The shooting occurred about 7:40 p.m. Wednesday when police responded to a call about an assault with a deadly weapon in the 23300 block of Avenue San Luis in nearby Woodland Hills, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The gunman was not immediately identified.  The man had allegedly attacked another person with a machete in a McDonald’s parking lot nearby, police said. The victim was able to disarm the attacker, who then took up a knife.  Responding officers found the man running from the scene with the knife, authorities said.  The man then headed toward the open Sagebrush Cantina restaurant on Calabasas Road. The restaurant was open and had customers inside, police said.  Advertisement  “As the suspect entered the parking lot area of the restaurant they deployed a taser at the suspect, who was armed with a knife in one hand and a glass bottle in the other hand. The taser appears to have been ineffective,” the LAPD said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.  Preliminary information based on an ongoing investigation.    On November 1st at approximately 7:38pm, LAPD Officers assigned to Topanga Division Patrol responded to a radio call on the 23300 block of Avenue San Luis of an Assault with a Deadly Weapon suspect armed with a machete. — LAPD PIO (@LAPDPIO) November 2, 2023  The officers said they tried to tase the man a second time but he then moved to the patio of the restaurant.  At one point, the man turned and faced the officers “still armed with the knife,” police said.  “Shortly thereafter, an officer-involved shooting occurred,” police said. “The suspect was struck by the [officers’] gunfire.”  The suspected was transported to a local hospital, where he died.  No officers were injured in the incident.  The Sagebrush Cantina, which opened in 1974, is a mainstay of old town Calabasas. The popular Mexican restaurant is located just south of the 101 Freeway and serves thousands of people per week."
"2 women say they plan to sue after Portland police mistook them for suspect, crashed into their car, held them at gunpoint",2023-11-02,2023-11-02T03:47:17Z,en,oregonlive.com,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2023/11/2-women-say-they-plan-to-sue-after-portland-police-mistook-them-for-suspect-crashed-into-their-car-held-them-at-gunpoint.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102034717id_/https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2023/11/2-women-say-they-plan-to-sue-after-portland-police-mistook-them-for-suspect-crashed-into-their-car-held-them-at-gunpoint.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20231102034717/https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2023/11/2-women-say-they-plan-to-sue-after-portland-police-mistook-them-for-suspect-crashed-into-their-car-held-them-at-gunpoint.html,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLG9yZWdvbmxpdmUpL3BvcnRsYW5kLzIwMjMvMTEvMi13b21lbi1zYXktdGhleS1wbGFuLXRvLXN1ZS1hZnRlci1wb3J0bGFuZC1wb2xpY2UtbWlzdG9vay10aGVtLWZvci1zdXNwZWN0LWNyYXNoZWQtaW50by10aGVpci1jYXItaGVsZC10aGVtLWF0LWd1bnBvaW50Lmh0bWw~,"Two women intend to sue the City of Portland after they say Portland police officers drove into their car and held them at gunpoint by mistake.  Portland attorney Michael Cox notified Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, the city’s Bureau of Emergency Communications and the city attorney on Oct. 30 of the women’s intent to sue for civil rights violations, negligence, assault and battery.  The Portland Police Bureau referred questions to the city attorney’s office, which declined to comment.  Colleen McDonald, 31, and Hilary Rossio, 30, said they were returning to Portland from a day trip to the Columbia River Gorge about 8:45 p.m. on Aug. 29 when Portland police officers drove a police car into McDonald’s silver 2012 Ford Fusion without warning. McDonald’s car spun around before it was struck by a second police vehicle.  “That’s when, all of a sudden, their headlights and police lights all turned on and at least seven police officers were surrounding our car screaming, ‘Get your (expletive) hands up,’” Rossio told The Oregonian/OregonLive.  Some of the officers pointed their guns at the women, who said they remained in the car, in pain and too afraid to move.  “We were just yelling, ‘You’ve got the wrong people,’” Rossio said.  About two minutes later, Rossio said she heard an officer say, ‘I think we might have the wrong people.’” The officers lowered their guns and the women exited the damaged car – McDonald crawling over the center console to get out through the passenger side door, as the driver’s side door was blocked by a police vehicle.  An officer who sat with them while they waited for a sergeant to arrive at the scene said he had never seen a similar incident in his 28 years in the bureau, Rossio said.  The officers had mistaken McDonald’s Ford Fusion for a silver car that had sped past the women earlier that night, dangerously weaving through traffic, in the westbound lanes of Interstate 84, the women said. An officer told McDonald and Rossio the other car was being driven by a man who had evaded police twice so far that night, and that the officers had been confused when they spotted McDonald’s car driving the speed limit.  McDonald and Rossio asked police if the suspect’s car was similar to McDonald’s, and the officers “said they weren’t sure,” the tort claim notice states.  Rossio said she had neck pain that night and went to an emergency room, where doctors gave her anxiety medication and muscle relaxants, and referred her to a physical therapist. McDonald had pain in her neck and lower back; she could “barely walk the next day,” she said.  The women said they now experience anxiety while driving, especially at night and when they see police lights or hear sirens.  “Any time I see a police light or a bright light behind me, I automatically pull over because it’s a kind of trigger,” Rossio said. “We just want this to not happen to anyone else – we just want the police to be accountable for this.”  “This all could have been avoided if they just pulled us over,” McDonald added.  McDonald said she isn’t sure if police ever found the man they were looking for.  An auto repair shop told McDonald it would cost $4,978.19 to repair her car. Rossio and McDonald are seeking to have their expenses from the incident covered. The tort claim notice also states the women will ask for punitive damages from the city.  Cox’s tort claim notice asserted there’s a “crisis of competence” in the police bureau, citing four other incidents since September 2020 in which officers have mistaken someone for a crime suspect, including the fatal police shooting of Immanueal Clark-Johnson in November 2022. As Clark-Johnson, 30, ran from police on Nov. 19 in Southeast Portland, Officer Christopher Sathoff shot him in the back with an AR-15, killing him. Police had mistaken Clark-Johnson, who was unarmed, for an armed-robbery suspect.  A Multnomah County grand jury in August concluded Sathoff was justified in fatally shooting Clark-Johnson.  “Given the numerous incidents of harm to innocent people resulting from misidentification, one must rightly ask what was done after each incident to prevent future incidents,” Cox wrote in his tort claim notice. “Nothing has been done to address the ongoing problem.”  -- Catalina Gaitán, cgaitan@oregonian.com, @catalinagaitan_  Our journalism needs your support.

Former Clear Creek deputy accused in Christian Glass’ death pleads not guilty,2023-11-02,2023-11-03T04:03:40Z,en,denverpost.com,https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/02/christian-glass-case-dputy-andrew-buen-not-guilty/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103040340id_/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/02/christian-glass-case-dputy-andrew-buen-not-guilty/,https://web.archive.org/web/20231103040340/https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/02/christian-glass-case-dputy-andrew-buen-not-guilty/,https://wayback-api.archive.org/colsearch/v1/mediacloud/article/Y29tLGRlbnZlcnBvc3QpLzIwMjMvMTEvMDIvY2hyaXN0aWFuLWdsYXNzLWNhc2UtZHB1dHktYW5kcmV3LWJ1ZW4tbm90LWd1aWx0eQ~~,"A former Clear Creek County sheriff’s deputy accused of killing 22-year-old Christian Glass after Glass called 911 for help while he was stuck on the side of the road and experiencing a mental health crisis pleaded not guilty in district court Thursday.  Andrew Buen is charged with second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and official misconduct for fatally shooting Glass on June 11, 2022.  Glass called 911 after crashing his car on an embankment and told the dispatcher he was afraid of “skinwalkers” and people chasing him, according to earlier reporting.  Buen was among seven law enforcement officers who responded to the call and spent an hour trying to coax Glass out of his car while Glass was experiencing delusions and paranoia.  Former Clear Creek County Sgt. Kyle Gould authorized officers to use force to remove Glass from his car. Officers shot bean bags and tased Glass, who lunged at an officer standing at the rear driver’s side window with a knife, which is when Buen shot him.  Buen and Gould were indicted by a grand jury in November.  Gould was charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment in the case.  He did not enter a plea in court Thursday, but Fifth Judicial District Attorney’s Office spokesperson John Bryan said the parties have reached a tentative resolution in the case. Gould is set to appear in court for a plea and sentencing hearing on Nov. 16.  Buen is set to appear for a motions hearing, which will include discussions about a change of venue, on Dec. 18, Bryan said.  Glass’ family received a record $19 million settlement from the state of Colorado and three local law enforcement agencies in May, along with statements saying his death was unnecessary and preventable and pledging to do better for people in crisis in the future.  The shooting will also be used in police training scenarios to teach the importance of de-escalation.  Sign up to get crime news sent straight to your inbox each day.

Itâs Wednesday, Nov. 1. Iâm Carol Cormaci, bringing you this weekâs TimesOC newsletter with a look at the latest local news and events. Orange County commuters have been eyewitnesses for the past several years as the $2.1-billion I-405 Improvement Project, which got underway in early 2018, has sometimes made driving from Point A to Point B within a reasonable amount of time a challenging prospect. But it looks like the end could be near. My Daily Pilot colleague Matt Szabo attended a media tour/update of the work hosted by the Orange County Transportation Authority last Thursday and reported the new 405 Express Lanes â for which weâve seen signage spring up as weâve driven the freeway â are scheduled to open for use Dec. 1. The 16-mile stretch of express lanes are in place from the 605 interchange to the north and State Route 73 to the south. The new express lane will combine with the existing high occupancy vehicle lane to create two express lanes in each direction. Itâs hoped that enough motorists will opt to pay for access to the Express Lanes so as to help alleviate traffic in the rest of the lanes where the masses travel, according to Szaboâs story on the work. As OCTA CEO Darrell Johnson noted and Szabo reported, the stretch where the 405, 605 and 22 come together at the northern edge of Orange County is the busiest section of freeway in America, carrying nearly 400,000 vehicles per day. âDoing a project like this under that extreme amount of volume, we think obviously itâs hard, but thereâs also a lot of benefit to have those 400,000 people a day have a different option to go through there,â Johnson is quoted as saying. The express lanes, which will require vehicles using them to have a FasTrak transponder so they can travel without having to stop to pay the toll, will be monitored around the clock from an OCTA traffic operations center in Santa Ana. According to the âHow it Worksâ page on the 405 Express Lanes site, the tolls that will be charged have not yet been determined but âcan vary by hour, day of the week and direction of travel. Traffic volumes are continuously monitored and, if warranted, tolls are adjusted quarterly up or down based on demand.â Szabo reports that three-plus person carpools and drivers with veteran or disabled person license plates will always ride free. âTwo-person carpools are charged during peak hours and free during non-peak hours, and solo drivers will always pay a toll. Clean air vehicles with the transponder receive a 15% discount.â Funds collected will go toward paying off the $629-million federal loan that OCTA received for construction of the express lanes, with Measure M also funding the freeway improvements. âTolls are set and they vary by hour, day of the week and direction of traffic,â OCTA communications manager Joel Zlotnik said on the day of the media tour. âWe monitor them constantly. Over the initial period of opening, we can adjust them, sort of on the fly. Then moving forward, theyâll get adjusted quarterly.â Take note, if youâre planning travel on the freeway this week: Before it opens, the express lanes system needs to undergo testing, according to Szaboâs reporting. So, beginning tonight (Nov. 1), the carpool lanes along the 405 in both directions will close at night, including the connector lanes between the 22 and the 405 and the 605 and 405. MORE NEWS â¢ Some Huntington Beach residents alarmed by actions of the current City Council majority have formed ProtectHB and are scheduled to hold a press conference this at 2 p.m. today, when they are expected to voice their concerns over several charter amendments the councilâs conservative members recently voted to place on the March ballot.

LIFE & LEISURE â¢ Officials with the Corona del Mar Residents Assn. and the Newport Beach Historical Society held a special ceremony last week to commemorate the areaâs first structure. A plaque was unveiled Friday at the former site of the Hotel del Mar, which opened for business on July 20, 1907, and was the only structure in sight for a few years. The hotel eventually changed hands and was remade into the Balboa Palisades Club, then a hotel again before it became the Palisades Apartments in the 1960s, which stopped operating in 1987. The building was razed in the early 1990s. Today a condominium complex occupies the land along Seaview Avenue. â¢ Two of Orange Countyâs Asian American concept eateries are teaming up for a special collaboration dish for a good cause.

Almost all of those happened as the federal agency tasked with fugitive searches arrested people on warrants, including for crimes like assault and homicide, the report said. The total includes fatal shootings, injuries and those where no one was struck. It's a step toward transparency for federal law enforcement, and comes at a time when data about police shootings remains scarce, years into a national reckoning over police brutality and racial injustice. Experts say detailed data is essential to tackling the issue, but comprehensive information for the U.S. is still lacking. U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis ordered the review last year, saying it reflects the seriousness of shots fired by officers. The report does not include information on whether the shootings were deemed legally justified nor data on more recent shootings, though it does say that those outlined in the report were independently investigated. The aim was to study policies, training, tactics and equipment to figure out ways to make shootings less likely or destructive in the future, the report released Tuesday states. One deputy U.S. Marshal was killed during the three-year period: Chase White, who was fatally shot serving a fugitive arrest warrant against a man accused of stalking a female police sergeant in Tucson, Arizona. Officers were injured by gunfire 13 times and suffered other injuries six times during the period of the report, which was composed on a fiscal year schedule. The shootings were spread across the country, with the largest number happening in regions in the West and in Texas. It found that more than half of the officers who fired shots were from other police agencies working with the deputies on task forces. Of the 266 officers involved with shootings, just under 40% were deputies. That finding has the Marshals ''committed to enhancing USMS federal oversight"" of task-force officers. The Justice Department began allowing local officers working with federal law enforcement to begin wearing body cameras in 2020, reversing a policy that had strained its relationship with some law enforcement agencies quicker to adopt their usage. There are nearly 4,000 deputy U.S. Marshals, and they work with more than 3,500 task force officers from departments around the U.S., the report states. The Marshals also transport federal prisoners, protect witnesses and provide court security. The agency will also review their policies about making arrests involving cars after finding that nearly half of the shootings happened as Marshals tried to arrest people in or around vehicles. Ten percent of those shootings also left officers injured. The report doesn't specify whether any of the cars were moving at the time; federal use-of-force policy discourages shooting at or from moving vehicles. The country's overall dearth of detailed information about police shootings, especially those that aren't fatal, makes it hard to say how those findings fit into the national picture, experts said. The FBI began collecting the data in recent years, but has struggled with low numbers of departments participating, said Lee Friedman, a public-health professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Individual police departments are increasingly releasing use-of-force data, but it can be difficult to find and often isn't deeply detailed, said Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Carolina. The Marshals report released this week is a ''good first step,'' but also leaves many questions, including details of what led up to the shooting and information on those who were shot, he said. Detailed data is important to figure out what things make police shootings more likely, and what factors drive down the risk of violence, he said. ''If we can't identify the problems how can we come up with solutions?'' Alpert said.

Police were on the lookout for Jason Pass — a 47-year-old former state correction officer and former MTA subway conductor — as the suspect in the murders of Bladimy Mathurin, 47, and his stepson Chin Wai Mode, 27, in their apartment building in East Flatbush.  Around 7:10 a.m. Wednesday, a police patrol car equipped with a license plate reader drove by Pass’ car around Bay 44th Street and Bath Avenue in Brooklyn, the NYPD said.  The reader notified officers that the driver of the car was “possibly wanted for murder,” NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said at a news conference Wednesday morning.  Maddrey said the officers called for backup and swung back around to stop Pass’ car.  Pass then got out of his car, “displayed a knife and fled on foot,” according to a statement from an NYPD spokesperson. The officers chased Pass to 187 Bay 44 St., where the spokesperson said they “were able to isolate and contain him.”  Police said the standoff lasted about 15 minutes, while officers urged Pass to drop his knife. They said he suddenly charged toward them with his knife, when cops fired multiple rounds, hitting Pass in his leg and chest.  Maddrey said “numerous” responding officers at the scene fired their guns out of concern “for their own safety.”  Pass was taken to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn, where he was pronounced dead. The officers were transported to Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn for “ringing in the ear,” police said.  The NYPD’s Force Investigation Division is investigating the incident.  Pass allegedly shot and killed Mathurin and Mode in the hallway outside their apartment around 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, after a verbal argument among them, according to the NYPD.  Surveillance video later posted to social media shows Pass confronting the two men and Mathurin’s wife and Mode’s mother Marie Luc Delille in the hallway. Mathurin approaches Pass with a pair of scissors before Delille attempts to pull her husband back toward their apartment. Pass then shoots Mode, who collapses by the stairwell, before pivoting to shoot Mathurin, who falls near the family’s front door.  Delille told Gothamist on Monday that her husband was a school bus driver who also drove for Uber, enjoyed bodybuilding and wanted to teach his children the value of hard work.  “The guy killed my family, the only family I have,” she said. “The pain is so hard. I don't know if I can survive.”  Delille added that Pass had long antagonized her family and that he repeatedly complained about noise coming from their apartment after they moved there in 2018. Other residents said they were considering leaving the building and expressed shock and horror over the killings.  On Tuesday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said an ongoing feud over noise among the neighbors fueled the double homicide, and that investigators had discovered six 311 noise complaints originating from Pass’ apartment.  From September 2004 to June 2005, Pass worked as a correction officer at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, where he was terminated, the New York state correction department said on Tuesday.  A department spokesperson said they could not confirm a reason for Pass’ firing because the relevant employee records had been destroyed after a required seven-year retention period. But a 2005 Daily News story reported Pass had been arrested that year for allegedly pointing a pistol and cursing at two plainclothes police officers in an apparent road rage incident while he was off duty. He was charged with menacing and reckless endangerment.  Pass later worked as an MTA subway conductor from 2012 to 2018, according to state payment records and an official with knowledge of his work history.  NYPD officers shot and killed 13 people last year, up from six in 2021 and the highest number since 2012, when they shot and killed 16, according to an annual use-of-force report the department released Friday. Police shot and injured another 15 people last year, and discharged nearly 500 rounds, an increase from 317 rounds in 2021 and 444 in 2012, the report found.  On Wednesday morning, after police confronted and fatally shot Pass, Gothamist reached his daughter Stephanie Pass by phone. She said Pass was a “decorated war hero” who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that she did not live at home and had not seen him recently. (Gothamist was not immediately able to verify Pass’ military service.)  “It’s just an unexplainable situation with a big question mark,” she said, calling it “extremely sad on both sides.” “This is the man that raised me, this is the man who put me through college, this is the man that raised me to make sure I became something.”  At the scene where officers shot and killed Pass, Mode's father Mike Felix said Delille was struggling to cope with the deaths of their son and Mathurin, her husband. “The way she’s talking it’s like she’s lost her mind,” Felix said.  But, he said of Pass, “killing him is not justice.”  This story has been updated with additional information."

Downstairs neighbor Jason Pass killed Bladimy Mathurin and his stepson Chinwai Mode — on video — after Mathurin’s wife, Marie Delille, had words with Pass, and Mathurin, armed with a pair of scissors, confronted him.  The whole sad, ugly affair points to how far social order has decayed in New York: Four adults couldn’t resolve a basic domestic dispute without resorting to (in this case deadly) violence.  Pass — who shot Mathurin in the back, finished him off with a shot to the head, and killed Mode despite his offering no apparent threat — then calmly rode an elevator down to the street.  Police shot him fatally Tuesday during a traffic stop that he turned violent by charging cops with a knife.  That he felt the confidence necessary for either act is a testament to the damage years of anti-police rhetoric and policy can do.  Cops identified the person who shot his neighbor and the neighbor’s stepson as 47-year-old Jason Pass (above). He was killed by police. NY Post  Surveillance video shows Jason Pass shooting his neighbors Bladimy Mathurin and Chin Wai in the hallway of their Brooklyn building Monday, Oct. 3rd. Surveillance  As is Mathurin’s approaching his neighbor armed with scissors.  Police forces exist, above all, as visible assurance that the state will protect the law-abiding.  New York’s progressive politicians have hollowed out the state’s capacity to protect with a series of disastrous criminal justice “reforms.”  Such as bail laws that let violent, dangerous thugs go free.  And “Raise the Age,” which set off a teen shooting catastrophe by hiking the age of criminal responsibility.  Or insane discovery requirements that hamstring prosecutors.  In service to the same ideology, prosecutors themselves reduce charges or bring no case at all.  The fruits of these policies are not merely serious increases in crime (though crime is up: almost 30% over 2021, per the latest data).  They produce an overall malaise that comes from Gothamites no longer having any confidence that the justice system will do anything.  For latent sociopaths among us, it’s a license to live out their violent urges.  The video of the killings is hard to watch.  But it should be required viewing for any and all New York electeds.  They need to see the world they’ve made."

WPBN/WGTU obtained the prosecutor’s dispositional report related to the incident. Wexford County Prosecutor Corey Wiggins said that deadly force was justified, and he will not authorize criminal charges against the officer.  On Aug. 12, Cadillac Police officers were called to a residence for a reported breaking and entering of a residence. The suspect was carrying a machete and banging on the home, the report said.  When officers arrived, they found the 49-year-old suspect in a nearby backyard. He was holding the machete to a dog’s throat, the report said. He did not comply with an officer’s commands and rushed the officer with the machete in hand. The officer shot him, resulting in a fatal injury."

A total of 147 people were shot over the course of three years, from 2019 to 2021, according to the report released by the agency this week. Almost all of those happened as the federal agency tasked with fugitive searches arrested people on warrants, including for crimes like assault and homicide. The total includes shootings that killed people and those that left people injured. It’s a step toward transparency for federal law enforcement, and comes at a time when data about police shootings remains scarce, years into a national reckoning over police brutality and racial injustice. Experts say detailed data is essential to tackling the issue, but comprehensive information for the U.S. is still lacking. U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis ordered the review last year, saying it reflects the seriousness of shots fired by officers. The report does not include information on whether the shootings were deemed legally justified nor data on more recent shootings, though it does say that those outlined in the report were independently investigated. The aim was to study policies, training, tactics and equipment to figure out ways to make shootings less likely or destructive in the future, the report released Tuesday states. One deputy U.S. Marshal was killed during the three-year period: Chase White, who was fatally shot serving a fugitive arrest warrant against a man accused of stalking a female police sergeant in Tucson, Arizona. Officers were injured by gunfire 13 times and suffered other injuries six times during the period of the report, which was composed on a fiscal year schedule. The shootings were spread across the country, with the largest number happening in regions in the West and in Texas. It found that more than half of the officers who fired shots were from other police agencies working with the deputies on task forces. Of the 266 officers involved with shootings, just under 40% were deputies. That finding has the Marshals âcommitted to enhancing USMS federal oversight” of task-force officers. The Justice Department began allowing local officers working with federal law enforcement to begin wearing body cameras in 2020, reversing a policy that had strained its relationship with some law enforcement agencies quicker to adopt their usage. There are nearly 4,000 deputy U.S. Marshals, and they work with more than 3,500 task force officers from departments around the U.S., the report states. The Marshals also transport federal prisoners, protect witnesses and provide court security. The agency will also review their policies about making arrests involving cars after finding that nearly half of the shootings happened as Marshals tried to arrest people in or around vehicles. Ten percent of those shootings also left officers injured. The report doesn’t specify whether any of the cars were moving at the time; federal use-of-force policy discourages shooting at or from moving vehicles. The country’s overall dearth of detailed information about police shootings, especially those that aren’t fatal, makes it hard to say how those findings fit into the national picture, experts said. The FBI began collecting the data in recent years, but has struggled with low numbers of departments participating, said Lee Friedman, a public-health professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Individual police departments are increasingly releasing use-of-force data, but it can be difficult to find and often isnât deeply detailed, said Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Carolina. The Marshals report released this week is a âgood first step,â but also leaves many questions, including details of what led up to the shooting and information on those who were shot, he said. Detailed data is important to figure out what things make police shootings more likely, and what factors drive down the risk of violence, he said. âIf we can’t identify the problems how can we come up with solutions?â Alpert said. “How do we train, how do we write policies when we don’t know what the data show?â"
